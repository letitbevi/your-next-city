When I dropped the kids off to school on Monday I took the laptop out to the garden where there was no Wi-Fi and started writing.&quot; She wrote a first draft in just 11 weeks. &quot;It was so much unbelievable fun. I had this weird confidence about it and I just blitzed it.&quot; That confidence shines through on every page of Alys, Always (to be published by Weidenfeld), a gripping thriller set in the London literary world. It begins with a car crash on an icy English road and a death which turns, slowly and unnervingly, into an opportunity for the narrator Frances Thorpe, a lowly subeditor on a newspaper books desk, to insinuate herself into the upper echelons of London literary life. Lane has firsthand experience of Frances&apos;s world, having worked as a subeditor for Tatler before going on to edit and write for the Observer, the Telegraph and Vogue. But in 2008 her journalistic career came to an abrupt halt when she nearly lost her sight. She was diagnosed with a chronic inflammation of the optic nerve and put on medication which even now &quot;just about manages the condition&quot;. Unable to do her job properly, she decided on a whim to join a creative writing course. The decision paid off. &quot;My life is quite difficult at the moment, but little bombs of joy keep going off.&quot; When I meet her at the British Library, she has just received the cover art for the American edition of Alys, Always and she&apos;s thrilled with it. She hasn&apos;t planned a follow-up. &quot;I&apos;ve got quite good at not thinking too far ahead, but when I get some space, fingers crossed, I&apos;d like to try this again.&quot; Chibundu Onuzo  As a final-year history student at King&apos;s College London, 20-year-old Chibundu Onuzo must juggle lectures, essay deadlines and writing her dissertation. But she has something else on her plate too \u2013 promoting her debut novel. The young Nigerian writer impressed the literary world when she signed a two-book deal with Faber in February last year, the youngest woman ever to do so. Onuzo&apos;s book, The Spider King&apos;s Daughter, follows a pair of Lagos teenagers, a well-to-do girl called Abike and a young street hawker, as their relationship blossoms. &quot;It&apos;s just interesting, how people from different classes relate to each other,&quot; Onuzo says. &quot;Abike should relate to the hawker in the same way as she relates to her driver. But the hawker is good-looking, and speaks English well, and that makes her pause.&quot; Growing up in Lagos, the youngest daughter of two doctors, Onuzo started writing on a whim, aged 10. She typed stories on the family computer, influenced by the American TV shows she watched at home. &quot;It wasn&apos;t seen as something abnormal, in the sense that they [my parents] didn&apos;t discourage me,&quot; she says. &quot;But at the same time, they didn&apos;t go, &apos;Our daughter&apos;s writing a book! That&apos;s amazing!&apos; I think that would have been equally very harmful.&quot; Her imagination began to turn to Nigeria when she moved to England to do her GCSEs. &quot;When you&apos;re removed from Lagos, you realise that there are a lot of interesting things to write about.&quot; Encouraged by her older sister, she sent 33 pages of The Spider King&apos;s Daughter to three agents. Capel &amp; Land recognised her potential and asked for the rest, which took her 10 months to write. Numerous redrafts later and it&apos;s ready to hit bookshops in March. &quot;As a Christian I believe it&apos;s just the grace of God,&quot; she says, reflecting on her success so far. &quot;All things work together for good.&quot; Faramerz Dabhoiwala  For Philip Larkin, famously, sexual intercourse began in 1963, and this has become something close to a prevailing view of our times. But the 42-year-old historian Faramerz Dabhoiwala decided to dig a little deeper and, after a decade of research, the result is his radical and enthralling debut The Origins of Sex, published in February. Here we discover that the &quot;first sexual revolution&quot; can be dated to the 18th century; even our prurient interest in the sex lives of celebrities can be traced to this time with the rise of media-savvy courtesans such as Kitty Fisher, who gazes out seductively from the book&apos;s front cover. &quot;I&apos;ve always been interested in cultural differences in attitudes to sex,&quot; says Dabhoiwala, whose day job is teaching history at Exeter College, Oxford. &quot;That may be because I grew up in Amsterdam in the 1970s and 1980s and then I moved back to England in Mrs Thatcher&apos;s heyday to go to university, so that was a little bit of a contrast. Most of my family live in India and they have particular attitudes to sexuality. So I have always been attuned to the subject and then I had the luck of stumbling across this huge unexplored, unexplained revolution in behaviour and I just pursued it.&quot; Dabhoiwala hopes that The Origins of Sex, with its mix of juicy anecdotes and rigorous analysis, will appeal to everyone from schoolchildren to academics and he is thrilled to have lighted on such a populist subject. &quot;I modestly hope it will change the way that people think about sex,&quot; he says. &quot;I could also say that people should read it because it will almost certainly improve their sex lives, but even if it doesn&apos;t it&apos;ll still be a really good read.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;That may be because I grew up in Amsterdam in the 1970s and 1980s and then I moved back to England in Mrs Thatcher&apos;s heyday to go to university, so that was a little bit of a contrast."], "title": "New authors for 2012", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/01/books-authors-new-talent-2012", "tags": ["Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-01T00:05:24Z", "article": "1. Give up smoking Horror at Home, Damien HirstSaatchi Gallery, London This could be a scene from an Alan Carr session in which the smokers keep on puffing, stubbing out their fags in overflowing ashtrays, appalled to see the accumulation of butts. Hirst&apos;s gigantic Brobdingnagian tray is filled with the contents of several bin bags, apparently all from a night at the Groucho club in the days when members could chain it. The work stinks, the pristine sculpture is defiled, life is going up in smoke. Let Horror at Home stiffen your resolve: it&apos;s an all-out cautionary tale. 2. Give up drinking L&apos;Absinthe, by Edgar DegasMus\u00e9e d&apos;Orsay, Paris Degas&apos;s L&apos;Absinthe, with its dead-eyed couple apparently paralysed by the eponymous drink, appalled French critics when it was first shown in 1876. How ugly and disgusting to portray an inebriated woman! In Britain, it was considered a morality tale: this is what happens when you drink too much. But in fact it is a painting of modern life, in Baudelaire&apos;s famous phrase, composed in the studio under the influence of Japanese art. She&apos;s stoned, he&apos;s drinking a hangover cure in what looks like the cold light of day. It&apos;s the morning after, or they&apos;ve been at it all night. They&apos;ve got to give up. 3. Read more The Artist&apos;s Two Youngest Sisters, Constantin HansenStatens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen A book so riveting two children can read it at once without irritating each other? If only Hansen had revealed its title. But of course his reading party is really a portrait by other means, of his younger sisters in spellbound concentration, as well as the joys of reading. He painted the girls absorbed in writing and thinking too, completing the triangle of literature. Hansen is a pioneer of the Golden Age of Danish painting. He cared for these girls on his own, from a young age, when their parents died very suddenly of typhus. 4. Give more The Boy With the Club Foot, RiberaLouvre, Paris     The Boy With the Club Foot, Ribera. Photograph: Scala    The boy is a beggar, but is he actually begging? Ribera&apos;s great portrait makes a monument of this spirited child with his defiant grin and marching pose. The viewpoint is low, so you have to look up to the boy, and the deformity all but invisible\u00a0in the shadows. He carries his crutch like a spade or weapon and appears anything but downtrodden, for all his shoeless and orphaned state. But it is a performance, an act of bravery, for in his hand is the written plea: &quot;Give Me Alms, for the Love of God.&quot; Keep him in mind in 2012. 5. Exercise more  The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch, Henry RaeburnScottish National Gallery, Edinburgh     The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch, Henry Raeburn. Photograph: The Bridgeman Art Library    The Skating Minister, Raeburn&apos;s most famous painting and world-famous as a Christmas card, marries two apparently opposing genres by making an action shot of a portrait. The figure cuts a dark diagonal through the chill grey light, his blades etching criss-cross lines on the ice, gliding forward apparently without exertion. The painting imitates his perfect\u00a0balance. Walker was a founder member of the world&apos;s first figure-skating club, which could only exercise when the loch froze. There&apos;s no excuse for the rest of us. 6. Get organised The Greenhouse: Cyclamen and Tomatoes, Eric RaviliousTate, London This is a dream of perfect order, and not just for gardeners. Indeed there is no sign of a gardener here, unless perhaps God himself is implied. Everything is beautifully organised, from the tomatoes above to the potted cyclamen below, with not a single weed nor a leaf out of place. The perspective is pristine, the watercolour so clear, light and symmetrical in both its form and content, the white paper burning through the foliage like sunlight. It is the greenhouse from paradise, the platonic ideal of organisation, a spur to action. Tidy greenhouse, tidy mind. 7. Lose weight Alessandro del Borro, Charles MellinGem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin     Alessandro del Borro, Charles Mellin.  Photograph: Gemaldegalerie, Berlin/Scala    The great fatso of art fills the frame, side to side, genially displaying his bulk \u2013 a living embodiment of too many dinners. He is depicted from below, close up, in profile and between two pillars so he seems to jam the space. But the face is shrewd and the body stout as that column. Alessandro del Borro was a Tuscan nobleman and soldier who fought for Florence, Spain and Venice, where he was nicknamed the &quot;Terror of the Turks&quot; for his ingenuity. Once thought to be by Vel\u00e1zquez, now by Mellin, the portrait gives you the man in full. 8. Learn something new A\u00fan Aprendo, black chalk drawing Goya Prado, Madrid An old man with grizzled locks and long white beard moves resolutely forward on two sticks. The body is frail, and the sticks can only give temporary stability but still the man keeps going. &quot;I am still learning,&quot; reads the caption, which might of course mean nothing more than learning to hobble, but few can resist a more biographical interpretation. A dauntless old man still out and about, still experimenting, still curious to discover something new \u2013 like Goya, who made the drawing in his 80s, still inspired to live and learn. 9. Spend more time with your family The Painter&apos;s Daughters Chasing a Butterfly, Thomas Gainsborough National Gallery, London     The Painter\u2019s Daughters Chasing a Butterfly, Thomas Gainsborough. Photograph: Bridgeman Art Library Photograph: Bridgeman Art Library    Gainsborough&apos;s much-loved painting of his daughters Mary, aged six, and Margaret, aged four or so, shows the girls breezily tripping forward after the elusive butterfly. But the day is passing. The wood is dark, a storm seems to be gathering, perhaps even dusk, and though these little bodies are moving fast, the faces are more anxious and static. Carpe diem. Childhood is brief, ephemeral as a butterfly and will pass parents by if they do not pay attention. 10. Stop procrastinating Painting, Smoking, Eating, Philip GustonStedelijk Museum, Amsterdam In this tragicomic painting, the American artist Philip Guston portrays himself as a caricatural cyclops stuck in bed with his sloth, his weak will and his ruinous appetites. He lies beneath a fat plate of ketchup-covered chips, paralysed\u00a0and anxiously eyeing the pile of old shoes that had become a motif of these later paintings. Guston is not painting, he&apos;s not\u00a0eating; in fact he&apos;s just smoking himself to death. Get up and get on, says the picture.

D&apos;Angelo, 37, hasn&apos;t released an album since 2000&apos;s landmark &quot;Voodoo,&quot; and in recent years has been plagued by addiction and arrests. But he may well be ripe for a comeback. The crooner recently announced two new shows in Amsterdam later this month. And Questlove, drummer for the Roots, told Pitchfork last month that his new album is &quot;pretty much 97% done.&quot;  Now we have a hint as to where the singer&apos;s head has been: in the 90&apos;s, apparently. D&apos;Angelo&apos;s take on the grunge classic sounds little like the original. Here the song is reimagined as a thick, trippy stew. His distinctive falsetto sounds slightly altered, the music overlaid with splices of strings and slashed keyboards.  In his Pitchfork interview Questlove mentioned that D&apos;Angelo had been creating his own keyboard patches, essentially hacking synthesizers to invent new sounds. &quot;For all intents and purposes, this album is the black version of [The Beach Boys&apos;] Smile \u2013 at best, it will go down in the Smile/There&apos;s a Riot Goin&apos; On/Miles Davis&apos; On the Corner category,&quot; he said.  Some of that inventive studiowork appears in evidence here, even if the cut is a rough one. Questlove tweeted today that the track is &quot;a demo from like 8 [years] ago done in his crib in Va.

Social entrepreneurs with truly innovative power seem to pop up at random moments, sprouting ground-breaking concepts somewhat spontaneously from the sidelines of business, science and the arts. These are new types of leaders, with a hunger for inspiration, combined with passion, purpose and a healthy dose of critical thinking. The average business school or university doesn&apos;t cater to those requirements. All that linear thinking and those dusty case histories. When you&apos;re super smart and want to learn \u2013 or simply don&apos;t fit the mould \u2013 what other choice do you have? Some of the world&apos;s greatest entrepreneurs didn&apos;t have the patience to earn their degree. They dropped out, found a way to create the type of education they needed, and changed our world. Edwin Land, co-founder of Polaroid, dropped out to focus on research. In his lifetime he registered more than 500 patents and introduced the world to instant photography. Then there&apos;s Buckminster Fuller, certainly one of the geniuses of the 20th century. He dropped out, went back, got bored, dropped out again, and went on to invent the geodesic dome. Then there&apos;s the late, great Steve Jobs, who claimed that his dropout experience forced him to be more innovative. Interestingly enough, once they&apos;d proven themselves to the world, many of these dropouts later received honorary degrees. Not to bash our honoured institutions, but it&apos;s as if they want to claim credit retroactively for creating these innovative minds. It&apos;s tempting to think of what Bucky and Steve and Edwin would have been able to achieve had their education better suited their needs. Perhaps a single institution wasn&apos;t enough \u2013 or maybe the concept &quot;institution&quot; is all wrong, and these famous dropouts had to drop out in order to find the various bits and pieces of education and inspiration and experimentation they needed to achieve that gut feeling we call &quot;vision&quot;. So why have social entrepreneurs been dropping out? 1. Natural curiosity They love to explore divergent worlds and find themselves intrigued by quirky crossovers. A predictable curriculum gets boring fast, so they start looking around for other inspiration. 2. Future orientation Instead of basing decisions on historical patterns, social entrepreneurs based their decisions a personal vision of the future, following inner instincts that can often be difficult to define according to existing standards. 3. Sense of urgency  Society is changing so quickly, education can hardly keep up. Sometimes students are better informed than their professors, and feel the urge to take action when opportunities arise. Waiting for graduation just doesn&apos;t seem to pay off. 4. Trial and error  As entrepreneurs, they often feel more can be learned from experimentation than study. Trial and error \u2013 with a few serendipitous swerves here and there \u2013 typify their career path. School makes them restless. 5. Respect for risks In their quest for a better future, social entrepreneurs dive fearlessly into uncertainty. They prefer exploration to predictability, and don&apos;t worry about the career ladder and financial security that degrees could bring. \u00a0 \u00a0 Dropping out is nothing new. &quot;College psychiatrists by no means disapprove of all dropouts,&quot; a 1962 Time magazine article says. &quot;If dropouts lack &apos;motivation&apos;, it may be a healthy reaction against too many rules and goals that \u2013 for them \u2013 are momentarily false.&quot; And perhaps dropping out actually provided the motivation needed to look elsewhere for a satisfactory learning experience, and the chance to create something no one ever imagined possible. In many ways, this explains why high-profile dropouts feed their curiosity with events such as TED, where they can marvel at the entrepreneur, the crazy scientist, the edgy artist \u2013 and be inspired by their impact on culture, business and society. Does the world need more dropouts? Probably not. But we do need more futuremakers, more social entrepreneurs. Imagine what these edgy, creative, crazy minds could achieve if they stayed in school \u2013 the right kind of school for them, that is.

Is being in film still exciting? I&apos;ve seen behind the curtain. It&apos;s a bit Wizard of Oz-like. I admit I was excited about Cannes when Hunger launched there and then that was a success and I went to Hollywood for the first time and, my God, I was thrilled, you know, seeing the big letters: HOLLYWOOD. But after a few dinners with people and drinks parties, you realise it&apos;s all about rolling up your sleeves. I got on the Paramount lot for the first time and, yes, I saw gladiators walking by and elephants and then you see the scaffolding and the trucks and it is all just work. The myth-making has disappeared for\u00a0you? Well, it&apos;s not what I make films for. So I wish I was still a punter, going to the cinema on a weekend. Dreams are nice, but now I&apos;m a bit back down to earth with the whole world of film and dreams fade. I don&apos;t want to be down on it but, if I&apos;m honest, it&apos;s very disappointing. Like when you realise there&apos;s no Father Christmas. Does that realisation cramp your work, then? Wow, you&apos;re getting existential on my ass so quickly. I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s all just false, isn&apos;t it? I recently met some people who I looked up to and admired and I found out they were just normal \u2013 there are no gods out there.           Surely the art world is the same, full of big names and egos? Oh no, film is way different. When you&apos;re 20ft tall on a massive screen and you&apos;re seeing people&apos;s lives played out on it, it&apos;s different from a nice painting. Film is important; it can be more than reportage or a novel \u2013 it creates images people have never seen before, never imagined they&apos;d see, maybe because they needed someone else to imagine them. Was Hollywood courting you? I could never make American movies \u2013 they like happy endings. I made Shame in America, but it&apos;s not a Hollywood movie. I&apos;m about challenging people. Like, properly challenging them and their assumptions. Audiences make their minds up about people they see on screen, just like they do in real life. That&apos;s what fascinates me in film. You see a character and have to think: is this person different to what I assumed he was when I first saw him? Is that because you&apos;re not quite what people would expect, especially living with a name like Steve McQueen? Ha. Maybe, maybe. I&apos;m certainly not who people think I am. I always do whatever I want to do and my films are personal to me. Hunger was about my youth, the loss of innocence when I realised what my country was doing, what was going on. Brandon in Shame is my response to being lost \u2013 I&apos;ve not been there in the sense of sexual addiction, but I&apos;ve been lost. Your films may look a bit like life, but they&apos;re very stylish, stylised even. I worked with scriptwriter Abi Morgan on Shame and she&apos;s brilliant, but she always knows where her stories and sentences are going. I don&apos;t want that; I like to start a sentence and let it take me, let it flow, so it can go anywhere. That&apos;s how I think things are in life, where we don&apos;t have a script. So I don&apos;t do storyboards. The characters and narrative dictate how I film a scene. Why did you set Shame in New York? I studied at NYU and many of my family used to live there. They&apos;ve retired to Florida or the West Indies now, but when I first went there it was 1977 and I remember Elvis dying and the blackout and we all got these T-shirts saying: &quot;Where were you when the lights went out?&quot; I was in Brooklyn, seven years old. Uncles, aunts, they all left London and we used to spend summers with them. Everyone there is from somewhere. It&apos;s all about immigrants, always a new wave of cab drivers \u2013 Haitian, then Pakistani, then Russian. It&apos;s a city that can always reinvent itself and that&apos;s what I wanted for my character, somewhere to hide. Why make a film about sex addiction? When you have everything, why would you want to blow it? That&apos;s the question here. It could be drugs, drink, but here it&apos;s sex and I chose sex because people don&apos;t talk about it. Sex has a stigma that drugs or alcohol no longer have. You got a NC-17 rating in the States and that&apos;s said to be commercial suicide. When I first heard mention of NC-17, I thought they were a rap band. I didn&apos;t give a toss about that because I like the idea of doing something no one is actually talking about. It was the same with Hunger. Want, urge, need \u2013 these are the things that create drama. When I first met you, you said the only things that interested you as movie subjects were set in 1981: the Brixton riots, Bobby Sands and Spurs winning the FA Cup. Well, I&apos;m doing a film about slavery next and that&apos;ll piss off even more people in America. I&apos;m a bit over Tottenham, for some reason. But I still hope to do something about the riots with the BBC. Sadly, I wasn&apos;t here for the riots over the summer, but they even came to my mother&apos;s street, in Ealing for God&apos;s sake. I partly live in Amsterdam now, but I&apos;m still a Londoner and something&apos;s wrong. The chief of police admits to sweeteners from News Corp and gets a slap on the wrist. A kid steals \u00a340 trainers and gets 10 months; it&apos;s blatantly not fair. The rapper Smiley Culture stabbed himself? C&apos;mon, please. There are too many unanswered questions. It&apos;s not gangs \u2013 it&apos;s individuals who are fed up and want to be in a better position, but they don&apos;t know how to say it or change it. Can art address these questions? Art can&apos;t fix anything. It can just observe and portray. What&apos;s important is that it becomes an object, a thing you can see and talk about and refer to. A film is an object around which you can have a debate, more so than the incident itself. It&apos;s someone&apos;s view of an incident, an advanced starting point.

The Broken of Britain&apos;s blog says:  Much of the [welfare reform bill] is predicated on the assumption that sick and disabled people are workshy scroungers who need to be forced into the workplace. There are no workable proposals to alter working practices to fit with the demands of sickness and disability, no incentives for employers to make it more affordable and attractive to employ sick or disabled people, just ever increasing conditionality and sanctions to cure us of the scrounging nature we so clearly inherit with our medical conditions.  On the TUC&apos;s Touchstone blog, Richard Exell adds his support to the campaign, writing:  The Welfare Reform Bill has almost finished its passage through the House of Lords. This is our last chance to reach the Lib Dem and Crossbench peers who can stop this huge cut in its tracks.  Meanwhile, Welfare Advocate tweets this graph, which shows that disabled adults are twice as likely to be on low income, and have been throughout the last decade.

Following an open letter from charities, faith-based groups and senior figures in the NHS and local government in the Telegraph last week calling for social care reform, the writer of this post says:   I&apos;m no social worker but whenever we look at the council budget it is hard to avoid the feeling that the social care element of the budget is a ticking time bomb that at any time might just blow up a council&apos;s budget; especially when cuts are being made.However, I don&apos;t think social care is failing; I think the funding of social care within the local government budget is failing.That is not to say there are not regulatory or market problems or that the structure of adult social care could not be strengthened or indeed that the standard of care in some areas could not be improved. I just have a lot of time for the people I know who do that job and the work they do and can&apos;t help but feel that describing that aspect of it as failing does them, and the services they provide, a massive dis-service.  \u2022 An amusing response to the prime minister&apos;s proposals to overhaul nursing from Michael O&apos;Shea on Twitter:  I&apos;ve worked as nurse in the NHS since 79 and every year we have a &quot;Radical Shake Up&quot;   On the Guardian Professional Networks       \u2022 As the Panel of Independence in the Voluntary Sector publishes its first assessment, Dame Anne Owers urges the sector to remain independent despite the pressures of restricted funding and increased demand\u2022 Successful policies will need greater change in Whitehall: David Walker urges the Institute for Government to keep stacking up the ammunition\u2022 Why do dropouts make good social entrepreneurs, asks Claire Taylor, marketing and community director of THNK, the Amsterdam School of Creative Leadership\u2022 The chief executive of Home Group explains why the organisation is happy to publish its expenditure over \u00a3500 \u2013 and calls on all housing providers to do the same\u2022 Councils may look to local asset backed vehicles to solve the problem of funding infrastructure.

THE YOUNGEST PLAYERS WITH STATUES (2) In last week&apos;s Knowledge, we tried to find the youngest players who had statues erected of them. We got as low as 33, the age at which Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme and Simone Perotta were honoured. But a few of you can better that \u2026 &quot;The supporters of Fiorentina erected a 10-foot bronze statue of Gabriel Batistuta in 1996 (I believe),&quot; writes Alex Bertland, among many others. &quot;Batigol was 27 at the time and stayed with Fiorentina until 2000.\u00a0I am not sure how long the statue stayed up. I do not believe it lasted long. But it lasted long enough for him to play while it was up.&quot; Ffion Thomas of the Sporting Statues Project notes that Johan Cruyff was also 27 when Ajax honoured him. &quot;From extensive research on this topic, we are pretty sure that the youngest player to be statued (while still alive) is Johan Cruyff, who was unveiled outside the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam in 1974, when he was 27,&quot; says Ffion. &quot;While he had moved to Barcelona by this time, he presumably played in the stadium with his statue outside many times for Holland. More details and a photo here.&quot; Cruyff might not be the youngest, however. Anthony Hinxman points out that David Beckham was immortalised in a Buddhist temple at the aged of 25 \u2013 no, that doesn&apos;t really count \u2013 and then there is the curious case of John Arne Riise. &quot;When Norwegian Premiership club Aalesund had their new stadium opened in 2005, Olav Nils Sunde, owner of the shipping company Color Line and one of Norway&apos;s richest men, gave a statue to the club to be erected in front of the stadium,&quot; says Christopher Sandey. &quot;It was said that it had a strong resemblance to the club&apos;s most famous former player ever, John Arne Riise, but it was denied by Mr Sunde that it was a statue of Riise, who was 24 at the time of the unveiling.&quot; At least it wasn&apos;t on a fag packet in India. &quot;Two years later, when Riise played in the Champions League final, a commentator in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten demanded that the statue should be given the name of Riise,&quot; continues Christopher. &quot;The player himself then said, with typical Riise-ish humility, &apos;[The name change] is not for me to decide. Everyone sees who it is, and I know that it was made for me&apos;.&quot; THE MISERY OF THE CUP &quot;Much has been made of QPR&apos;s woeful run in the FA Cup, which now stretches to 16 games without a win,&quot; says Ross Knight. &quot;Is this a record?&quot; Our friends at Opta have confirmed that this equals the dubious record, set by Leeds United between 1952 and 1962. Their run ended on 6 March 1963, when they beat Stoke City 3-1 in the third round.

But there were a couple of managers who could better Gunn&apos;s effort. &quot;Former Manchester United manager Dave Sexton was famously sacked from the club in April 1981 despite winning his last seven games in charge,&quot; wrote Phil Kayes.&quot; He was blamed for failing to progress from the previous season when the club had finished runners-up behind Liverpool in the league, as well as not winning any trophies in his four-year reign.&quot; And at international level, as many correspondents noted, England&apos;s beloved Graham Taylor was sacked after a 7-1 away win against San Marino.

As this year marks the 20th anniversary of my resignation from the Australian diplomatic service to work full time on global environmental issues, I felt it was time my thoughts went beyond the typical annual agonisings of exercise and alcohol consumption. My last few blogs have sought to identify some of the sustainability trends I have witnessed over the last two decades and offer some thoughts on what these may mean for action that should be taken at the Rio+20 conference in six months time. In a twist on this formula, in this piece I&apos;d like to share a more personally challenging assessment. Specifically, what did I get right, and wrong, during this time? And what might that mean for the coming year? Let&apos;s begin with the things I got basically right.\u00a0 The first is that the global ecosystem is in serious trouble and needs help. Whether one looks at climate change,\u00a0 markers of ocean and terrestrial health, the build up of chemicals and waste, or the volume of natural capital being used by our economic system, all the key indicators have worsened in the period since 1992. System thresholds or tipping points are imminent, or may already have been passed.\u00a0 The second is that government action, whether at local, national and international level, does work.\u00a0 My first environmental job was representing Greenpeace&apos;s concerns in the negotiation of the Montreal Protocol on protection of the ozone layer.\u00a0Twenty years later, the thinning of the ozone layer remains an issue but huge progress has been made in reducing the volumes of chemicals that cause the problem. This has meant that there will be far fewer human health problems than there might have otherwise been. There are many other unsung examples of positive actions, large and small, that have been taken by government. As a former diplomat and lawyer, even one who has &quot;gone rogue&quot;, I am more convinced than ever in the value of rules-based systems, incremental and messy as they inevitably are. The third is that international platforms, such as the one that helped develop and refine the ozone treaties, are incredibly important. The sluggish pace of UN climate negotiations understandably attracts negative public reactions. However forums like this play an invaluable and irreplaceable role. By enabling and encouraging exchanges of scientific, technology and economic information and ideas between governments, business and NGOs, they inform and catalyze decision making. A formal international agreement may or may not be reached, but almost all participants come away making independent decisions of their own. A formal agreement is best, but it&apos;s not the only game changing solution. It has become fashionable in some circles to trash the Kyoto Protocol. A good argument can be made, however, that without that agreement we would not now have had anywhere near the level investment in renewable energy (well over $200bn globally in 2010) and be in a position where Germany, for example, sources around 20% of its electricity from renewable sources. Finally, the engagement of business and industry is crucial. The groundbreaking work by Jeremy Leggett and others to bring together scientists, activists, and business around renewable energy has clearly borne fruit.\u00a0There&apos;s hardly a business sector now that does not have environmental standards or corporate leaders that are pioneering new technologies, management approaches and business plans that integrate sustainable development and involve stakeholder consultation. And now to what I got wrong. The first is that I underestimated the capacity for short term political and economic considerations to take the oxygen out of debate on longer term issues.\u00a0I expected the seriousness of the issues to be proportionally reflected in the priority given to them. That has not been the case. The events of the last year illustrate this perfectly. Here we are as a species, racking up unsustainable (and in some cases unrepayable) levels of ecological debt (how do you replace oil when it&apos;s gone?), and yet in all the debate on the current economic recession not one word was uttered by heads of government about the dependence of a healthy economy on a healthy ecosystem. \u00a0With our continued use of fossil fuels we are probably triggering a climate system disruption that will last millennia, but our focus remains on the next meal, paycheque, or election.\u00a0 The environment has slid down the scale of public concerns, and no-one really knows how to put it back up where it belongs. Development today is the priority; even if this will ultimately be eroded by the impacts those very policies create. Related to this, the second was that I expected to see more joined-up policy thinking emerge. At one level it makes absolute sense to deal with single issues. Marine protection needs fisheries quotas, bans on bottom trawling and conservations zones for marine protection, for example. But at another level, the real urgency of sustainable development has somehow got lost in the separation of its multiple facets into silos. I had expected economic, trade and defence ministries to have become more engaged in sustainability, if only purely out of national self-interest. After all, doesn&apos;t the ability of countries to grow new jobs and industries depend on the expansion of green industries which make smarter use of energy and raw materials, thereby minimising the adverse impacts of increasing competition for raw materials and increasing price instability? But I doubt whether a single trade or economic minister will attend the 2012 Rio conference. By contrast, we have begun to see some leading businesses recognise sustainability as a mega-trend and developing business plans. Lastly, I didn&apos;t anticipate the level of the green backlash which we have witnessed.\u00a0The capacity of important governments or companies to ignore, deny or \u2013 worse \u2013 block, widely accepted scientific findings when these didn&apos;t suit their development or business model, took me by surprise. \u00a0The reversal of Newt Gingrich&apos;s position on climate change is just the most recent illustration of a problem that in part is driven by a calculated and cynical effort to defend vested interests, and in part feeds on a human tendency (reinforced by the prevailing economic model) to discount future threats. So what does all this mean for Rio+20? Diplomats and delegates going to Rio will doubtless have learned their own lessons and be doing their best to seek a balance between short term political demands and the need to set a longer term course that leads to a more resilient and just global economy. With historic levels of public debt and unemployment in many countries, governments are not going to risk visionary action unless there are near-term and tangible economic benefits.\u00a0 This however, is where the lessons of history can be instructive. Intergovernmental agreements make a difference and are worth striving for. Whatever comes out of Rio, the sustainability agenda is here to stay and will only become more pressing. Chain draggers and contrarians should be heard and confronted as appropriate. Proposals for better policy coherence and co-ordination, measurement of how organisations and policies are helping or hindering sustainability efforts, and mechanisms for encouraging rising investment in job-creating clean and efficient technologies should be particularly welcomed. As the handling of the Eurozone crisis last year demonstrated, the governmental decision-making process is far from perfect; it is human. Governments tend to ignore inconvenient data until it is no longer possible to avoid. They then intervene with a mix of cobbled together carrots and sticks. This will not necessarily be cost-effective or neat. They will pledge unheard of sums of public money to reassure a frightened public and investors. And they will put themselves on a conference carousel that will see them continuing to intervene on a regular basis, not always consulting closely in advance with the sectors most involved. If this is what happens when unsustainable economic debt is confronted, how much more messy will things become when unsustainable ecological debt is finally addressed? If nothing else, Rio+20 is a chance to develop a game plan for what to do when this occurs. Paul Hohnen is an independent consultant.

No wonder he reaches for the clich\u00e9. His Japanese companion confirms that\u00a0this experience of coincidence is universal by proffering the Japanese idiom \u2013 &quot;We say, &apos;It&apos;s a narrow world.&apos;&quot; The title of David Lodge&apos;s Small World is a phrase that we use so often because we so often unexpectedly encounter people we know. Every meeting is a coincidence, but in novels coincidence seems to signify some hidden design. In the stories of the first great English novelist, Daniel Defoe, coincidences are taken as signs of God&apos;s providential involvement in human affairs. The point of coincidences is that characters notice them. Robinson Crusoe notices coincidences and sees a\u00a0pattern of divine purpose. Lodge&apos;s characters have other responses. When Persse, on his way to visit his aunt, meets Morris Zapp, who is visiting his former landlord, on the suburban streets of Rummidge, they find they are headed for the same road. &quot;That&apos;s a remarkable coincidence,&quot; exclaims Zapp. Of course, they are actually headed for the same house, a discovery that inspires Zapp to do &quot;a little jig of excitement&quot;. He is delighted to find that his old drinking partner, Dr\u00a0O&apos;Shea, is also Persse&apos;s uncle; it confirms his convivial confidence that he knows everyone worth knowing. Yet the reader can see, as the characters cannot, that the coincidence is a matter of plotting: it is a way of letting us know the fate of Persse&apos;s cousin Bernadette, who lived with the O&apos;Sheas when Zapp was their lodger. Pregnant by an unknown lover, she has\u00a0disappeared, but will return to play\u00a0an important part in the story. Travelling the world looking for the woman he loves, Persse keeps meeting Zapp. &quot;He hadn&apos;t been in Amsterdam three hours before he met Morris Zapp.&quot; Zapp takes every coincidental encounter as a natural consequence of\u00a0his own importance. Persse, the ing\u00e9nu, is always surprised. He also meets Miss Sybil Maiden (note the name), the retired Girtonian expert on\u00a0fertility rites, almost everywhere. &quot;Fancy seeing you&apos;re here.&quot; It must be because she is always going to conferences, but no: when they meet on a beach in Hawaii she tells him she is just taking a holiday. She is like a walking narrative principle. &quot;The surprise is mutual,&quot; she will say, never sounding in the least surprised. Whenever they meet, she provides some explanation of his misadventures according to the narrative theory of her mentor, Jessie Weston, pioneering analyst of romance\u00a0stories. Miss Maiden keeps turning up as a commentator, and because she holds the key to the story of the beautiful identical twins, Angelica and Lily, for whom Persse is searching. Coincidence is a function of the romance plot of the\u00a0novel, in which the hero quests for,\u00a0but keeps failing to claim, his beloved, while all the subsidiary characters bump into their former lovers and lost children. It is almost impossible for the critic to write a &quot;spoiler&quot; for this novel, because the reader knows that anyone who goes missing in one place will reappear in another. Philip Swallow has had a blissful one-night encounter with Joy, who has later been declared dead in a plane crash. But of course he will meet her again on one of those apparently pointless academic jaunts to a distant land. Reunited, the lovers will be enjoying a trip to Jerusalem when they will bump into his son, who just happens to be working on a kibbutz during his gap year. Satirical novelists often relish coincidence. When, near the end of David Copperfield, the protagonist is given a\u00a0tour of a new model prison by his former schoolmaster Creakle (now transmogrified into a Middlesex magistrate), he is presented with the two most exemplary prisoners, in adjacent cells. The authorities are peculiarly proud of Number Twenty-Seven and Number Twenty-Eight \u2013 who turn out\u00a0to be, respectively, Uriah Heep (&quot;I see my follies now, sir&quot;) and Steerforth&apos;s sinister valet Littimer (&quot;I am conscious of my own past follies&quot;). David feels &quot;resigned wonder&quot; at this most unlikely yet logical coincidence. Probability is not the point here; a different kind of plausibility reigns. These two consummate hypocrites belong together and, by an irrefutable satirical logic, they come together where they can practise their sinister habits of servility. So coincidence can be a special pleasure of fiction. At the heart of Lodge&apos;s novel is Cheryl Summerbee who, working at the departure desk at Heathrow airport, is the impresario of coincidences. As Cheryl directs him, Persse notices in her bag the deerstalker hat that Zapp meant to give him. He tells her that he is &quot;the very man&quot; to whom Zapp asked her to post it. &quot;Well,&quot; she says. &quot;There&apos;s a coincidence.&quot; She is hardly surprised. She meets everyone and she entertains herself by manufacturing meetings: she has the job of allocating seats, and indulges her pleasure in pairing people off. So what individuals experience as chance is in fact contrivance. She is the novel&apos;s own novelist. \u2022 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London.", "sentences": ["&quot;He hadn&apos;t been in Amsterdam three hours before he met Morris Zapp.&quot; Zapp takes every coincidental encounter as a natural consequence of\u00a0his own importance."], "title": "Small World by David Lodge", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/13/david-lodge-small-world-book-club", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "David Lodge", "Fiction"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-18T09:02:39Z", "article": "The idea of a new international airport for London has taken a first step towards reality with news that the government plans to hold a formal consultation on proposals for a Thames estuary hub. According to reports, David Cameron will announce a consultation by March \u2013 when the transport secretary, Justine Greening, will publish the government&apos;s broader aviation strategy. The airport, dubbed &quot;Boris Island&quot; after its most prominent supporter, the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, would be an international hub that could open up new routes to the far east and have capacity for connecting flights. At present, the British aviation industry says the nation is losing out to rivals airports such as Schiphol in Amsterdam and Paris Charles de Gaulle. The government has ruled out a third runway at Heathrow, as has Labour since leaving power. Colin Matthews, the chief executive of airports operator BAA, said he was &quot;pleased there was an acknowledgement that there was a need&quot; for more airport capacity, but it would take decades to construct a whole new airport. &quot;The recognition today is that it matters to the UK economy, to jobs and to growth. There&apos;s no reason why any option should be ruled out.&quot; Greening has also ruled out further runways at Gatwick and Stansted in answers to parliamentary questions. Johnson told the BBC: &quot;You can&apos;t go on expecting Britain to compete with France and Germany when we simply can&apos;t supply the flights to growth destinations.&quot; Heathrow, he said, was &quot;fundamentally in the wrong place&quot;. He said listening to the &quot;Heathrow recidivists&quot; who argue that other options for airport expansion take too long would only lead to paralysis. In his autumn statement, the chancellor, George Osborne, indicated the government would consider all options for airport expansion, which he sees as an opportunity for economic regeneration. The architect Norman Foster has drawn up plans for an estuary airport. However, planes would have to contend with the danger from millions of birds nesting there \u2013 a hazard to aviation that has also brought out opposition from the RSPB and environmental groups. A Department for Transport spokesman said: &quot;No decisions have been taken. As the chancellor made clear in his autumn statement, we will explore all the options for maintaining the UK&apos;s aviation hub status, with the exception of a third runway at Heathrow.

Her husband and coach, Jan Blankers, had refused her permission to walk with the Netherlands team in the opening parade, deeming it \u201ctoo tiring\u201d. But the Dutchwoman, who went on to emulate Jesse Owens\u2019s four gold medals at the Berlin Olympics 12 years earlier, embodied the archbishop\u2019s aspirations more than anyone else, demolishing prejudices about gender, age and motherhood and, as a pioneer and standard-bearer who inspired millions, establishing the legitimacy of women\u2019s sport in an Olympic movement that had been the preserve of male competitors until 1928.

Impressed by her effervescence \u2013 she used to run at full pelt on errands, vaulting the garden gate \u2013 Arnold took her along with him to local meetings where she quickly began to win multiple events. She also showed immense promise at swimming and skating but concentrated on athletics after joining the Amsterdam Dames\u2019 Athletic Club in 1935 at the age of 16, cycling the 18 miles there and back from her home in Hoofddorp. A year later she set a national record for the 800m, an event that would have precluded her from Olympic glory. At the Amsterdam Games in 1928 Lina Radke won the 800m in world-record time but six of the nine runners in the final had collapsed with exhaustion in extreme humidity and the event was banned until 1960. Blankers-Koen\u2019s versatility saved her from international obscurity and her aptitude for sprinting and jumping earned her a place in the Dutch team for the 1936 Olympics where she finished sixth in the high jump and fifth as a member of the 4x100m relay team. In Berlin she met Owens, his autograph becoming her most treasured possession. \u201cWhen I met him again at the Munich Olympics in 1972,\u201d she recalled, \u201cI said I still have your autograph, I\u2019m Fanny Blankers-Koen. He said: \u2018You don\u2019t have to tell me who you are, I know everything about you.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that incredible? Jesse Owens knew who I was.\u201d In 1938 she set her first world record, 11sec dead for the 100 yards, and won bronze medals in the 100m and 200m at the European Championships held in Vienna. The Dutch press predicted that the 1940 Olympics, scheduled to be held in Helsinki, would be her stage to shine. However, international sport was suspended on the outbreak of war in 1939 and Blankers-Koen spent the next six years at home near Amsterdam which was occupied following the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940 and not liberated until the Nazis officially surrendered in May 1945. In 1940 she had married her coach, Jan Blankers, twice a former national triple-jump champion who was 14 years her senior. Domestic sport continued under occupation and Blankers-Koen set six world records \u2013 in the high jump, long jump, 80m hurdles, 100 yard dash, 4x110 yard relay and 4x200m relay \u2013 from 1942-44. All were achieved after the birth of her son and in the face of criticism that she was acting selfishly by not retiring to devote herself solely to motherhood. The family survived the Hongerwinter of 1944-45, when the German blockade cut off supplies of food to the Nazi-occupied regions of the Netherlands and famine was widespread, and she gave birth to Fanneke in 1945, the year of liberation. She did not train during the latter stages of pregnancy but after seven months off she resumed her regime, absurdly light by modern standards, of twice weekly two-hour sessions, taking the children with her to the track in the basket of her bicycle. \u201cWhat will happen to my milk supply if I train and race?\u201d she asked her doctor. Her concerns were assuaged enough to attempt to carry on when he replied: \u201cYou won\u2019t know until you try.\u201d At the first post-war European Championships, held at the Bislett Stadium in Oslo in August 1946, Blankers-Koen won the 80m hurdles, anchored the 4x100m squad to gold and finished fourth in the high jump. In 1948, at the age of 30, she ran a world-record equalling 11.5sec for the 100m but was subjected to intense criticism for stating her intention to travel to London for the Olympics. \u201cI got very many bad letters, people writing that I must stay home with my children and that I should not be allowed to run on a track with \u2013 how do you say it? \u2013 short trousers,\u201d she told the New York Times in 1982. \u201cBut I was a good mother. I had no time for much besides my house chores and training, and when I went shopping it was only to buy food for the family and never to buy dresses. \u201cOne newspaperman wrote that I was too old to run, that I should stay at home and take care of my children. When I got to London, I pointed my finger at him and I said: \u2018I show you.\u2019\u201d Probability suggests she was referring to Jack Crump, who was not only the honorary secretary of the British Amateur Athletic Board and team manager of the Olympic athletics team but also a BBC commentator and Daily Telegraph athletics correspondent. What is certain is that Crump\u2019s famous pre-Games verdict, that Blankers-Koen was \u201ctoo old to make the grade\u201d, was as miscalculated and provocative a sporting prediction as the one Alan Hansen delivered on Manchester United\u2019s title ambitions after one game of the 1995-96 Premier League season. A pre-Games stipulation that athletes could enter only a maximum of three individual events meant that Blankers-Koen was forced to forgo the high and long jumps in which she was the current world record holder. Germany and Japan were barred from participating at London 1948 and the Soviet Union declined an invitation to compete. Great Britain, mired in austerity to pay back the debts accrued during the second world war, was not even able as host to supply food for the visiting athletes who had to bring their own provisions to London. Based with four other teams at St Helen\u2019s school in Norwood, Blankers-Koen took the train to Wembley for each of her events, completing her journey on foot. Her first event was the 100m and she won her heat and semi-final comfortably. Clement Attlee, in his opening address as prime minister, had said: \u201cMay the weather be fine, the events well contested and may records be broken.\u201d He was to be disappointed with the first of these ambitions, much of the athletics programme took part in wet and windy conditions. Blankers-Koen felt that the margins of victory she achieved to qualify for the final had been deceptive, thinking her fellow sprinters had been holding themselves back. But wearing the white shirt and orange shorts of the Dutch team, her knees pumping high and her head held back, she discovered that her pre-eminence had not been an illusion, storming to the tape three yards ahead of Great Britain\u2019s Dorothy Manley. \u201cIf I won gold I had told my father he should dance around the table,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the radio I told him it was time to start dancing after I won the 100m.\u201d That night back at her digs she told her husband: \u201cI am an Olympic champion and I don\u2019t want to run any more.\u201d She said she had achieved her goal and that she was missing her children but Jan knew her better, an impression her daughter, who did not subscribe to the common perception of her mother in later years as a benevolent and modest person, recounted in Kees Kooman\u2019s biography Een Koningen Met Mannenbenen \u2013 A Queen with Man\u2019s Legs. \u201cMy mother never loved herself and, the other way round, she could not give love and friendship herself to other people,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother only enjoyed herself when she was being worshipped.\u201d Blankers told her to go to bed and rest for the following day\u2019s hurdles heats and she qualified with ease. The final, however, was her toughest race so far and Blankers-Koen said she had felt intimidated by the home favourite Maureen Gardner\u2019s form in the preceding races. She started poorly. \u201cNobody could have felt less like a champion,\u201d she said. \u201cMy knees trembled. I hit the fifth hurdle, my style went to pieces and I staggered home like a drunkard.\u201d The roars of the crowd as the Dutchwoman and Britain\u2019s Gardner seemed to hit the tape, literally neck and neck, suggested to Blankers-Koen that her rival would get the decision but, as she told the Sunday Times\u2019 David Walsh in 1999, she thought she had nicked it. \u201cI just leaned forward enough to get in front of Maureen. I leaned so low, the tape cut my neck and the blood trickled on to my vest.\u201d She was right, she had won and Jan embraced her. \u201cSee, you aren\u2019t too old after all,\u201d he said. Again she said she felt she had achieved enough and tried to withdraw from the 200m. Sobbing in the Wembley dressing rooms minutes before the start of her heat she told her husband she wanted to go home. \u201cYou can go home if you wish,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in time you will be sorry. Just go out there and try to make the final, that will be enough.\u201d She stormed into the final and on 6 August, after a rain delay, slaughtered the field, beating Britain\u2019s Audrey Williamson into silver by 0.7sec, still the largest margin of victory in an Olympics 200m final. That night she had the party she craved after winning the 100m, going to a party in the West End with journalists and savouring a glass of wine. The next morning she went shopping, spending so long choosing her ideal raincoat that by the time the crowded train delivered her to Wembley her team-mates in the relay squad had already begun warming up on the track.   Related: Ten to watch: meet Team GB's sporting superheroes    She was running the anchor leg and the efforts of Xenia Stad de Jong, Gerda van der Kade-Koudijs and Nettie Witziers-Timmer had put her in fourth place when she received the baton, a few yards behind Australia\u2019s Joyce King. \u201cI thought to myself I could never win this, never, never, never,\u201d she said. \u201cThen with 50m to go I thought: \u2018Maybe I have a chance.\u2019 I ran faster than I have ever run, getting closer all the time, until a couple of metres from the line, I went into the lead.\u201d Two days later she boarded a train at Liverpool Street for Harwich and the journey home to Amsterdam. In her luggage were the four gold medals, 64 years later still the greatest individual haul by a woman track and field athlete, at a single Olympic Games. She went home to receive Queen Juliana\u2019s praise, a knighthood in the Order of Orange Nassau and a gift of a bicycle from the people of Amsterdam. But more than that she went home with the spoils of victory over sexism that kept the Archbishop of York\u2019s beacon of hope burning for the women of the world. What the Guardian wrote5 August 1948 The King and Queen entered the Royal Box here today a few moments too late to see one of the finest races so far in the London Olympic Games. They missed seeing F Blankers-Koen (Holland) pressed so hotly to the last inch of the women\u2019s 80 metres hurdles by both M Gardner (Great Britain) and SB Strickland (Australia) that though she won in a new world and Olympic record time of 11.2sec, Gardner was so close that they both returned the same time and Strickland was barely a yard away. Blankers-Koen is easily the outstanding all-round woman athlete of her day. Off the track she is as feminine as man\u2019s capricious heart could wish. On it not only is she as expert technically as most men champions but her actual foot and leg movements are straight like a man\u2019s rather than a woman\u2019s and temperamentally she is a lesson to all. She is cheerful before going to her mark, is as steady as a rock on it and then starts as though she herself had been fired. In today\u2019s final Gardner was at her best and much cooler than yesterday. She actually had the better of the start and led over the first hurdle. At the seventh flight, however, the Dutch woman was a yard ahead and Strickland was coming with a great rush. Gardner was quicker away again on the run-in, gained on both and left many of the spectators in delicious half-belief in a British victory.", "sentences": ["She also showed immense promise at swimming and skating but concentrated on athletics after joining the Amsterdam Dames\u2019 Athletic Club in 1935 at the age of 16, cycling the 18 miles there and back from her home in Hoofddorp.", "At the Amsterdam Games in 1928 Lina Radke won the 800m in world-record time but six of the nine runners in the final had collapsed with exhaustion in extreme humidity and the event was banned until 1960.", "However, international sport was suspended on the outbreak of war in 1939 and Blankers-Koen spent the next six years at home near Amsterdam which was occupied following the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940 and not liberated until the Nazis officially surrendered in May 1945.", "\u201cThen with 50m to go I thought: \u2018Maybe I have a chance.\u2019 I ran faster than I have ever run, getting closer all the time, until a couple of metres from the line, I went into the lead.\u201d Two days later she boarded a train at Liverpool Street for Harwich and the journey home to Amsterdam.", "She went home to receive Queen Juliana\u2019s praise, a knighthood in the Order of Orange Nassau and a gift of a bicycle from the people of Amsterdam."], "title": "50 stunning Olympic moments No10: Fanny Blankers-Koen wins four golds", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jan/18/fanny-blankers-koen-olympic-moments", "tags": ["Athletics", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games 1948", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-18T20:10:14Z", "article": "Downing Street told Boris Johnson on Wednesday that he had killed off any moves towards an airport in the Thames estuary ahead of the next general election after an announcement by the London mayor was seized on by the Liberal Democrats. David Cameron and George Osborne, who have become alarmed by growing business anxiety about their opposition to expanding Heathrow, had indicated they were warming to the idead of a new airport which would assume Heathrow&apos;s role as a hub. But Johnson was told that he had handed a gift to the Lib Dems, who are opposed to any airport expansion in the south-east, when he briefed the Daily Telegraph that Downing Street had signed up to his proposal. A Whitehall source said: &quot;Boris is not going to get it. Yes to scoping on a new airport, but he won&apos;t get it. The way this has plopped out in the Telegraph, no doubt via Boris&apos;s team, has given people a chance to kill it.&quot; The Lib Dems will support a consultation by Justine Greening, the transport secretary, on how to maintain a hub, but they will oppose any new airport. A Lib Dem source said: &quot;We are against airport expansion in the south-east. We are happy to go along with the consultation, but we have a policy which will not change.&quot; Johnson was upbeat on Wednesday evening, after he outlined his plans to a meeting of the Conservative party&apos;s 1922 committee. &quot;We must not count our chickens or over-egg this \u2013 to continue with a chicken metaphor \u2013 [but] the government is still looking at all the options. &quot;But George really gets the point about regeneration and jobs in the Thames estuary and the amazing capacity of a big transport hub to drive Britain&apos;s competitiveness for a long time to come.&quot; The proposed airport would be an international hub that could open up new routes to south-east Asia and have capacity for connecting flights. At present, the British aviation industry says the nation is losing out to rivals airports such as Schiphol in Amsterdam and Charles de Gaulle in Paris. The government has ruled out a third runway at Heathrow, as has Labour since leaving power, a current political reality that has been reluctantly accepted by the industry. Colin Matthews, the chief executive of airports operator BAA, said he was &quot;pleased there was an acknowledgement that there was a need&quot; for more airport capacity, but it would take decades to construct a whole new airport. &quot;The recognition today is that it matters to the UK economy, to jobs and to growth. There&apos;s no reason why any option should be ruled out.&quot; Greening, however, has also ruled out further runways at Gatwick and Stansted in answers to parliamentary questions. Johnson told the BBC: &quot;You can&apos;t go on expecting Britain to compete with France and Germany when we simply can&apos;t supply the flights to growth destinations.&quot; Heathrow, he said, was &quot;fundamentally in the wrong place&quot;. He said listening to the &quot;Heathrow recidivists&quot; who argue that other options for airport expansion take too long would only lead to paralysis. In his autumn statement, Osborne indicated the government would consider all options for airport expansion, which he sees as an opportunity for economic regeneration. The architect Norman Foster has drawn up plans for an airport on the Isle of Grain, the easternmost point of the Hoo peninsula, with four runways and which could handle 150m passengers a year \u2013 double the current number passing through Heathrow. It is the latest in a range of proposals dating back decades for the estuary, including a mooted &quot;Boris Island&quot; airport at nearby Shivering Sands. Aircraft would, however, have to contend with the multitudes of birds that flock in the area \u2013 a hazard to aviation and an issue that has brought opposition from environmental groups. The RSPB said it was a vital habitat for wildfowl and wading birds. Balpa, the pilots&apos; union, said it would seek reassurances on the dangers posed by birdstrikes, as well as potential air traffic conflicts with Brussels, Heathrow and London City airports.", "sentences": ["At present, the British aviation industry says the nation is losing out to rivals airports such as Schiphol in Amsterdam and Charles de Gaulle in Paris."], "title": "'Boris Island' airport plan grounded over Johnson's briefing to Telegraph", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/18/boris-island-thames-estuary-airport-grounded", "tags": ["Transport policy", "Transport", "Politics", "Boris Johnson", "London", "UK news", "Air transport", "Airline industry", "Business", "Thames estuary airport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-19T20:40:33Z", "article": "If you&apos;re overweight or you smoke, you won&apos;t be able to have your hip replaced or your gallbladder removed. Before being put on a waiting list, you&apos;ll have to make efforts to mend your wicked ways. That is what one consortium of GPs in Hertfordshire has decided. And with the government determined to save \u00a360bn from the NHS, it&apos;s unlikely to be the last to agree to this kind of rationing of resources. Fair enough, you may say. The risks of operations are reduced if you are slim and don&apos;t smoke. Obesity contributes to osteoarthritis of the hip and gallstones, as well as diabetes and high blood pressure. Every smoker in the land must know that they are running an increased risk of lung cancer, and lung and heart disease. Clearly, the risks of anaesthetic complications are higher if you&apos;re a heavy smoker or very fat. And why should slim, non-smoking taxpayers bear the cost of the lumpen puffers? But this cannot be a defensible position. The Hertfordshire GPs are surely going to have to rethink. Their ruling will potentially affect nearly one quarter of all adults in their area (in 2009 22% of men and 24% of women in England were obese \u2013 with a body mass index over 30), and a third of women and nearly half of men if they include overweight people (with a BMI of 25-30). It is completely unrealistic to assume that telling people they can&apos;t go on the waiting list for a much-needed operation until they lose weight will yield any result except despair. Fat is a class issue nowadays. The richer you are, the less likely you are to be fat. Healthy food&apos;s expensive. The factors are complex, and responsibility lies with individuals, schools, health professionals, government and the food and advertising industries \u2013 not with a bunch of GPs flexing their commissioning muscle. The same goes for smoking, although at least you can say you&apos;ve quit smoking and, presumably, get your place on the waiting list. You can&apos;t wake up one day and decide to be slim. There is no end to this judgmental view of healthcare rationing. Why can&apos;t the fat person have a gallbladder out when the alcoholic has a liver transplant? Why should we treat the sexually transmitted disease a man gets from a wild stag night in Amsterdam? What about the melanoma that develops after a lifetime of sunbathing? By all means educate, instigate screening, bring in public health measures to promote healthy living. But spare us this nasty, mean-spirited, discriminatory and frankly vindictive approach to &quot;care&quot;. But maybe you&apos;re reading this and feeling smug. You may be slim and a non-smoker, and feeling pretty good that if you ever need an operation, it&apos;ll be a shoo-in. With all the fatties, smokers and other pariahs excluded, waiting lists should be non-existent. You may want to know about the extent of NHS rationing being enforced throughout the country. PoLCE stands for Procedures of Limited Clinical Effectiveness: a list of treatments you may find you can&apos;t get on the NHS in your area. It includes operations for piles, varicose veins (no matter how severe), hernias \u2013 and, in my part of London, tonsillectomy. A 16-year-old girl who has had six documented episodes of severe tonsillitis in a year, was told by a local specialist that she needs to have her tonsils removed. She has missed weeks off school during an exam year and suffered educationally and socially. The procedure has been turned down. As her GP, I have appealed on her behalf. However, that was six months ago, and the appeal has not been heard yet, and is likely to be rejected. Local GP commissioning groups are making their own decisions about how to implement the rationing that the government insists on. You may well be affected \u2013 even if you lead the most impeccable lifestyle and have the most honed body in the village.

In the Yemen section of the game, where Nathan and Sully explore a vast underground crypt, lots of the tasks are based around optical illusions \u2013 there&apos;s a room full of statue parts suspended at various angles, which must be viewed from a specific place to create a complete picture. In another area, a duo of strange symbols on a wall need to be looked at through a series of shutters in order to convert them into a zoetrope-style animated sequence. These ingenious puzzles are not only fun to solve, they accentuate the mysticism of the narrative. How did Naughty Dog come up with this brilliant idea? Ideas are the currency of creativity \u2013 yet strangely, we&apos;re often taught to undervalue them. There&apos;s an anecdote about Peter Molyneux being approached by a fan who told him, &quot;I have a great idea for a game,&quot; to which the famed designer replied: &quot;I have a great idea for a painting.&quot; Of course, an idea in itself is worthless; it&apos;s the implementation that&apos;s key. But if you&apos;re sitting in front of Game Maker 8.1 or your Unity3D interface, with plenty of coding nouse but no inspiration, how do you get started? &quot;It&apos;s all about reference material,&quot; said Andy Schatz, when I asked him about how newcomers to game design should think about ideas. Schatz is the designer of Monaco, an IGF award-winning co-op stealth game, tipped by many to be the crossover hit of 2012. &quot;All art is just an evolution of existing art. But the art we call innovative is the art that takes the biggest evolutionary leaps. Sometimes this takes a lot of experimentation to get right. Don&apos;t be afraid to take those leaps and throw out the experiments that don&apos;t work out!&quot; This is a widely accepted, glibly post-modernist stance on creativity \u2013 that there are no new ideas, just new combinations of existing concepts. At the Develop conference in Brighton last year, Mark Green \u2013 from the creative development group at Sony Worldwide Studios \u2013 gave an intriguing talk on how the company&apos;s in house studios came up with new ideas. &quot;A classical definition of a new idea is one or more existing ideas combined in a new way,&quot; he said. &quot;So we might take the idea of a monster movie, combine it with the idea of YouTube and come up with the idea of Cloverfield \u2026&quot; That essentially seems to be how Hollywood has operated for the past 30 years, but is it a dead end for indie developers who don&apos;t want to make the gaming equivalent of &quot;Godzilla on a shaky cam&quot;? Green doesn&apos;t think so \u2013 he sees investigating accepted game mechanics as a key way to spark inspiration. &quot;A lot of what we&apos;ve done has been about taking techniques that have been used in other industries,&quot; he says. &quot;There are very innovative companies working in product development \u2013 for example, the design consultancy IDEO is one. They use exercises that allow you to think differently about problems. &quot;There&apos;s one known as the challenge technique where you sit down and think about all the assumptions we have about something. Then you all start to remove some of those things to destabilise the fundaments and see how that can help generate new ideas.&quot;  In his Develop talk, Green discusses taking an accepted genre \u2013 the RTS for example \u2013 then writing down its six absolutely vital elements. There is some kind of battle going on, there are at least two sides, there are various units, there are resources, etc. Now the idea is to roll a dice and remove one of the tenets. What would the resulting game work like? Removing just one rule can result in a fundamentally different gameplay experience. &quot;There&apos;s another very simple exercise we sometimes carry out,&quot; Green says. &quot;It&apos;s called A+B. We print out a list of 200 game titles, put them in a hat, then pull two out. We might get something like Professor Layton and Call of Duty: Black Ops. That&apos;s not the end of the process \u2013 we&apos;re not literally going to make Call of Duty and the Curious Village. But what we&apos;re doing is using this unusual combination as a starting point. &quot;We may combine the theme of one with the gameplay of the other \u2013 so, perhaps a puzzle game with a military theme. Or it could be an FPS with strong puzzle elements. Or we&apos;d take the audience of one and apply it to the other \u2013 so a first-person shooter for family audiences. These are just good brain-storing start points, and this exercise take you down paths you may not previously have considered.&quot; This is a quite insular way of thinking about games and creativity, but it can work. Dan Marshall, the Bafta award-winning designer of games such as Time Gentlemen Please and Privates, is a great believer in immersing yourself in games and game culture. &quot;Go to the pub and talk about them,&quot; he says. &quot;Great ideas do come up like this \u2013 but you need to take a pen and some paper because otherwise they&apos;ll be lost forever in a half-drunken haze. &quot;Oh and play lots of games. Sometimes you expect a game to do something, but it goes in a totally different direction. Well, that thing you were hoping it would do is a completely original idea \u2013 it&apos;s all yours and you can use it yourself. Use other people&apos;s work as a springboard.&quot; It doesn&apos;t have to be new games either. Hideo Kojima, after all, became interested in the whole idea of stealth and avoidance by playing Space Invaders and hiding behind the defence shields. Charles Cecil, designer of the Broken Sword titles, agrees with the idea of immersing yourself in games, but sounds an extra note of caution. &quot;Don&apos;t try to write games in a genre that you don&apos;t have a passion for, because you will fail,&quot; he says. &quot;When you&apos;re coming up with ideas, try to keep in mind all the things you love about a genre, and innovate on those; add to them in an interesting way. You&apos;ve got to focus on what you love, but it has to be about the mechanics. &quot;It&apos;s no good saying, I&apos;m going to design an FPS that&apos;s based underwater, because that in no way suggests you&apos;re going to innovate on the gameplay itself. Everything needs to be driven by gameplay.&quot; In short, you need to think like an engineer rather than an artist. Although admittedly, art has proved a fecund source of game ideas. Tetsuya Mizuguchi was inspired by Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky to create Rez; Ken Levine drew on the Art Deco movement for Bioshock; Uncharted co-lead designer Richard Lemarchand looked at the works of Victorian painters such as David Roberts and Caspar David Friedrich for the exotic locations that Nathan Drake discovers. And countless dungeon designers have looked at the complex works of MC Escher and Giovanni Battista Piranesi for their labyrinthine environments.  Beyond art there is\u2026 everything. Lemarchand talks about finding inspiration and awe in dramatic natural wonders \u2013 the Giant&apos;s Causeway, the fronds of a fern, the fractal self symmetry of Romanesco broccoli. &quot;I always try to get ideas for games from non-game sources,&quot; says Schatz. &quot;I like to think of game design the way Michelangelo thought of sculpting \u2013 he was just discovering the object inside of the stone, and the chisel was just there to reveal it. When you build a game out of a non-game concept, the designer has to whittle that subject matter down and find the game inside it. So I&apos;ve made games inspired by animal ecosystems, heist movies, conversations, documentaries\u2026&quot;  There is also biography and experience. Miyamoto was inspired to create Legend of Zelda by his childhood spent exploring the countryside near his home, and daring himself to wander into caves. Jenova Chen of thatgamecompany told Edge that he came up with the idea for Flower after seeing the grass fields along a Californian highway for the first time after arriving in the country from Shanghai. Ideas are experiences processed. But they are also about seeing the value in empty time. In a blog post titled Where do you get your ideas, an exasperated Neil Gaiman writes: &quot;You get ideas from daydreaming. You get ideas from being bored. You get ideas all the time. The only difference between writers and other people is we notice when we&apos;re doing it.&quot; The skill is in utilising these fleeting moments of inspiration. &quot;When you&apos;re making games, you&apos;re constantly having ideas that are brilliant but completely wrong for that project,&quot; says Marshall. &quot;So store them up in the back of your mind; every indie developer I know has a list of games tucked away in the damp, dark bits of their brain queuing up to be made. &quot;You should also keep tabs on the stuff you throw away: some game ideas are completely wrong for what you&apos;re working on, but sing in a different project. We killed time travel mechanics in Ben There, Dan That because it just didn&apos;t gel, but when we decided on a sequel it was the perfect fit.&quot; Interestingly, Hidetaka &quot;Swery&quot; Suehiro, the designer of cult survival horror adventure Deadly Premonition, has the exact opposite approach. In his GDC speech last year he provided a seven-point guide to game design and the last one was simply to use everything, every idea, whenever it occurs to you. Don&apos;t save it, don&apos;t lose it, just stick it in there. Hence, in Deadly Premonition, the town of Greenvale is shaped like a dog raising its paw. Swery had that idea and he put it in. This is the stuff that cult genius is made of.  One of the most important philosophical ideas about \u2026 ideas \u2026 is that they don&apos;t just pop into your head fully formed. The science writer Steven Johnson has a brilliant YouTube video explaining this, which I&apos;ve embedded below.            This reflects some advice on creativity in Richard Wiseman&apos;s excellent book 59 Seconds, which suggests that sometimes it&apos;s best to leave an idea and go off to do something else \u2013 a word puzzle, a long walk \u2013 anything to get your mind off the creative problem at hand, if only for a few minutes. He refers to the work of psychologists Ap Dijksterhuis and Teun Meurs from the University of Amsterdam; in a report titled, Where Creativity Resides: The Generative Power of Unconscious Thought, they posited that leaving a task for just a few moments allows your unconscious mind to have a bash at it, quietly working away on the logistics without your conscious thoughts bellowing in its ear. Dan Marshall puts this in very simple terms: &quot;&apos;Play&apos; the game in your head at night \u2013 this is where everything gets fleshed out, for me.&quot; It seems that retaining the purity of those early, half-unconscious ideas is the key to great games. Lemarchand discusses the process of &quot;design by subtraction&quot; during his fascinating talk, Beauty and Risk: Why I love indie Games, given at IndieCade and GameCity last year.             If you don&apos;t have time for the whole thing, forward to 15:00. Here, he talks about how his approach to design ideas is influenced by the &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy of William Morris \u2013 &quot;put nothing in your home that you don&apos;t know to be useful or believe to be beautiful&quot;. Game ideas are the same. This was also a concept employed by Fumito Ueda while designing the wonderful Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. In his classic 2002 GDC talk on the creation of the games (conveniently entitled Design by subtraction), he talks about how the idea for Ico came from just the idea of a young boy holding hands with a slightly older girl, and that every subsequent design decision was made to retain the purity of that image.  So back to those intriguing puzzles in Uncharted 3. Keen to find out how Naughty Dog arrived at them, I contacted Richard Lemarchand and asked him. He told me that his co-lead designer Jacob Minkoff actually created a huge open environment and filled it with optical illusions \u2013 he then toyed with each one until he had a couple that really worked; these are the ones we have in the final game. Sometimes creativity is just about putting yourself in a position where the only possible outcome is a good idea.", "sentences": ["He refers to the work of psychologists Ap Dijksterhuis and Teun Meurs from the University of Amsterdam; in a report titled, Where Creativity Resides: The Generative Power of Unconscious Thought, they posited that leaving a task for just a few moments allows your unconscious mind to have a bash at it, quietly working away on the logistics without your conscious thoughts bellowing in its ear."], "title": "Genius or elimination: where do good game ideas come from?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/jan/20/where-do-game-ideas-come-from", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "PC", "PS3", "Xbox", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-20T22:45:00Z", "article": "Last year saw numerous new London hotels open in anticipation of the Olympics, a trend that shows no sign of slowing. Getting highest profile this year will probably be the reinvention of the venerable Caf\u00e9 Royal (alrov.co.il), due to reopen this summer. In 1865, a bankrupt French wine merchant, Daniel Nicolas Th\u00e9venon, fled to London to escape imprisonment. Missing the bars and restaurants he knew at home, he decided to create a little piece of belle \u00e9poque Paris on Regent Street. The result was the Caf\u00e9 Royal, to which the beau monde flocked. And very racy it became. It was here that Oscar Wilde hallucinated on absinthe and courted Lord Alfred Douglas, boxing matches were fought in the ballroom before audiences in evening dress, and an unfortunate night porter was shot dead in the head. Now part of the Israeli Alrov group (which includes the just-opened Conservatorium in Amsterdam and the futuristic Mamilla in Jerusalem), it&apos;s been transformed into a 160-room hotel by the architect David Chipperfield, whose essentially contemporary scheme (incorporating a not-quite-20m indoor pool, spa and hammam) sits comfortably with the original Grade I-listed Louis XVI and Empire-style conceit. Its restaurants will include a reworking of the famous Grill and once-bohemian Domino Room, where artists Augustus John, Walter Sickert, James McNeill Whistler and Aubrey Beardsley were regulars. The forthcoming purpose-built Bulgari Hotel (bulgarihotels.com, 020-7151 1010), which opens in April on Knightsbridge, is also likely to be striking architecturally, for it&apos;s the work of fashionable Italian architect Antonio Citterio, best known for his furniture and lamps for Flos, Vitra and B&amp;B Italia. True to the standards of the jewellery brand behind it, it promises the last word in (commensurately expensive) luxe, with solid silver chandeliers in the ballroom \u2013 in recognition of Bulgari&apos;s origins as a silversmith \u2013 and woven-to-order Italian silk curtains, not to mention a substantial spa (with 25m pool tiled in green and gold mosaic), screening room, library, cigar shop and smart Italian restaurant and bar. Still on the subject of revered architects, London also gets its first Norman Foster-designed hotel on 4 June, when the 175-room Me by Meli\u00e1 (0808 234 1953, me-by-melia.com, rooms from \u00a3340), opens on the Strand. This redevelopment of what was once Marconi House incorporates its 1904 facade in an otherwise boldly contemporary building with a striking 11-storey round tower-like atrium.     Temple Court Hotel on Fleet Street, London    Half a mile or so to the east, just off Fleet Street, the 184-room Temple Court Hotel (0845 365 0000, apexhotels.co.uk, rooms from \u00a3129), opens in Serjeants&apos; Inn in the Inner Temple on 1 March, the third London outpost of Edinburgh-based family-owned Apex Hotels, which specialise in contemporary, good-value hotels. Also convenient for the City will be South Place Hotel (southplacehotel.com), which opens this summer near Liverpool Street, a seven-storey 80-room new-build boutique with Conran interiors and the first venture into hotel-keeping by the D&amp;D restaurant group, which owns the Blueprint Caf\u00e9, Kensington Place, Le Pont de La Tour, Quaglino&apos;s, Skylon and more. Its roof-terrace bar and restaurant (one of two in the hotel) will be a welcome outdoor space in this high-density district. Across town in South Kensington, the independent 110-room Ampersand Hotel (ampersandhotel.com), due to open just before the Olympics, harks back to the 19th century both in its structure (it was built in 1888) and in its eccentric, eclectic decor, which takes inspiration from the area&apos;s great Victorian museums round the corner on Exhibition Road. Z Hotels (thezhotels.com) will open a second property on Lower Belgrave Street, near Victoria station, in spring. The well-designed rooms are compact and short on frills, but contemporary, chic and, with rates from \u00a385, very cheap for London. A couple of blocks west, Belgraves (020-7858 0100, thompsonhotels.com, rooms from \u00a3301) opens on 1 February in what used to be the Sheraton Belgravia. Operated by New York-based Thompson Hotels, it seems to be striving to be more British than the British. Socialite interior designer Tara Bernerd has a taste for Union Jack cushions, and chef Mark Hix will oversee its essentially English restaurant. But Thompson is not the only American company with designs on London. The \u00fcber-modish US hotelier Andr\u00e9 Balazs (The Mercer, The Standard, Chateau Marmont) has plans to convert a former fire station in Marylebone into a hotel. This is due to open next year, as is the 195-room Shangri-La (shangri-la.com) on floors 34 to 52 of the still-some-way-from-finished Shard at London Bridge, which will start taking bookings in early 2013.", "sentences": ["Now part of the Israeli Alrov group (which includes the just-opened Conservatorium in Amsterdam and the futuristic Mamilla in Jerusalem), it&apos;s been transformed into a 160-room hotel by the architect David Chipperfield, whose essentially contemporary scheme (incorporating a not-quite-20m indoor pool, spa and hammam) sits comfortably with the original Grade I-listed Louis XVI and Empire-style conceit."], "title": "London hotels: new kips on the block", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jan/20/new-london-hotels-opening-2012", "tags": ["London holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Travel", "Hotels", "Luxury travel", "England holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-21T22:00:00Z", "article": "A small group of people will meet in Washington later this year for what they hope will be a lunch to change the world. The meal should consist of fried chicken and nothing else, but while it may look like chicken, have the texture of chicken and even taste like chicken, it will never have lived or breathed. Five years ago Peta, the world&apos;s largest animal welfare group, gave scientists until 30 June 2012 to prove they could make &quot;cultured&quot;, or laboratory meat, in commercial quantities. The first scientist to show that artificial chicken can be grown in quantity and be indistinguishable from &quot;real&quot; chicken flesh will be awarded $1m. &quot;We really do not know who will apply,&quot; said Ingrid Newkirk, president and founder of Peta. &quot;Five years ago I thought no one would. But I cannot tell any more. There is a real chance someone will claim the reward. A lot of researchers are keeping very quiet and have their cards close to their chest. Progress is being made. They are overcoming obstacles. We are very optimistic.&quot; Leading the race to show that it is possible is Mark Post, head of the department of vascular physiology at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. Post has been given $300,000 by the Dutch government and by an anonymous donor, believed by Newkirk to be a media magnate, to develop his stem cell research. He has claimed he will produce a synthetic beefburger this year. Post cannot win the Peta prize because he is working with beef, not chicken, but he has successfully grown strips of meat a few centimetres long. But his work is slow and it is proving hard to grow the meat any thicker or in large quantities. Another group of scientists, at Utrecht university in the Netherlands, is experimenting with stem cells harvested from embryos. One stem cell could potentially produce tonnes of meat, with all the stem cells from one cow being enough to feed an entire country. &quot;But this is very complex science and harder than we thought. We have found we cannot yet cultivate cells from embryos, only in principle from adult animals and then not very efficiently. I think it is a decade away and we need research money,&quot; said Bernard Roelen, professor of veterinary science. Coming from a different direction is US scientist Vladimir Mironov, former director of the Nasa-funded Bioprinting research centre at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, but now working with a Brazilian meat company. Mironov works with tissue engineering and has taken embryonic muscle cells from turkeys, bathed them in a bovine serum and successfully grown muscle tissue, but only in very small quantities. Mironov is certain tissue-engineered meat will eventually be developed: &quot;Of course there are people who think this is Frankenstein food. They see it as unnatural, but there is nothing unnatural here. We use animal cells and grow them in a cultured media. The only difference is that we don&apos;t kill any animals.&quot; The first-generation products are most likely to be chopped meat, with a long-term goal to grow muscle tissue. Potentially, any animal&apos;s muscle tissue could be grown through the in vitro process, as well as milk, cheese and eggs. So far all the meat &quot;made&quot; has been nearly colourless, tasteless and lacking texture. Scientists may have to add fat and even lab-grown blood and colourants. Professor Julie Gold, a biological physicist at Chalmers technical university in Gothenburg, Sweden, said it could take years before commercialisation. &quot;There is very little funding. What it needs is a crazy rich person.&quot; But the prize of being able to one day grow hundreds of tonnes of meat from stem cells is potentially vast, say animal welfare groups and food manufacturers. The UN&apos;s Food and Agriculture Organisation expects world consumption of meat to double between 2000 and 2050, and last year the Royal Society said the challenge of increasing global food supplies could require &quot;novel&quot; solutions like artificial meat. Cultured meat has the added advantage of requiring far less energy and space to grow. Analysis by scientists from Oxford and Amsterdam last year showed the process could be engineered to use only 1% of the land and 4% of the water compared with conventional meat. For vegetarians, the prize is less animal suffering. &quot;More than 40bn chickens, fish, pigs and cows are killed every year for food in the US alone, in horrific ways. In vitro meat would spare animals from this suffering,&quot; said Newkirk.", "sentences": ["Analysis by scientists from Oxford and Amsterdam last year showed the process could be engineered to use only 1% of the land and 4% of the water compared with conventional meat."], "title": "Race to serve up artificial chicken for a $1m prize", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jan/21/artificial-chicken-food-prize", "tags": ["Food science", "Science", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "Vegetarian food and drink", "Vegetarianism", "Animal welfare", "US news", "UK news", "World news", "Chicken"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-22T00:14:00Z", "article": "As a boy chorister in his Czech-Moravian homeland, Jan\u00e1cek (1854-1928) learned early the potential of choral writing.

He also had a second career, which developed later in his life, as a novelist and biographer. As a choreographer, Van Dantzig made more than 50 works, most of them on contemporary themes, although he also produced well-received versions of standard classics such as Romeo and Juliet and Swan Lake. Many of his ballets contain a strong thread of social criticism; he was not afraid to explore difficult subjects. The vividly theatrical Monument for a Dead Boy (1965) told the story of a boy who discovers his hitherto repressed homosexuality and is ultimately destroyed by his own desires. This ballet brought Van Dantzig international notice and was mounted for several major companies. Among the interpreters of the leading role, originally created by Van Dantzig&apos;s partner, the dancer and designer Toer van Schayk, was Rudolf Nureyev. Painted Birds (1971) was an early alert to man&apos;s ability to pollute both minds and the environment, and made extensive use of film projections to illustrate and amplify the action on stage. Its final coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre came when the music by Niccol\u00f2 Castiglioni gave way to a recording of the final chorale from Bach&apos;s St Matthew Passion, which was taken up by the cast, the choreographer and some of the company&apos;s staff. He could be light-hearted too. His ballet Ulysses \u2013 made for Nureyev, a lifelong friend \u2013 had the hero slouching around in pyjamas and dressing gown trying to avoid Penelope&apos;s vigourous vacuum cleaning. His Last Songs to Richard Strauss&apos;s song cycle was musical, restrained and moving. Born in Amsterdam to strongly leftwing parents, Van Dantzig was six when Germany invaded the Netherlands, and grew up under the occupation. He was separated from his parents and sent to the countryside where conditions were safer. There, after the liberation, he encountered a Canadian soldier with whom he formed a relationship. This provided the inspiration for his prizewinning novel For a Lost Soldier, published in the Netherlands in 1986, and later filmed and translated into English. Returning to school in Amsterdam, Van Dantzig proved a poor scholar, uninterested in most of his schoolwork. When he wandered into a cinema showing Michael Powell&apos;s The Red Shoes, his future path was decided. He took lessons with Anna Sybranda and then with Sonia Gaskell, a former Ballets Russes dancer who ran a school and a small classical company. It was clear that because of his late start Van Dantzig would never make a first-rate dancer, but there was a shortage of talented men at that time, and he was tall, good-looking, highly intelligent and prepared to work ferociously hard. He was taken into the company and by 1955 had produced his first choreography, Night Island. The previous year, Martha Graham and her company had made a first visit to the Netherlands and the effect on Van Dantzig was cataclysmic, opening his eyes to new possibilities for drama and expressiveness in dance. He travelled to New York to study Graham&apos;s technique, which was to have a strong influence on his own choreography. Van Dantzig was briefly involved in the foundation of Netherlands Dance Theatre, but when Gaskell retired in 1968 he took over as director of the Dutch National Ballet, initially sharing the role but taking sole responsibility in 1971 and remaining in the post for two decades. He had a talent for administration and showed a sure eye in importing and commissioning ballets that expanded the company&apos;s repertoire and developed its dancers. He was in demand internationally, mounting works for Ballet Rambert, the Royal Ballet (a creation starring Nureyev) and the Paris Opera Ballet among others. In 1991 he left the Dutch National Ballet to concentrate on writing and mounting works for other companies. He wrote a memoir about Nureyev that was translated into English and a biography of the Dutch artist and resistance fighter Willem Arondeus. He received the Benois de la Danse lifetime achievement award and was made knight and then officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau. He is survived by Toer. \u2022 Rudi van Dantzig, dancer, choreographer, director and writer, born 4 August 1933; died 19 January 2012", "sentences": ["Born in Amsterdam to strongly leftwing parents, Van Dantzig was six when Germany invaded the Netherlands, and grew up under the occupation.", "Returning to school in Amsterdam, Van Dantzig proved a poor scholar, uninterested in most of his schoolwork."], "title": "Rudi van Dantzig obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/23/rudi-van-dantzig", "tags": ["Ballet", "Dance", "Rudolf Nureyev", "Royal Ballet", "Ballets Russes", "Stage", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news", "Culture", "Biography", "Fiction", "Books"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-25T14:11:00Z", "article": "Whether you buy a rose from a boutique in Barcelona, a store in Manchester or a florist in Copenhagen, it&apos;s probably Italian.

A report, commissioned by ministers the last time they considered the option of a major new hub airport on the marshes east of London, found the risk of an &quot;aircraft loss&quot; after being hit by one or more birds was between one plane in 100 years and one plane in 300 years - higher than any of the other 10 major UK airports studied. The high risk was calculated even after extensive work to make the area as unattractive as possible to birds, such as cutting down woodland, draining ponds, planting artificial grass and shooting birds when necessary. Without such measures &quot;an aircraft could not operate safely in this location&quot;, said the report, adding: &quot;Even with world-class management and mitigation measures in place \u2026 it is not considered possible to reduce the risk to a level similar to that experienced at other UK airports.&quot; The report was commissioned in 2003 when Labour ministers were considering a new airport at Cliffe, on the north Kent coast; it was cited in the resulting white paper as one reason Labour rejected the Cliffe proposal, but was not published at the time. The experts&apos; view will now add new difficulties for the coalition government, which is expected to announce in March a fresh consultation on building a new airport in the same area \u2013 an idea championed by London&apos;s Conservative mayor, Boris Johnson. Although the two proposals are not identical, they are likely to be on close or even overlapping sites on the north Kent coast, between the Thames and Medway estuaries. As a result, the findings and warnings of the 2003 report should be &quot;broadly applicable,&quot; said Niall Burton, one of the original authors. Simon Buck, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association, said the risk of bird strike was only one concern they have over the site. Another is possible &quot;conflict&quot; with flight paths for Amsterdam Schiphol&apos;s six-runway airport. &quot;We feel as airlines there are lots of operational and technical issues that need to be addressed,&quot; said Buck. &quot;It [the Thames Gateway proposal] is not what we see as being the solution to a problem [of shortage of runway space].&quot; Airlines, including British Airways, are known to favour expansion of existing airports, especially Heathrow in west London. However there is also huge opposition from environmental groups, who argue that no new runways are needed if the government invests in railways and taxes aircraft fuel equally with other transport. The report will also fuel conservation concerns because, if a Thames airport was to go ahead, measures to reduce the risk of bird strikes would mean wildlife was affected far beyond the runways and buildings. Under European regulations, which cover much of the area&apos;s bird-rich salt-marshes and tidal mud-flats, developers would have to prove there was a genuine need to build a new airport, to try and mitigate environmental damage, and to compensate for any damage done. Because of the scale of the multi-billion pound project it would not be possible to compensate with alternative habitat in the area on such a big scale, said Nik Shelton, a spokesman for the RSPB. &quot;Anyway [they would] have to destroy another bit of habitat to create it, so [they would] not add to the natural environment,&quot; added Shelton. Ministers have not yet announced the exact site they will consider in the consultation, trailed by Johnson in the media last week. However a similar private proposal led by the Wembley Stadium and London &quot;Gherkin&quot; architect Sir Norman Foster appears to place a Thames Gateway airport on a site overlapping with the original Cliffe airport scheme, both of them on the Isle of Grain on the north Kent coast, between the Thames and Medway estuaries. The Department for Transport stressed &quot;no decisions have been taken&quot; on the Thames Estuary or building a new runway at Gatwick or Stansted airports. &quot;As the chancellor made clear in his autumn statement, we will explore all the options for maintaining the UK&apos;s aviation hub status with the exception of a third runway at Heathrow,&quot; said a department spokesman. &quot;The government will consult on an overarching sustainable framework for UK aviation this spring and alongside this we will publish a call for evidence on maintaining effective UK hub airport connectivity.&quot; The bird-strike report, prepared by experts from the government&apos;s Central Science Laboratory (now part of the Food and Environment Research Agency, Fera) and the British Trust for Ornithology, said the greatest risk to aircraft was from heavier birds, especially over 1kg, or flocks of 10 birds or more hitting a plane. It found that overall the highest risk bird species in the area were oystercatcher, curlew, herring gull, shelduck, wigeon, lapwing, great black-backed gull, cormorant, mute swan, greylag goose and redshank. The mix of species affected by the different new airport schemes put forward would vary, but the overall impact in the &quot;scale of numbers&quot; was likely to be the same, said Burton, head of wetlands and marine research at the British Trust for Ornithology. Burton said he was not aware of any significant changes in bird-strike mitigation, though this was not his primary area of expertise. \u2022 Get the Guardian&apos;s environment news on your iPhone with our new app. You can also join us on Twitter, Facebook and Google+", "sentences": ["Another is possible &quot;conflict&quot; with flight paths for Amsterdam Schiphol&apos;s six-runway airport."], "title": "Risk of bird strikes would make Thames Estuary UK's 'most dangerous airport'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/26/bird-strikes-thames-estuary-airport", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Birds", "Wildlife", "Environment", "Air transport", "World news", "Green politics", "Politics", "UK news", "Thames estuary airport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-26T12:58:44Z", "article": "Nicol Williamson, whose death of oesophageal cancer at the age of 73 has been announced, was\u00a0arguably the most electrifying actor of his generation, but one whose career flickered and faded like a faulty light fitting. Tall and wiry, with a rasping scowl of a voice, a battered baby face and a mop of unruly curls, he was the best modern Hamlet since John Gielgud, and certainly the angriest, though he scuppered his own performance at the Round House, north London, in 1969, by\u00a0apologising to the audience and walking off the stage. The experience was recycled in a 1991 Broadway comedy called I Hate Hamlet, in which he proved his point and fell out badly with his co-star. Williamson&apos;s greatest performance was as the dissolute and disintegrating lawyer Bill Maitland in John Osborne&apos;s Inadmissible Evidence at the Royal Court theatre in 1964. It was a role from which he never really escaped, reviving it on the stage and making the 1968 movie. The play was seen again last year at the Donmar Warehouse, with Douglas Hodge in the leading role. After a couple of chaotic performances in his own one-man show, and as the equally wild and unreliable actor John Barrymore in A Night on the Town at the Criterion theatre in London in 1994, Williamson was last sighted on the stage at the Clwyd Theatr Cymru, Mold, Flintshire, as King Lear in 2001. Its director, Terry Hands, a one-time colleague at the Royal Shakespeare Company, allowed him free rein to wander through the play, but many of\u00a0the speeches were misplaced. Like Eric Morecambe playing the piano, he\u00a0knew all the notes, but not necessarily in the right order. Still, the performance was fretted with moments of golddust and heartbreak, and you would not willingly have exchanged it for many a more competent or\u00a0predictable performance. Hands had taken the sensible precaution of cancelling the second-night performance as the first one was followed by the mother of all first-night parties, with Williamson banging out the jazz standards he loved to sing with a group of willing musicians, including the film critic Ian Christie. Williamson&apos;s talent for acting and lust for life were brilliantly recorded in a 1972 essay by Kenneth Tynan for the New Yorker which charted his haphazard preparation for a concert at the White House for President Richard Nixon. When it was published, warts and all, Williamson was furious and never spoke to Tynan again. He was born in Hamilton, near Glasgow, the son of Mary (nee Storrie) and Hugh Williamson. He trained for the stage at the Birmingham School of Speech and Drama and made his professional debut at the Dundee Rep in\u00a01960. In the following year, he appeared as Flute in Richardson&apos;s Royal Court production of A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream. He was at the Arts theatre in Women Beware Women and in Henry Livings&apos;s Nil Carborundum in 1962. With Page directing, he played Vladimir at\u00a0the Court in the first major London revival of Beckett&apos;s Waiting for Godot, partnered by Alfred Lynch as Estragon. He took his performance of Bill Maitland to New York in 1965, where he was nominated for a Tony award and came to blows with the producer, David Merrick. Although his reputation for unpredictability grew, his talent was recognised in Bafta best actor nominations for his film performances in Inadmissible Evidence, The Bofors Gun (1968) and a 1972 television film of\u00a0Brecht&apos;s The Resistible Rise of\u00a0Arturo\u00a0Ui. When Trevor Nunn presented a\u00a0season of Shakespeare&apos;s Roman plays at Stratford-upon-Avon, and later at the Aldwych in London, in 1973, Williamson gave a coruscating performance as an unusually virulent and misanthropic Coriolanus. He returned to the Memorial theatre, Stratford, in 1974 as a sour-faced, vinegary Malvolio in Twelfth Night and a wolverine, prowling Macbeth. The following year Nunn took that production (Helen Mirren was Lady Macbeth) to London, but cut out the gothic excess in a\u00a0journey with the play that took him to\u00a0the defining chamber version of it at the Other Place, Stratford, in 1976 with Ian McKellen and\u00a0Judi\u00a0Dench. Williamson was never as much a\u00a0part of the RSC as some of his leading contemporaries, but he did &quot;muck in&quot; with a small-scale production of\u00a0Chekhov&apos;s Uncle Vanya at the Other Place, with his wife, Jill Townsend, in\u00a01975. He had married Townsend when\u00a0she appeared as his daughter in the Broadway production of\u00a0Inadmissible Evidence (they divorced in 1977). His best-known film roles included Sherlock Holmes in The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976, in which Watson, played\u00a0by Robert Duvall, persuades Holmes to\u00a0visit Sigmund Freud, played by Alan Arkin); and Merlin in John Boorman&apos;s Excalibur (1981, with Nigel Terry as Arthur and Helen Mirren as Morgana). &quot;I enjoyed playing Merlin,&quot; Williamson told the Los Angeles Times. &quot;I tried to make him a cross between my old English master and a space traveller, with a bit of Grand Guignol thrown in.&quot; He had lived mostly in Amsterdam since 1970, but could sometimes be seen in various north London pubs, where he was quite happy to mind his own business and leave the pursuit of glamour and glory to other, less deserving performers. No one who saw him on stage will ever forget him, but it is difficult to see his career as anything but unfulfilled. He is survived by his son, Luke. Jack Gold writes: Friends made me fearful when they heard I was making my first feature film, The Bofors Gun, with Nicol Williamson. He had a\u00a0reputation of a dangerous disposition combined with a staggering talent. The part of a near-psychotic squaddie was written by John McGrath with Nicol in mind. My fears were groundless. He was totally professional, exacting, volatile and provocative in his work, both with myself and with tremendous actors including David Warner, Ian Holm and John Thaw. His performance was justifiably acclaimed. We worked together several more times, each one with a mixture of\u00a0excitement and not a little trepidation on my part: The Reckoning in 1969 (he\u00a0was Michael Marler, a protagonist red in tooth and claw from working-class Liverpool, succeeding in the City and Berkshire), The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, aka The Gangster Show (Brecht&apos;s comic, sinister take on Hitler), Macbeth (for the BBC, 1983) and Richard Nixon in a David Edgar version of the Watergate tapes, I Know What I Meant (1974); all strong, often dangerous, unlikeable characters. Nicol never kowtowed to an audience or tried to charm them. Film crews adored him for his understanding and respect for their craft. He worked as strongly with other actors when he was off-camera as when on. His comic improvisations of the people around him were brilliant and often uncomfortable. He liked &quot;stirring&quot;; at\u00a0the end of filming The Reckoning, we\u00a0presented him with a 6ft wooden spoon. Directing him was a constantly surprising process. He was quick to understand even a hint of a suggestion. There were rapid and subtle changes of expression, his antennae as finely tuned as his performances. He liked the challenges, the technicalities, the rigours of filming (Barry Jackson remembers Nicol filming repeated takes stripped to the waist during a\u00a0freezing night shoot), but if ever there was a\u00a0piano handy, he was immediately seated there, singing ballads, blues, rock, jazz. He loved the great musicians and improvisation. I think that, latterly, that is where his heart truly lay. \u2022 Nicol Williamson, actor, born 14 September 1938; died 16 December 2011 \u2022 This article was amended on 27 January.

Trevor Nunn&apos;s production of Macbeth for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1974 was initially staged in Stratford, not London, and at the Memorial theatre rather than the Other Place.

Beijing 2008 saw computer faked footprint-shaped fireworks trek across the sky from Tiananmen Square to the Bird&apos;s Nest stadium, and a seven-year-old singer&apos;s vocals mimed by a more aesthetically-pleasing girl. In 1984, not content with sending torch-bearer Rafer Johnson up the longest, steepest staircase imaginable and having an Evel Knievel lookalike in a jetpack buzz the crowd, the LA games organisers decided for the closing ceremony that nothing embodied the Olympic spirit quite as potently as a big alien in a flying saucer. Hitler&apos;s ambitious plans for the 1936 Berlin Olympics \u2013 complete with Leni Riefenstahl&apos;s famous film of the games \u2013 were heroically undermined by Jesse Owens&apos; victories. However, the games did produce one major legacy: the torch relay. Less tradition-setting were the Austrian and French teams&apos; Nazi salutes at the Berlin ceremony, though some French athletes later claimed they were giving the not wholly dissimilar Olympic salute. Eight years earlier, the Amsterdam games kicked off with a spectacle involving pigeons, artillery fire and the Olympic flame being lit for the first time. Sadly, Queen Wilhelmina missed the extravaganza. Either furious at the organisers&apos; failure to consult her or disapproving of the fact it was held on a Sunday, she became the first host head of state not to attend the opening ceremony, remaining in the isolated splendour of her Norwegian holiday retreat.Doubtless much to the relief of the planning committee, the Queen managed to overcome her umbrage, or principles, in time to make the closing ceremony, also on a Sunday. But if it&apos;s a masterclass in feelgood internationalism that Boyle seeks, he may wish to look all the way back to the 1896 Athens games: 80,000 people joined the Greek royal family at the Panathinaiko stadium to usher in the first modern Olympics, where the Danish-born King George (watched by his Russian wife Olga) patriotically declared: &quot;Long live the nation. Long live the Greek people.&quot; The ceremony clearly met with the approval of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics. Watching the crowds stream into the stadium, he was delighted to witness the &quot;joyous and motley concourse&quot;.", "sentences": ["Eight years earlier, the Amsterdam games kicked off with a spectacle involving pigeons, artillery fire and the Olympic flame being lit for the first time."], "title": "Can London 2012's opening ceremony beat its predecessors?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/27/past-olympic-games-opening-ceremonies", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Danny Boyle", "Sport", "UK news", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-28T12:16:00Z", "article": " Morning. It was Smyth&apos;s birthday last night so the least popular member of the sport de... the hardest working member of the sport desk was nominated to remain sober, go top bed early, wakes up early and sub for him on the OBO. I can honestly say going to a social event with my colleagues sober was one of the worst experiences of my life \u2013 even worse than working with my colleagues sober \u2013 and I was quite glad to slip away. Incidentally, I dreamed I was getting KP to guess people&apos;s middle names. He even knew Emile Heskey&apos;s is Ivanhoe. I woke up as we got to Ian Bell. It&apos;s R for Ruthless, KP.  The start of today&apos;s play will be crucial. A quick couple of wickets and we&apos;re into Pakistan&apos;s lucious long tail and England could have a chase of 100-150 or so. A target of over 200 will be very tricky for England though.  Tom Peach&apos;s email was waiting for me when I got into the office: &quot;Was very unhappy the Indians were sent packing in only one hour this morning. Sachin &amp; Bradman both defined by the number 99. I would think any target over 200 will have England jittery today,&quot; he writes from Sydney. &quot;That said the Ashes next year is already looking feisty (too early to be thinking Ashes?)&quot; 5.30am on a Saturday morning is too early to think of  anything.  In three days I am flying out to Chile for three weeks, which is lovely. But the journey is 24 hours, which is terrible. Mainly because it takes about five minutes on the bus before my friend and I start to quarrel. A few years ago we went to Vietnam and had a fistfight just before takeoff about who had the window seat (it said window seat on my ticket, the injustice still burns) before we realised we were about to be shot by air marshalls. So today&apos;s riff can be Terrible Journeys Of My Time.  Here&apos;s Patrick Murphy: &quot;Foggy in Abu Dhabi this am Tom. Any word on the start time?&quot; Ah, that Abu Dhabi fog. We&apos;re due to start on time, as far as I&apos;m aware. Stuart Broad has just been on the telly, and he reckons England would be happy to chase anything up to 250. Dave Langlois doesn&apos;t agree with him though: &quot;Jittery with 200? Much less. I&apos;m really quite amazed that most pundits are giving England as favourites in this situation. With their fragility and pusillanimity against this excellent spin attack they&apos;d be pushed in last innings to get any more than a ton, 120 at most.&quot;  Mike Selvey is on hand to give actual analysis rather than my wittering: &quot;If Abu Dhabi were Hove or Scarborough (and the surrounding areas look a bit like that if you imagine the tide a long long way out), us bowlers would be rubbing our hands right now. First thing, you could not see beyond the wall of the hotel garden and on to the golf course next door and the mist still hangs low over the ground.  &quot;It is damp and when the new ball comes around in nineteen overs time, it ought to hoop around. By then, England will hope that the spinners have made further inroads, (although it might be worth giving Jimmy a crackfirst up). &quot;Meanwhile young Copley, Getty&apos;s ace snapper has been instructed to go into the surrounding wastelands and take some atmospheric pictures of the ground. Look forward to seeing those taken through the gloom.&quot; I&apos;ve already got Photoshop open to crop a few of those when they come through on the wires.  62nd over: Pakistan 126-4 (lead by 55; Azhar 47, Shafiq 35) Swann starts and Azhar picks up a single from the first ball of the day. Shafiq has a bit of a whizz near the end of the over that was a risky shot for the first over of the day but he survives. It&apos;s his 26th birthday today by the way.  63rd over: Pakistan 127-4 (Azhar 48, Shafiq 35) Mike Selvey suggested England might try Jimmy early on as the fog rolls in but they&apos;ve gone for Broad instead. His first ball is nudged away to mid-on. Shafiq sees off the rest of the over fairly easily. &quot;Worst journey ever?&quot; asks Andy Lindon. &quot;To Leicester. It doesn&apos;t matter where from. Just to Leicester.&quot;  64th over: Pakistan 129-4 (Azhar 50, Shafiq 35) Azhar brings up his 50 with a tuckaway to square leg, the half-century came off 143 balls. He then gives Cook, at short leg, a quarter-chance but it went very quickly and he didn&apos;t have reasonable time to react.  65th over: Pakistan 129-4 (Azhar 50, Shafiq 35)Shafiq is content to block away at Broad. He has a drive at the third ball of the over but KP dives to save the runs. A maiden for Broad. &quot;I didn&apos;t drink either last night- despite best attempts of work colleagues,&quot; says James Gordon. &quot;On such sacrifices are sporting triumphs built. England to wrap up the win sometime after tea. Thanks to me and you.&quot; How often to people hold up gin and make jokes about Gordon&apos;s gin to you? Once already today, I suppose.  66th over: Pakistan 130-4 (leads by 60; Azhar 51, Shafiq 35) Panesar is on for Swann. He beats Shafiq all ends up with a lovely delivery but it misses the edge. Trott&apos;s off feeling a bit poorly so Finn is fielding in his place. Lord Selve has some advice for Andy Lindon: &quot;Take the positives from the Leicester experience,&quot; he says, I imagine tapping a pipe and looking wise. &quot;It follows that the best journey in the world must be from Leicester.&quot;  67th over: Pakistan 132-4 (lead by 62; Azhar 53, Shafiq 35) Broad beats Azhar with a ball that pitches just outside off and moves away slightly \u2013 England miss the edge again. On Sky Naser Hussain reckons, Pakistan should try scoring some actual runs, while they can. Azhar gets a couple down to deep square leg to finish the over.  68th over: Pakistan 136-4 (lead by 66; Azhar 53, Shafiq 39)Monty has a shout for lbw but it was probably just missing leg stump. England, correctly, don&apos;t go for the review. Shafiq then has a biff at a loose ball to score the first boundary of the day. &quot;Not been that bad,&quot; says Tom Carver, &quot;but I&apos;m in the middle of a journey that has so far involved three boats, then a bus, two rickshaws, another bus, an aeroplane, a taxi, another three ferries and will end in a taxi. That is what is involved in getting from Malapascua island in the Philippines to Guangzhou, China. And the joy of modern tech is that I can follow the cricket all the way.&quot;  69th over: Pakistan 141-4 (lead by 71; Azhar 54, Shafiq 43) Azhar pushes a single to leg for the first ball of the over. He gets better too: a lovely four off a full delivery ends the over. &quot;Big night on tour last night,&quot; trumpets Mike Selvey. &quot;Pot of tea in room, rerun of Thelma and Louise on one of the OSN movie channels, the arse end of an early Harry Potter and The Golden Franchise, Times crossword, and sleep. We know how to live I can tell you.&quot; That&apos;s till more rock and roll than two waters and a shoulder massage from Smyth.  WICKET! Pakistan 142-5 (Shafiq c Andeson b Panesar 43) Just as I was typing that Pakistan were looking relatively comfortable, Monty gets one to turn and Jimmy takes a brilliant catch at slip. Very sharp reactions there.  71st over: Pakistan 143-5 (lead by 73; Azhar 56, Akmal 0) Swann&apos;s back on. Big shout for a catch off Akmal after the ball flies to Cook at short leg but it came off the batsman&apos;s pad. &quot;On the plus side you don&apos;t have the beer fear this morning,&quot; says Niall Mullen. &quot;On the down side you&apos;ve now realised the impossibility of social interaction without alcohol and the idiocy of social interaction with it.&quot;  72nd over: Pakistan 143-5 (lead by 73; Azhar 56, Akmal 0) Maiden from Monty. &quot;I just walked for about two miles to visit Billingsgate market,&quot; says rdemslie &quot;It was the end of a strange and rambling drunken evening. Fish smell wasn&apos;t particularly useful for the ol&apos; belly.&quot; Why were you going to a fish market at that time of evening, you&apos;re supposed to go to a meat market. Everyone knows that.  73rd over: Pakistan 147-5 (lead by 77; Azhar 56, Akmal 4) Akmal is feeling peppy after a slow start and picks four off the first couple of balls of Swann&apos;s over. He makes Monty chase for them too, a cunning tactic to tire out the opposing spinners. &quot;I once persuaded Jim Maxwell, top ABC cricket commentator, that rather than go on the motorway via Leeds, we should travel to Durham via M6 and then across the Pennines via the spectacular A686 from Penrith to Corbridge in Northumberland, and recently voted as one of the great drives in the world,&quot; says Mike Selvey on our worst journeys riff. &quot;It pissed down, you could touch the cloud base, and the most spectacular part was driven in thick mist. Maxwell did not think much of it.&quot; You should have taken him to Leicester.  74th over: Pakistan 147-5 (lead by 77; Azhar 56, Akmal 4) Monty beats Azhar with a lovely dipping ball but it misses the edge. Monty holds his hands to his head in frustration. An excellent maiden.  75th over: Pakistan 149-5 (lead by 79; Azhar 57, Akmal 5) Akmal attempts the reverse sweep and it nearly plops to Bell, who&apos;s fielding at silly point. He sees the funny side though. As do England. Strauss has trotted off the field for a comfort break.  76th over: Pakistan 150-5 (lead by 80; Azhar 58, Akmal 5) Azhar nudges a single but Pakistan are treating Monty with caution. &quot;An Edinburgh to London all-nighter on National Express,&quot; says James Stevenson. You can always trust National Express for a nightmare journey story. Although I should point out they offer an economical travel option for the British people before their lawyers get involves. &quot;My then girlfriend and I both had a nasty bout of food poisoning and took it in turns monopolising the loo - to the chagrin of our fellow passengers. Truly miserable. By the way, did Hadley Freeman show up last night? I can only assume successive days of OBO dominated by fashion-related riffs were an attempt to encourage her to attend and sprinkle some much-needed glamour on proceedings.&quot; Haldey Freeman was not present. She would have been delighted at some of the fashion though.  77th over: Pakistan 158-5 (lead by 88; Azhar 65, Akmal 6) Azhar gets an edge that runs past the slips to third man for three. The ball is then swept for four. Pakistan are definfitely more comfortable against Swann than Panesar. Bell goes down to leg slip to prevent such nonsense. &quot;The worst journey ever are surely those ones that sang that off Glee,&quot; says Rich Kavanagh.  78th over: Pakistan 160-5 (lead by 90; Azhar 65, Akmal 8) Jimmy dashes across from slip to cut off an Akmal sweep, he was off before the ball was hit. I&apos;d started to give him four for that. Excellent fielding.  REVIEW!! Swann could have an lbw here. Davis raises the finger but it looked like it was missing. Hawkeye shows the ball was turning enough to slide past leg. Steve Davis looks quite miffed by the whole thing, more so than England.  79th over: Pakistan 162-5 (lead by 92; Azhar 66, Akmal 8) Pakistan see out the rest of the over but that&apos;s the first time Swann has looked dangerous this morning. Enouraging for him and England. That&apos;s drinks.  80th over: Pakistan 165-5 (lead by 95; Azhar 66, Akmal 11) Last over before the new ball is due and Monty trundles in again. The second ball of the over goes just wide of second slip. Monty then beats the edge again to end the over. I should probably tell you my National Express story, following on from James Stevenson in the 76th over. I had some &quot;valium&quot; which I&apos;d purchased in Vietnam and, faced with a journey on National Express, took one at the start of the journey. The next thing I knew it was three hours later and I was being shaken awake by the old lady next to me. I had trapped her in the window seat for the last few hours, while she was trying to get to the toilet. I threw the offending tablets away soon afterwards. Her pained face still haunts my dreams.  81st over: Pakistan 167-5 (lead by 97; Azhar 66, Akmal 13) England have taken the ball at the first opportunity and Jimmy Anderson will have his first bowl of the day. The sun&apos;s come out and the fog is burning off. Akmal gets a couple off the final ball of the over. &quot;Also an overnight train trip, but mine was from Armidale to Sydney [13 hours; can be driven in seven] on the mail train,&quot; says Sarah Jane Bacon. &quot;Wooden seats with a suggestion of vinyl for comfort, no dining car, sputtering lights, the deafening clatter of the wheels, open windows belching smoke and -5C breeze, and every torturous minute spent in the company of drunken university students drenched in the miasma of rum and vomit. Never again. Ever. I took the plane home thereafter and even now, I cope less than well in trains.&quot; Ah, rum and vomit, the smell of all good train journeys.  82nd over: Pakistan 168-5 (lead by 98; Azhar 66, Akmal 13) Broad will partner Anderson with the new ball. This is an OBOer&apos;s dream after two spinners, there&apos;s so much time I feel like I could write a novel. If I had an idea. And could write. Azhar has a think about a prod at a wide-ish ball from Broad but he takes his bat away  WICKET! Pakistan 170-6 (Azhar 68 c Prior b Anderson)  A huge wicket as Jimmy removes Azhar who had hung around since approximately 1862. The new ball worked well, the delivery roared up at Azhar who tried to prod it away but it caught the top of the bat and Prior clung on.  83rd over: Pakistan 172-6 (lead by 102; Rehman 2, Akmal 13)&quot;Tuning in to the Monty-Broad show and reading of food poisoning on the National Express, I thought instantly of a Chilean coach, which I discover was the source of the thread,&quot; says Liam Drew. &quot;Chile is long and thin, coach rides can be likewise long. Mine was 19 hours and my diarrhea started an hour in. After a third lengthy trip to the back of the vehicle, the conductor ranted at my gringo face for at least 5 minutes. At the end, my Chilean then-girlfriend translated it as &apos;Stop shitting. Everybody on the bus hates you.&apos; To which, I could only meekly reply, &apos;But I can&apos;t.&apos;&quot; A riposte for the ages. That&apos;s why I am staying in the Santiago Airport Hilton for my three weeks, venturing out only for walks around the car park.  WICKET! Pakistan 172-7 (Akmal 13 c Strauss b Broad)Wonderful fielding from KP. Akmal looks like he&apos;s got a four with a ball that flies to cover but KP smothers it to save the runs. Akmal looks like he&apos;s ready to let fly now: expect a swashbuckling 48, or a wicket in the next few overs .. oh hang on. Make that next delivery. He slashes at it and the ball flies to Strauss at slip. We&apos;re into Pakistan&apos;s tail now.  85th over Pakistan 177-7 (lead by 107; Rehman 3, Ajmal 4) England will be happy, seeing as some of Pakistan&apos;s tail actually average minus runs at Test level. Still, if they can get up to a lead of 160 or so they have a chance. &quot;With news of a stomach bug in the England camp, I think the radio commentary team&apos;s use of the phrase &apos;Broad is loosening up at mid on&apos; could have been chosen a little more carefully,&quot; says James Hobbs.  86th over Pakistan 179-7 (lead by 109; Rehman 3, Ajmal 4) A couple of leg byes to start the over. Broad then has a shout for lbw. He wants it reviered but Strauss reckons it was too high. Hawkeye backs him up too. &quot;Some years back I travelled up to Keswick to meet my wife to be as she drove back from Scotland,&quot; says romance&apos;s Phil Withall. &quot;The bright red 2CV she and her friend had was rickerty to say the least. I had to squeeze my six foot plus body into the back with the luggage and was then battered by gale force winds and driving rain. Had to hold the window shut and the roof of the car down. Every time a lorry went by I honestly thought I would be sucked out of the car and under its wheels. I still can&apos;t look a a French car without sobbing.&quot;  REVIEW!!! The appeals are coming thick and fast now. Jimmy raises his hands but again the it was just going over the stumps. Pakistan scramble for a single in the ensuing confusion. A few balls later he has another shout and Strauss goes for the review this time. It was only clipping leg though so Davis&apos;s decision isn&apos;t overturned. England have no reviews left.  87th over Pakistan 180-7 (lead by 110; Rehman 3, Ajmal 4) Pakistan survive the rest of the over.  88th over Pakistan 183-7 (lead by 113; Rehman 3, Ajmal 7) Good fielding from Jimmy, who cuts off what looks like a certain boundary. The batsmen are looking ever so slightly more comfortable now. &quot;I once did Adelaide to Perth on the Indian Pacific train. 36 hours. Not a lot of fun,&quot; says Mike Selvey. 400 miles of dead straight track across the Nullabor and a single stop, at Cook, like a frontier town in the Wild West (localhospital advertising hoarding as the train approached the station read &apos;If You Feel Crook, Come To Cook&apos;: eat your hearts out Madison Avenue), catering of the lowest order (chewy steak, tinned carrots and tinned spuds and a bar that shut when the meal was finished because &apos;I&apos;m off to have mine now, mate&apos;,) and then, much much later, another stop at Kalgoorlie, in the middle of the night, to be taken on a bus ride round the red light district and be waved at cheerily by the local hookers.&quot; I was once ID&apos;s in the middle of the Nullarbor despite the fact that the nearest policeman was 200 miles away. Still admirable jobsworthing.  89th over Pakistan 187-7 (lead by 117; Rehman 6, Ajmal 8) Swann&apos;s back on for Jimmy Anderson. England are surrounding the bat now with a silly point and short leg. Rehman has a heave over mid on and it drops safe.  90th over Pakistan 190-7 (lead by 120; Rehman 8, Ajmal 8) Monty&apos;s on for Broad. Rehman cracks a couple through mid-wicket. A single to end the over and Pakistan&apos;s lead creeps towards 150.  91st over Pakistan 194-7 (lead by 124; Rehman 10, Ajmal 11) Cook, at short leg, gets a nasty crack on the knee from Rehman&apos;s sweep. The knee pads absorbed most of the blow but he&apos;s gritting his teeth in discomfort. Swann finds the outside edge near the end of over but it squirts clear of danger.  92nd over Pakistan 198-7 (lead by 128; Rehman 10, Ajmal 11) The ball flies through the slips but Ajmal hadn&apos;t touched it. Neither did the England fielders and that&apos;s four. A big shout for lbw at the end of the over but it&apos;s turned down. England haven&apos;t got a review left. It looked like there was the smallest of inside edges anyway. &quot;Reading the OBO, sky&apos;s playing the coverage on my laptop and I&apos;m listening to TMS,&quot; saysRalph Taylor. &quot;Total cricketing submersion. As soon as they have a drinks break I&apos;m going to go and get into my whites and spikes. Then I&apos;m going to become single very quickly when the wife wakes up...&quot; You could just have had an affair like normal people do.  LUNCH England had a fillip when the new ball was taken with two quick wickets but Pakistan have put a nice partnership together towards the end of the session. England&apos;s morning .. just.  93rd over Swann gets things started for England and we have a review...  WICKET!!!!! Pakistan 198-8 (Rehman lbw b Swann 10) Rehman was a long way down, so he referred it but review showed it would have clipped leg so the umpire&apos;s decision stands.  94th over Pakistan 198-8 (lead by 128; Ajmal 11, Gul 0) Monty is back on and looking to secure his five-for. That last partnership was useful for Pakistan getting them close to a target they can defend but England are very much in control now. &quot;My wife has returned from work and I proudly showed her my comment (86th over),&quot; says Phil Withall. &quot;Expecting, at the very least, a &apos;well done dear&apos; you can imagine my disappointment when all I got was a dismissive &apos;Humph, &quot;romances Phil Withall&quot;?. My planned evening of cricket, red wine and toe nail picking has now been abandoned in favour of a bad movie and providing foot rubs. Thank you sooooo much Mr Lutz, thank you...&quot;  95th over Pakistan 199-8 (lead by 129; Ajmal 11, Gul 1) Gul gets an edge but it runs safe. They then think they have an inside edge which carries to short leg but replays show it was off the pads. &quot;The sad, (but actually boastful), stories about crossing Australia/Chile by bus, train or\u00a0mule miss the point,&quot; says John Culley. &quot;Long journeys may be pants, but all I have to look forward to this fine Saturday, apart from Guardian OBO,\u00a0is the three and half miles to the vets with an incontinent and terrified cat on board, knowing that for the rest of 2012 my wife will be saying, &apos;The cars still still got that strange smell - can you clean it again&apos;.&quot;  96th over Pakistan 199-8 (lead by 129; Ajmal 11, Gul 1) Gul&apos;s single off the last ball of the previous over puts him on strike. Nasser reminds us Gul&apos;s highest Test score is 65 - against England. He elects not to take an easy single though \u2013 maybe he wants to get his 66 in boundaries. &quot;My worst journey was probably a 24 hour coach journey from Les Arcs in France back to Blighty,&quot; says John Tumbridge. &quot;First few hours went &apos;fine&apos; the two French coach drivers swapping drivers whilst driving down the motorway at about 70 miles an hour. We then stopped at a roadside establishment where us plucky Brits consumed yogurts, museli, orange juice, as it was three in the morning and watched astonished as the drivers between them consumed two large horse steaks and lots of wine.  &quot;The journey recommenced and we then used both lanes of the motorway as the chosen driver, \u00a0with wine inside, swayed between the two lanes with all of the control of a two year old in a buggy. 48 passengers gripping onto their arm rests, leaving their fingerprints pernamently embedded on the fabric. Being British we said nothing.&quot; I bet he got you home faster than he would have done sober though.&quot;  97th over Pakistan 205-8 (lead by 135; Ajmal 17, Gul 1) Dropped! Dropped? No. The ball pops up from Ajmal and Bell juggles the ball but it was off his pads, much to his relief. Monty then just about stops a boundary doing some juggling of his own at deep square leg. Ajmal does get a boundary with the final ball of the over though.  WICKET!!!! Pakistan 208-9 (Ajmal c Anderson b Panesar 17)  Monty has his five-for! Ajmal had started to look like he&apos;s be an awkward obstacle for England but Monty gets some extra bounce and turn, and Anderson takes an easy catch.  99th over Pakistan 214-9 (lead by 144; Gul 10, Junaid Khan 0) Broad&apos;s on to put the frighteners on the tailenders. We may see some shots from Gul here who looks like he&apos;s going to go down swinging. That said he disappoints us all by leaving the first few balls of the over. Then he cracks the third for six. It lands somewhere in the desert. &quot;Monty Panesar justifies his Beard of Winter 2012 Award as he takes 5 wickets in Pakistan 2nd Innings,&quot; says Beard Liberation Front. Maybe Gul should grow one \u2013 I quite enjoyed that thwack.  WICKET!!! Pakistan 214 all out (Junaid Khan 0 b Panesar)  Khan decides to slog like Gul but only succeeds at slogging thin air and the ball rips into the stumps. Excellent stuff from Monty, who takes 6-66.  So England have a day and a half to make 145 to level the series. The decision to bring in two spinners looks like a good one, although it was Monty rather than the established Swann who ran through Pakistan. &quot;Do non-journeys count,&quot; asks Robin Hazlehurst of our worst journeys riff. &quot;I went to Bristol last year for a meeting and figured that by taking the 6am flight home I&apos;d be back at work by lunchtime the next day.  &quot;But as there was an evening social event and a very early flight, there was no point in bothering with a hotel, I&apos;d just stay in a pub until they closed then grab two hours kip at the airport before the flight. Which sort of worked, except that in the morning the aeroplane was broken and the flight cancelled, so instead of a comfy hotel bed and afternoon flight I spent a day hanging around Bristol, Amsterdam and Copenhagen airports with no sleep smelling a bit funny. And to make it worse they put me in business class on the last leg, which was full while the cheap seats were almost empty. And I didn&apos;t make it to work that afternoon.&quot; Yeah, I hate it when you get a free upgrade to business class. They could at least have made it first.  The target of 145 is no gimme. England have a few out of form batsmen and memories of the capitulations in the last Test are still fresh \u2013 for both teams.  &quot;How about this for a worst journey,&quot; begins Phil Keegan. &quot;In 1989, I took a 14 hour coach trip from Adana in southern Turkey to Istanbul. An old lady in the seat directly behind me spent the entire 14 hours throwing up due to motion sickness. When she had nothing left inside she continued to violently retch, cough and splutter. What&apos;s more, I was suffering from a crushing hangover myself and my body was quite keen to join in the puking. I had a half bottle of Red Label hidden in my jacket pocket, and sipping on that and having my Walkman blasting into my ears just about kept me alive. Overall though, I think the old lady might just win the worst journey award.&quot; I was more struck by the Walkman reference. Is that like an iPod? Also, the moral of these stories is that you should never ever go near a coach.  1st over England 1-0 (Target 145; Strauss 1, Cook 0) Hafeez will open the bowling for Pakistan. Right, at 10-an-over this should be over in time for tea. In Strauss&apos;s defence, he has only failed to get out of single figures once this series. Hafeez has an average of around 22 against left-handers, by the way.  2nd over England 3-0 (Target 145; Strauss 2, Cook 1) Gul comes in from the other end and gets a bit of swing while he&apos;s at it too. Nothing to trouble the batsmen though ... yet. &quot;I can trump all your worst journeys, I took a bnoat trip and was eaten by a whale. A WHALE! To be fair, I got quite a bit of coverage out if it,&quot; writes someone claiming to be Jonah out of the Bible. &apos;Jonah&apos; undermines his claims by failing to write in Aramaic.  3rd over England 6-0 (Target 145; Strauss 3, Cook 3) England keep things ticking over. Bell looks like he&apos;s padded up to come in at No3: Trott is ill.  4th over England 8-0 (Target 145; Strauss 4, Cook 4) Lovelt ball from Gul that tucks Cook up. He could easily have got a nick on that. Hey! I thought early scares were Strauss&apos;s job. Meanwhile, we may have a winner for worst journey. Here&apos;s Arthur Seeley: &quot;While working for VSO in the Solomon Islands I was stranded in Munda for three days waiting for a seat on a plane. Each that arrived was full. I was eating quietly in a small motel close to the airport when one of their staff came over and said there was a special flight and a spare seat. The special flight I discovered was to fly a dead lady back to her native village. I was given the co-pilot&apos;s seat and her corpse in a black plastic bag was laid across the seats behind me . The other seats were occupied by grieving relatives quietly sobbing.  &quot;The journey was only twenty minutes but it was raining heavily and we could not find our landing strip of grass. The pilot asked me to slide my window open and see if I could see anything. The rain lashed my body and turbulence moved the corpse closer to me until her feet were in my back.  &quot;The weather cleared and there was the field below us but were too high so the plot pushed the nose down and the lady slipped further forward pinning me against the front window. I was shaking as we landed and I had to go off somewhere and stand quietly. Playing footsie with a corpse is not recommended.Thats one I would like to forget but can&apos;t.&quot;  5th over England 11-0 (Target 145; Strauss 5, Cook 6) England look comfortable and work Hafeez round the pitch. &quot;The only reason I was not at Rob Smyth&apos;s birthday last night is because I was NFI, and thanks very much for rubbing that in, Tom,&quot; writes Hadley Freeman. &quot;But considering I once had a conversation with the birthday boy about the acceptability (or otherwise) of dungarees on a grown man, I have no doubt at all I would have been very impressed indeed by the fashions at this party (to which I was not invited) being pushed, worked and, indeed, owned.&quot; Most people would consider not being invited to Smyth&apos;s birthday a bonus. You could have stood in a field on your own all night and still had a better host.  6th over England 12-0 (Target 145; Strauss 6, Cook 6)Strauss guides the ball down to third man for a single. If England do win this, it&apos;ll show they&apos;re incapable of playing two bad Tests in a row at the moment. &quot;I spent 10 hours phenomenally hungover in a little Toyota minivan on the Kazakh steppe, going to the Kazakh national oil company Bond villain-like lair in the mountains north of Astana,&quot; says Paddy Blewer, impressing us a little bit. &quot;Two things really stand out. The steppe Does. Not. Change. You lose any sense of place and time. Also they had the russian version of Little Britain on the van&apos;s dvd player. &apos;Nasha Russia&apos;. Similar jokes, but more brutal in a particulay brutal Russian way...&quot; You got a DVD player? That&apos;s an excellent journey.  7th over England 12-0 (Target 145; Strauss 6, Cook 6) A maiden for Hafeez but no threat to speak of. Sky tell us that England have only lost once in the last 100 years while chasing fewer than 150 runs. &quot;I once took the Greyhound from Boston to San Francisco,&quot; says Jamie Kirkaldy. &quot;Naively believing American bus services would be the definition of comfort and convenience, I expected to be sat in air conditioning watching films all the way. The reality: four days staring out of a window with only a Walkman, three tapes and a book I finished on the first morning for company. On day three, some hick spent four hours trying to convince me to join the circus with him.&quot; I should point out Jamie recently won California Lion Tamer of the Year.  8th over England 12-0 (Target 145; Strauss 6, Cook 6)  Right. Ajmal is on. This is where things could get tricky for England. Cook fends off the first few balls. I&apos;m guessing we may see more of that. Pakistan have a think about a review for lbw but it was sliding down leg and they let things be.  9th over England 13-0 (Target 145; Strauss 7, Cook 6)  Hawkeye says that lbw shout in the last over was indeed missing. Strauss is on all sorts of trouble as Hafeez&apos;s delivery misses the outside edge. There&apos;s a noise but it was bat hitting pad. Rather impressively, seeing as England were scoring at 0.00004 an over, Pakistan have slowed England down.  10th over England 14-0 (Target 145; Strauss 8, Cook 6)  Strauss gets a single, playing across the line. He gets away with it though and Ajmal concedes his first run. &quot;There&apos;s that Walkman again,&quot; says Rich Sharland, &quot;is that like a dansette but newer, somehow portable? It doesn&apos;t sound so funky...&quot; I want one, whatever it is.  11th over England 14-0 (Target 145; Strauss 8, Cook 6) Strauss rocks back and attempts to crack it through cover but it&apos;s straight to a fielder. No need for England to rush, I reckon they&apos;ve still got just enough time with a day and a bit to go. Maiden.  12th over England 14-0 (Target 145; Strauss 8, Cook 6)  The run rate for the last six overs is, seriously, 0.35 an over. Cook bats out a maiden. Here&apos;s Mac Millings On Travel: &quot;This story has come up before, and doesn&apos;t bear repeating, but here it is anyway. Many years ago, I was on a train in China during Spring Festival (around Chinese New Year), a time when it seems that everyone in the country is on the move. The train was packed, and, just when you thought no one else could get on, we&apos;d pull in at a station and more people would climb in through the windows, after first handing up baggage and children. It was fun for me until the food poisoning I&apos;d unknowingly contracted eating dodgy train station food kicked in.  &quot;I struggled over the mass of humanity to the toilet (a little room with a hole open to the tracks below as they chugged past), to find 3 people asleep in it. So I hiked back to my seat (held for me by my wife). As time went by, I kept getting worse. I tried to hold it in, really I did. First, I threw up out of the window.  &quot;Then I took out my travel-convenient lunch pail, lowered my trousers and, in front of 100s of surprisingly nonchalant fellow passengers, emptied my bowels into it. I still have the lunch pail, by the way; and yes, I have since eaten out of it.&quot; Ha! So it was you that woke me up from my sleep in the toilet.  13th over England 14-0 (Target 145; Strauss 8, Cook 6)  I thought that was a run for a minute but Strauss&apos;s push to mid off is gathered. England are actually playing this sensibly, not taking any risks but one run would be nice. Is that too much to ask?  14th over England 18-0 (Target 145; Strauss 10, Cook 7)  Strauss launches a volley of sixes. Or maybe he gets a single. Small steps though. We end up with four off the over! Whoop! &quot;This innings is turning into an arduous journey,&quot; says Seth Ennis, correctly.  WICKET! England 21-1 (Cook 7 c &amp;b Hafeez) &quot;At that run rate it will take 414.2 overs to get 145 runs. I&apos;m putting my mortgage on a draw,&quot; says Niall Mullen auditioning for the numbers round on Countdown. Hold on to your horses, Niall, Strauss just got a three, snicked behind three. Cook then goes to Hafeez. Early problems for England. Cook was getting impatient - unlike him - and the shot was rash. It took the leading edge and Hafeez&apos;s return catch was a good one.  16th over England 23-1 (Target 145; Strauss 16, Bell 0)  Bell is in at No2 because Trott is ill. Not in the dope sense more in the sense of some of the stories we&apos;ve been reading about on this OBO. Strauss gets a couple down to third man.  17th over England 26-1 (Target 145; Strauss 16, Bell 3)  Rehman replaces Hafeez and Bell attacks him from the off. He drives down to deep midwicket for three. Pakistan have a shout for a catch as Strauss fends to short leg. Replays are inconclusive and the benefit of the doubt goes to Strauss. I didn&apos;t think it carried. &quot;From a litany of bleakness, two terrible journeys stand out for me,&quot; says Guy Hornsby. &quot;14 hours overnight from Brisbane to Townsville by coach was a highlight. My reserved seat had me sat next to a drunk, ahem, portly woman with a cast on one arm that took up 1.3 seats. I slept for 2 hours. Also up there was flying Sydney to London the wrong way. Apart from numerous US airport security staff that&apos;d make the Gestapo seem amiable, my journey included an extra stop in LA, the worst food I&apos;ve ever tasted and being thrown out of duty free in Newark (a shed of a terminal) because transit passengers &apos;are not allowed to browse&apos;. NEVER again.&quot;  WICKET!!!!! England 26-2 (Bell 3 b Ajmal)  Bell is bowled through his legs, the ball rolling agonisingly on to his stumps after he&apos;d fended it down to, what he thought, was safety. The collapse is on!  18th over England 28-2 (Target 145; Strauss 17, Pieteresen 1)  KP gets off the mark with a quick single off his first ball. He looks relieved and so he should considering the pressure Pakistan are putting them under. The tension shows as England mix themselves up and Pietersen has to scramble back to avoid the run out.  19th over England 29-2 (Target 145; Strauss 17, Pieteresen 1)  Pakistan are having a good old chatter around the bat now. England can&apos;t get runs away to relieve the pressure. Rehman slides one past Strauss and he just misses the stumps. &quot;Since Ms Freeman is gracing the obo these days I wonder if I could Ask Hadley what is the best outfit for me to wear while reading the obo and watching the cricket,&quot; says Niall Mullen. &quot;I&apos;m currently wearing underpants (by Next) and a white T-shirt (designer unknown). I&apos;m thinking about adding a slightly threadbare dressing gown to the ensemble but I&apos;m worried because I&apos;ve heard less is more. What should I do?&quot; I think she&apos;s onyl contracted to be Asked once a week. You&apos;ll have to pay, but I reckon you can&apos;t go wrong with dressing gown.  20th over England 33-2 (Target 145; Strauss 21, Pieteresen 1)  Strauss has been struggling but he brings up the first boundary of the innings with a lovely glide to deep point. &quot;Surely I can&apos;t be the first to say that Trott has got the trotts,&quot; says Paul Walters. Correct you&apos;re not. But you are in the first 100,000 so you&apos;re doing OK.  WICKET!! England 33-3 (Pietersen lbw b Rehman 1)  It&apos;s a straight one and it would have clipped the top of the stumps \u2013 he reviews but the call goes with the on-field umpire and England are in real trouble. On a positive note, the socre 33-3 does have a nice symmetry about it.  WICKET!!!! England 37-4 (Morgan 0 b Rehman)  Anyone have much confidence in Morgan here? Well ... He misses the ball and is clean bowled.  22nd over England 39-4 (Target 145; Strauss 23, Prior 0) England captain Andrew Strauss needs, well, a captain&apos;s innings. He gets a couple down to third man. Luckily England&apos;s best batsmen all bat below No5 these days so all is not lost. &quot;If we&apos;re still on journeys, I&apos;ve flown home from Chisinau this morning courtesy of Air Moldova,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Could not have been easier. Mind you, the tough part is still to come - the 77 from Clapham Junction to Tooting.&quot; You should write a book on the 77 journey. One of the epics.  TEA: My word. Cook and Strauss we making steady if sloooow progress at the start of the innings but Pakistan&apos;s spinners started to strangle them and the pressure told. Once Cook was out nobody got in. England were relieved to go in for tea.  Elliot Wilson has a good Worst Journeys story: &quot;In 2008 I decided to take a trek across Kazakhstan Tom. I&apos;m a journalist and I&apos;d been to Almaty in Kazakhsan several times but I wanted to trek past the dying Aral Sea to the Caspian, so I flew up to a town called Kyszszlorda. It had been snowing however, so my onward train from Kyszszlorda to Aralsk had already left. The next one (which terminated in Moscow 60 hours later) didn&apos;t pass by for another 24 hours so I decided, at around midnight and in sub-zero temperatures (it was still early March on the steppe) to get a taxi the six hours to Aralsk, an ex-fishing port.  &quot;Unfortunately I was a) still dressed only in a suit and thin coat and b) I chose an insane taxi driver who stopped off in a nowhere village in the steppe to pick up his brother who, it turned out, was a leper. Only when he turned the car light and leered at me did I see half his face was hanging off.  &quot;This revelation, and the insane high-pitched giggle of the driver, who I picked up was his brother (a smattering of Russian helped) forced me, with rucksack, to make a fairly low-speed leap out of their Lada car and into the steppe. It took an hour to hike in the direction of some light (an &apos;Aral&apos; petrol station) where I got some mobile phone signal and phoned the only person I knew in Kyszszlorda, a friend of a Dutch journalist, who quickly found a couple of blokes who needed to be in Aralsk. Neither of them were lepers, and they drove me, and a car full of fruit they wanted to sell, to Aralsk, where I was mugged. But that&apos;s a story for another story.&quot;  Bring back Ravi (part one): &quot;I can&apos;t help thinking that if it was Ravi Bopara - who brings a lot more to the side than Morgan - getting out cheaply time and time again, there would be no end of headlines about how he&apos;s just not a Test cricketer,&quot; says Rob Marriott. &quot;But Eoin Morgan is apparently god&apos;s gift to middle order batting, so he&apos;ll be just fine, and turning out for England for some years to come without too much criticism. Bah, I say. Bopara is every bit as mediocre a Test batsman as the Irishman, every bit as unexceptional a fielder, plus he can bowl very usefully. Bopara. Now.&quot; Ravi? Are you there?  James Dart will be taking over for a while, so send your emails to james.dart@theguardian.com. He&apos;ll correct your spelling if you&apos;re nice to him.  Morning/afternoon/evening: Well, this is nice.  (Don&apos;t necessarily) bring back Ravi (part one): &quot;Ravi might be the next cab off the batting rank, but the best player of spin during England&apos;s ODI tour of India was Samit Patel whom I reckon would be a good replacement for Tremlett,&quot; writes Mike Selvey. &quot;And I disagree 100% with Lutz about the Strauss referral. That was a [Snip - OBO Bad Word ed] decision by Billy Bowden. So England are lucky it wasn&apos;t worse.&quot; Agreed.  23rd over: England 44-4 (Target 145; Strauss 27, Prior 1)  Prior is quick off the mark with a scampered single as Abdur Rehman resumes. Two balls later and Strauss is given some width, rocking back and calmly guiding the ball past square for four. &quot;I&apos;ve been moonlighting on the tennis MBM but your travel tales here take me back to India, an eight-hour journey (in theory) from McCleod Ganj to Chandigarh and a bus that leaked upwards,&quot; recalls Seamus Whitehead. &quot;Not only did the seat offer me no legroom, the backrest barely reached halfway up my back and the first six hours was spent lolling around as the bus careered down the mountains. After that the journey got steadily worse, as we waited at a flooded river for five hours with lights and music on full (whilst all other vehicles turned round and found another route) before setting off across flooded roads. This is when we noticed that the floor of the bus, two sheets of metal, wasn&apos;t joined properly and every &apos;lake&apos; we crossed sent a spurt of water shooting up to the ceiling of the bus, soaking yours truly. Sixteen wet hours later we slopped off the bus into Chandigarh.&quot; Saved you a shower.  24th over: England 44-4 (Target 145; Strauss 27, Prior 1)  Saeed Ajmal (1-15 off eight) resumes at the other end, giving Prior a testing working-over. He sees it through safely. Maiden.  25th over: England 51-4 (Target 145; Strauss 28, Prior 7)  A single for Strauss, followed by two more for Prior, reduces the target to two figures. And then Rehman is punished for dropping short to the England wicketkeeper, who crashes him through cover with a delicious drive. A vital, vital stand here.  26th over: England 51-4 (Target 145; Strauss 28, Prior 7)  A zinger from Ajmal beats the outside edge of Strauss and the off stump by a matter of milimetres. It was this close. Another maiden. &quot;I once had to walk from Headingley to the Leeds Metropolitan University campus,&quot; offers John Starbuck by way of (supposedly) awful journeys. &quot;It rained all the way and I was wearing new shoes, the heels of which clacked loudly so I was passing people expecting a stunning woman to hove into sight. Disappointment all round.&quot;  27th over: England 51-4 (Target 145; Strauss 28, Prior 7)  &quot;I am surprised at England&apos;s approach to this chase,&quot; muses Hashir Majid. &quot;Given how low the score is, it just needs one positive innings of an hour or so to set up the win.&quot; Not so easy to be so positive against Ajmal, mind. A maiden from Rehman keeps things tidy at the other end.  28th over: England 51-4 (Target 145; Strauss 28, Prior 7)  Another maiden from Ajmal as the pressure cranks up that little bit more. Probably about time I offered some abysmal journeys of my own. Domestically? While living in Leeds in 2000, took a trip down to watch England draw 0-0 with Argentina in a friendly at Wembley. Only for the tube to deliver me back to King&apos;s Cross just as the last train north of Peterborough for the night was pulling out. Cue a slow train to Peterborough, a cold night on the platform (with a rather scary individual roaming around the station), and an early train into Leeds the next morning for work. Lovely.  WICKET! Strauss lbw Rehman 32 (England 56-5) One delivery after confident sweeping Rehman for a boundary, Strauss is pinned on the back foot; the ball spins out of the rough and raps the England skipper on the pads. It goes to review, but \u2026 WICKET!  29th over: England 56-5 (Target 145; Prior 7, Trott 0)  And out comes Jonathan Trott \u2026  30th over: England 56-5 (Target 145; Prior 7, Trott 0)  Prior staves off another maiden from Ajmal (1-15 off 12, now). &quot;Further to my worst journey submission (7th over), may I propose a sub-thread of the worst arrival in the world?&quot; suggests Jamie Kirkcaldy. Go ahead, Jamie. &quot;Finally reaching San Francisco at around midnight, I decided to sleep for a few hours in the bus station but a despotic jobsworth told me that only outgoing passengers were allowed to stay overnight and kicked me out. I noticed that another passenger had suffered the same fate so asked her if she was a local and could direct me to an all-night coffee house where I could wait the night out. She seemed to interpret this request as &apos;please take me on a tour of the dodgiest areas of the city, I would like to be stabbed&apos;.&quot; Easy mistake to make. &quot;Having spent half an hour trying to find a liquor store in what she informed me the locals referred to as &apos;crack town&apos;, we ended up sitting in a children&apos;s play area in a housing project drinking neat vodka while she filled me in on how her lover got her addicted to heroin to stop her leaving. I can assure you that I was not wearing any flowers in my hair.&quot;  31st over: England 60-5 (Target 145; Prior 11, Trott 1)  Cool heads in short supply all round: Trott fishes a little cut behind square, which is fielded superbly by Umar Gul; the batsmen get in an almighty mess and Trott ultimately is left to chase down to the other end, looking way, way short of his ground. But as the ball comes in to the wicketkeeper, he completely fluffs his lines and Trott is able to sneak home for a single. Prior then adds a useful three with a similar stroke that beats the fielder off the final ball off the over. &quot;Taking Hashir Majid&apos;s point (27th over), England could have sent Broad in at No3 for a biff and, if he had repeated his first innings, the game would be settled,&quot; writes Gary Naylor. &quot;If he had failed, well we still had the &apos;batting&apos; to come.&quot;  32nd over: England 60-5 (Target 145; Prior 11, Trott 1)  Big appeals from Pakistan, the second of which results in a REVIEW of a shout for lbw against Prior off Ajmal. It looks pretty clearly to be missing leg, which the review highlights. An overexcitable waste. Pakistan are now 2-13 for reviews in this series so far. Maiden.  33rd over: England 60-5 (Target 145; Prior 11, Trott 1)  Adnan Akmal continues to appeal for absolutely everything behind the stumps. Trott remains cool and sees off a Rehman maiden. He doesn&apos;t quite look 100% but the way in which he scampered through for three a couple of overs back suggests he&apos;s up for the fight. &quot;We miss Tresco at the top for these small chases, he&apos;d blast us off to 40-0 from seven or eight overs and we&apos;d be on the front foot,&quot; laments Ian Truman. &quot;So I&apos;d have sent out KP and Swanny to open with a licence to blast it and set the field back. England would never do that though, so don&apos;t know why I mention it really.&quot;  34th over: England 63-5 (Target 145; Prior 14, Trott 1)  Prior works Ajmal through the off-side for two and continues to get a good stride down the pitch in the face of this testing bowling. He adds another single down to square leg with a sweep. The over ends with Akmal going up for a huge shout as Trott is clipped a little outside off by Ajmal. It&apos;s now 82 to win. &quot;In Kenya, I spent about five hours on a bus eye-to-eye with a pair of chickens, which one of the passengers standing crammed into the aisle was holding,&quot; writes Jason Grove. &quot;The bus itself was bright green and adorned with a logo I don&apos;t remember, though I like to think it was something like &apos;live free or die&apos;. It was all topped off with a nice string of christmas lights round the top and a spoiler, presumably to keep the back wheels on the ground while the driver careened through the winding hill roads. No walkman for me, but the bus thoughtfully came equipped with one of those big speakers that bands in pubs usually use, all the better to blast African pop music at us. There was a brief &apos;respite&apos; from the music however, when a preacher got on and tried to save everyone by yelling at them in Kiswahili. He got off at the next town - about three quarters of an hour later - and normal service on the speaker was resumed.&quot;  WICKET! Trott lbw Rehman 1 (England 68-6) Ah. A loose-ball from Rehman gives England four useful leg-byes, but he follows it straight up with a beauty, trapping Trott plumb lbw. It straightened up brilliantly and Trott was well, well beaten.  WICKET! Broad b Rehman 0 (England 68-7) This is all over. Stuart Broad arrives at the crease and is immediately the subject of a big appeal. It&apos;s waved away, but he survives just a single delivery more: Rehman gets one to turn in from outside off-stump, clipping Broad&apos;s inside edge and flying on to the stumps. A really impressive five-for now for Rehman.  WICKET! Swann lbw Ajmal 0 (England 71-8) There&apos;s no escaping it: as impressive as Rehman and Ajmal have been (7-46 off nearly 25 overs between them), this is a miserable collapse from England. Prior adds three, cutting one past the despairing dive of first slip. But that leaves Swann on strike, and Ajmal rips one in from outside off stump, trapping the batsman plumb. England still need 74 more. &quot;Is it cowardly to pray that we can take the positive that at least we can watch the Liverpool v Manchester United game?&quot; asks Neil Withers. It starts in 50 minutes.  36th over: England 72-8 (Target 145; Prior 18, Anderson 1)  James Anderson arrives and is off the mark with a single. &quot;There is still hope \u2026 Monty to carry on his revival and smack a fifty,&quot; cheers Phil Withall. &quot;Simple. Yes, I have been drinking, but you have to have a little faith.&quot; Only if that faith if 50% proof or more.  WICKET! Prior c Shafiq b Ajmal 18 (England 72-9) A composed knock from Prior concludes with an ugly, loose stroke: he drives Ajmal uppishly on the off-side, mistiming his stroke and Shafiq takes an easy catch.  WICKET! Anderson c Gul b Rehman 1 (England 72) Filth. Anderson sweep-slogs off Rehman, but the ball skies high to deep square-leg, where Gul almost misjudges, before taking a composed diving catch in front of him. It&apos;s all over.  Pakistan win the second Test by 72 runs and take an (unassailable) 2-0 series lead. England&apos;s lowest ever Test score against Pakistan, apparently, and Andy Flower&apos;s (world No1) team have only pride and some ranking points to play for in the final Test.  The aftermath (from your emails): &quot;Yesterday on TMS, Geoff Boycott said that he would put his house on an England win,&quot; recalls Umran Sarwar. &quot;Do we want to do a whip-round for the old boy to put him up in a shelter for the night?&quot; &quot;Earlier today, Zimbabwe lost all 20 wickets inside one day in Napier,&quot; writes Chris Kilford. &quot;Are England trying to upstage them?&quot; &quot;One word for that,&quot; sniffs Jerry Thomas. &quot;Pathetic.&quot;  Journey&apos;s end: That&apos;s that for now. We&apos;ll be back for coverage of the third Test. Thanks for all your mails. I&apos;ll leave you with these: &quot;Apropos the worst journey riff, I lived in north London for a couple of years and used to regularly take the N29 on Saturday nights,&quot; writes Matthew Webb. &quot;There must be others reading who can fully grasp the horror of that statement.&quot; &quot;Speaking of horrendous journeys, a most memorable one was travelling back from the Isle of Wight to York after the Bestival music festival in 2008,&quot; says Richard in York. &quot;Anyone that was there could confirm that the weather leading up to the festival was rain, rain and more rain, causing the festival site to be 99% mud and 1% vegetation. However, like some sort of moron I had only brought with me one pair of jeans and one pair of light trainers to wear all weekend. My friend and I fashioned some temporary waterproof socks to wear over our feet (plastic bags). Anyway, the journey back involved a bus, a boat, and then a train journey for several hours up to York. Unwashed and caked in mud from waist down, I wasn&apos;t the most popular passenger on the quiet coach of a Crosscountry train filled mostly with Monday evening commuters. One poor lady even opted to change trains than sit next to me. So, all in all, not a terrible journey for me, but for everyone else sitting in Coach B. I had my comeuppance mind, as when I got to York, worried that I couldn&apos;t feel my toes, I was informed by my GP that I&apos;d gotten trench foot after a weekend of wearing plastic bags over sweaty feet.&quot; &quot;I was on a four-leg overnight Greyhound ride from Brunswick GA to New Orleans,&quot; remembers Dan Wilson. &quot;Before the bus departed Tallahassee, the man sitting behind me who looked like John C Reilly was told by the driver he had to stow away his tool box underneath. He protested that they couldn&apos;t exactly be used as offensive weapons but complied. My neighbour, who I shall name Pedro, joked &apos;I hope he doesn&apos;t find my knives&apos;. I laughed politely. Then, when the bus was on its way, he got out his phone and started muttering into it in Spanish for about a minute then stopped speaking and held it up whereupon it started emitting a loud beep every so often. It was loud enough to anger the bus driver who demanded to know whose the phone was. Mindful of Pedro&apos;s knives, I said nothing. He owned up eventually and we were back on the road. Then, thinking this guy couldn&apos;t get any weirder, for the remainder of the overnight bus journey, Pedro vigorously rubbed his groin. Through his trousers, but still, I couldn&apos;t let myself go to sleep. Whatever this guy&apos;s itch was, he wasn&apos;t satisfied for hours. I dunno if this makes it more or less creepy, but it turned out, as we disembarked in Mobile, that his wife and child were in the seats in front.&quot;", "sentences": ["Which sort of worked, except that in the morning the aeroplane was broken and the flight cancelled, so instead of a comfy hotel bed and afternoon flight I spent a day hanging around Bristol, Amsterdam and Copenhagen airports with no sleep smelling a bit funny."], "title": "Pakistan v England, day four \u2013 as it happened | Tom Lutz and James Dart", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/28/pakistan-england-2011-12-pakistancricketteam", "tags": ["Pakistan v England 2011-12", "Pakistan cricket team", "England cricket team", "Sport", "Cricket", "Over by over reports"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-28T20:00:00Z", "article": "Maybe being young is never easy. But being a twentysomething young European has rarely been more stressful. More than a quarter (28%) of Italians between 16 and 24 are unemployed. Others are struggling to get by on unpaid internships or poorly paid jobs with little security. Italy&apos;s new prime minister, Mario Monti, has vowed to help the younger generation, promising among other things to help them start businesses, but as austerity bites deep the future is uncertain, even terrifying, for many. It&apos;s not just Italy, of course. Eurozone unemployment is at a record. According to Eurostat, the EU&apos;s statistical office, 16.3 million people are out of work in the 17 countries that joined the euro. The story of a lost generation is becoming the scandal of a continent. In Spain, 51.4% of those aged 16-24 are jobless. In Greece, the figure is 43%. As the eurozone crisis worsened, I went back to my hometown of Civita Castellana, 65 kilometres north of Rome, to meet my classmates from the Giuseppe Colasanti high school. Michela, Maria, Elena, Elisa, Michele, Martina and I were in the class of 2005. When Monti announced his \u20ac30bn austerity package, he said: &quot;Sacrifice will be required.&quot; In Civita, those sacrifices are being made. It is one of the largest industrial centres in the region. Since the end of the second world war, about 90% of people been employed making bathroom fittings and crockery, for which Civita is renowned. What everyone now calls &quot;the crisis&quot; arrived here earlier than elsewhere, as the town suffered the consequences of globalisation and competition with China, where similar products were being made more cheaply. Many factories have closed; thousands are out of work. The debt crisis that began in 2008 means redundancy hangs over many of those who have kept jobs. Then there are the young. Getting a foot on the ladder has never been simple in Italy, where who you know is often key. But with the country facing austerity for the foreseeable future, and eurozone GDP as a whole predicted to shrink by 0.5% in 2012, the outlook is bleak. So meeting my schoolmates again was quite an experience. My decision six months ago to live and work in London was partly to do with the economy. But how had my schoolmates been getting on? Martina Rossitto, 26, MA student, human biology &quot;I am doing a traineeship at the laboratory for cystic fibrosis of Bambino Ges\u00f9 hospital in Rome. I was lucky, as they do serious research there. I got the place because I know one of the doctors in the lab. I am not getting paid, not even expenses. However, I consider myself to be privileged, as most of my university mates are working 12 hours a day and don&apos;t even have access to basic research tools. In Italy, choosing to work as a researcher is suicide. The government keeps cutting the funds.&quot; Maria Francesca Zozi, 26, MA student, arts &quot;I am usually told I will be a useless graduate. I find it unbelievable: governments keep investing in other sectors and they cut on arts and education. It is simply ridiculous. The problem is that the public sector \u2013 which includes most of our arts heritage \u2013 is corrupt and inefficient. I have a lot of projects in mind, I would like to attend a course at Brera Academy of Arts in Milan, but I really cannot afford it. I would leave the country if it weren&apos;t for my boyfriend, who says we have to stay and fight for a better future.&quot; Elisa Di Pietro Paolo, 25, unemployed shop assistant &quot;I looked for a job as soon as I left high school six years ago. I found one as a shop assistant in Rome, on a short-term contract. My employers used to renew every year, until one day they didn&apos;t. They fired a girl who had worked for them for five years because she took sick leave for pneumonia. Since last January I have been unemployed and doing occasional jobs: for a holiday camp, leafleting, and now for a non-profit thing. The problem is that, having worked as a trainee, employers must hire me on a proper contract, and it&apos;s not convenient to them.&quot; Michele Stentella, 26, DJ and student in political science &quot;I have been DJing for years. Besides doing some nights in a major club in Rome, I have also started to work as a producer. If things go well, I might also sign with an important label. But the crisis has struck in my area, too. More and more clubs are closing. People cannot afford to spend much money and we all feel the pinch at the end of the month. I have a registered logo, and four guys who work with me. I really hope I can keep doing this job. Meanwhile, I study and maybe a BA degree will turn out to be useful some day.&quot; Michela Moretti, 25, trainee lawyer &quot;I have just graduated in law and I started a traineeship in a law firm near my hometown, Viterbo. Of course, they are not even paying me expenses. The only people I know who are getting paid during their traineeship are lawyers&apos; children. They go to their parents&apos; law firm and they get paid. With Monti&apos;s talk about liberalising the professions, everything is still more unclear for us. They&apos;re even talking about getting rid of the traineeship. It&apos;s going to be very confusing.&quot; Elena Cirioni, 25, trainee radio journalist &quot;I did a two-year internship for a local FM radio which never even paid me the expenses. Fortunately, I got another opportunity with a private web radio station which is paying me the expenses and is helping me obtain a journalist&apos;s licence. I work 15 to 20 hours a week and I get paid \u20ac200 a month. My dream was to become a theatre actress and I am still hoping to fulfill this Athensambition at some point. The problem is that the culture industry is eternally in crisis in Italy, and there isn&apos;t the money for new actors.&quot; GREECE     Left to right, Christos Xeraxoudis, Evangelia Hadzichristofi and Giorgos Dimas Photograph: Milos Bicanski For The Observer    The greatest victims of Greece&apos;s economic crisis have been its youth, men and women who never knew the boom times but must now bear the brunt of one of Europe&apos;s harshest austerity programmes. With unemployment at a record as the debt-choked country endures a fifth consecutive year of recession, nearly 44% of the 907,953 out of work are between 15 and 24. For the first time since the 1960s, the jobless rate has nudged 18.5%, according to data released by the national statistics office in November. Four out of 10 without work are young people, although three months later, with ever more businesses closing, the figures are undoubtedly worse. Lack of job prospects and the absence of vocational training to redirect the newly unemployed, fears of impending economic collapse and warnings that it may take 10 years before the service-oriented economy even begins to recover have spurred many of the brightest and best to look abroad. The exodus has sparked a brain drain that could have a devastating effect on the country&apos;s future growth. Tens of thousands of young Greeks are believed to have moved overseas in the last two years. Almost always from part of the educated elite, they have gone to other European countries and as far as Australia. An 800-seat Australian &quot;skills expo&quot; in Athens in October attracted 13,000 applicants. Community leaders in Melbourne, focus of a similar Greek migration in the 1950s and 1960s, have been flooded by requests from Greek graduates. Christos Xeraxoudis, 24, unemployed chef &quot;I&apos;m a trained chef and have been looking for work for months. I&apos;ve sent my CV to hotels and restaurants all over Greece, but out of the 50 or applications that I&apos;ve made I only got an answer once. Lately I&apos;ve looked for jobs in the UK, Germany and Switzerland, where I happen to have relatives, but I&apos;ve had no response. But I am optimistic. Greece needed to change. It needs to be rebuilt from the beginning. It has so much going for it but somehow had lost its way. After all, we had got to the point where we were importing lemons from Argentina.&quot; Evangelia Hadzichristofi, 26, unemployed interior designer &quot;I&apos;ve been out of work for the last year. It&apos;s hard. I&apos;m an interior designer and our industry has been very badly hit. I had an internship at the Benaki Museum [in Athens], but then they let me go and it&apos;s been impossible to find a job since. I&apos;ve looked for work as a secretary, receptionist, shop assistant and the answer has always been &apos;no&apos;. It&apos;s got to the point where I am counting every cent and have to rely on my father, who is in difficulty himself with his own business. I&apos;ve just applied for jobs in England and Amsterdam because at least there is always overseas.&quot; Giorgos Dimas, 25, working as a chef  &quot;I was unemployed for three years until last week when I finally found a job as a chef. I went back to school to train as a cook, and I&apos;ve been learning English but it&apos;s been really difficult. At the back of my mind there is always the thought that the restaurant I&apos;m about to work in might go bust, given that no one has any money any more. But although it might take a few years for my generation to find work I actually think the crisis has been a good thing. Greece was all about jobs for civil servants and nothing else. It had to change.&quot; Report by Helena Smith Athens SPAIN     Left to right, Eduardo Ca\u00f1a, Marita Bl\u00e1zquez, Adriano Justicia and Mar\u00eda L\u00e1zaro. Photograph: Erik Molgora For The Observer    Now is not the time to be a twentysomething in Spain. According to figures last week, 51.4% of 16-24 year-olds are now without work, as the total unemployment count passed the 5 million barrier. This has often been called the best-educated generation in Spain. It is also the one which has the direst prospects. Even if they are lucky enough to get a job, most of them \u2013 around 60% \u2013 have to live on low salaries with little job security. The usual best options are internships or temporary contracts that allow the employer to fire them without difficulty. The situation is now critical, as indicated by prime minister Mariano Rajoy&apos;s plea last week to Brussels. He demanded greater &quot;realism&quot; from Brussels over Spain&apos;s attempts to cut its deficit. Austerity is sending Spain back into recession and the danger is that a generation is to be sacrificed as a result. About a decade ago, a new term was coined to describe young people who earned \u20ac1,000 a month \u2013 the mileuristas. Now things are so bad that this disparaging term describes an unattainable aspiration for most. Eduardo Ca\u00f1a, 23, student &quot;I am studying journalism and economics and I&apos;ve done all sort of low-paid jobs: serving beers in Valencia beach bars, working in construction in Galicia, unloading fruit trucks and filling customers&apos; bags in Ikea. I&apos;ve never been paid more than \u20ac7 an hour. I also worked as an intern for a newspaper, almost for free. This friend of mine was working on a paper for less than \u20ac400 a month. Her temporary contract expired and they called to offer me the same job but as an unpaid intern. I found that so offensive. I am finishing school next June and if nothing comes up I am thinking about moving abroad.&quot; Marita Bl\u00e1zquez, 25, student &quot;I&apos;ve found it impossible to get a job in my own field. In my hometown of Granada, I worked as a monitor in a shopping mall kids&apos; play area and that&apos;s the closest I&apos;ve got to working with kids, which has been my goal since I started studying. I came to Madrid but all I could get were two part-time jobs, first at a department store and then in a clothes shop, where they hired me as a clerk with an illegal contract making \u20ac3 an hour. When I asked for better conditions my boss fired me. I started studying again to become a teacher. But only a few posts are open every year so I have no idea what I am doing next.&quot; Adriano Justicia, 27, unemployed photographer &quot;I am a photographer and also hold a film studies degree, but never could find a job in any of those areas. I&apos;ve worked as a telemarketer, in credit card sales and also a Red Cross charity recruiter for not much money at all. I just went back to study for a degree in TV production, which includes unpaid training. If I don&apos;t get a job after that, I think I will be forced to move back to Berlin, where I spent a couple of months as an intern for a photographic studio. Given the circumstances, that looks like the best option, although it is always difficult to leave your country.&quot; Mar\u00eda L\u00e1zaro, 25, jobless tour and advertisement agent &quot;I came to Madrid to work as a manager for Real Madrid&apos;s museum. I worked at Santiago Bernab\u00e9u stadium museum for two years until I was fired six months ago. Since then I&apos;ve been working in temporary jobs, three or five days as a hostess in business conventions and fairs, most of them without any kind of contract. My partner works as a graphic designer and he has just been offered a job in Zaragoza, so we are probably moving there. I just got admitted back into school, where I am hoping to do a masters degree, to see if that helps me finally to get a job.&quot; Report by Diego Salazar Madrid", "sentences": ["I&apos;ve just applied for jobs in England and Amsterdam because at least there is always overseas.&quot; Giorgos Dimas, 25, working as a chef  &quot;I was unemployed for three years until last week when I finally found a job as a chef."], "title": "Europe's lost generation: how it feels to be young and struggling in the EU", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/28/europes-lost-generation-young-eu", "tags": ["Italy", "Spain", "Greece", "Unemployment and employment statistics", "World news", "European Union", "Eurozone crisis", "Economics", "Europe", "Youth unemployment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-29T00:04:00Z", "article": "For Salman Rushdie, the &quot;affair&quot; is over. When he walks into a Notting Hill restaurant, his eyes do not scan the room for signs of danger. The other diners do not wolf down their meals and scuttle for the exit, in case today is the day when the bomber gets through. They treat the entrance of a writer, who once could not move without a posse of suspicious security guards, as an unremarkable event. Rushdie is fine. More than fine, actually: he&apos;s flourishing. Deepa Mehta has filmed Midnight&apos;s Children. Rushdie has written the script, so if viewers wish to protest that the film diminishes, trivialises or otherwise fails to match the glittering standards of his masterpiece they must direct their complaints to him. A US cable network has commissioned him to write a sci-fi series and, like so many others, Rushdie relishes the space and freedom American television gives to\u00a0dramatists. The terror, which once dominated his life and the lives of everyone associated with his work, is history now. When Ayatollah Khomeini ordered Muslims to kill him for his blasphemies, Julian Barnes gave him a shrewd piece of advice. However many attempts were made on his life and lives of his translators and publishers, however many times Special Branch moved him from safe house to safe house, he must not allow the &quot;Rushdie affair&quot; to turn him into an obsessive. Totalitarians are like stalkers or internet trolls. They want their targets to think about them constantly. Rushdie did not become like his enemies. He never replicated the fanaticism they directed against him. He has been a good friend to other victims of religious terror, but in his novels and children&apos;s stories he has tackled new themes. Despite the entreaties of his agent, he put off writing his autobiography until he was able to view the &quot;affair&quot; with detachment. It should be out in September and I would be astonished if it is not read around the world. Rushdie has had a flat in London for decades, but tells me he spends more and more time in New York. Like Martin Amis, he finds the viciousness of the British media towards writers mystifying. Journalists who rely on their exercise of freedom of speech to put food on their tables and clothes on their children&apos;s backs hate a man who had to risk his life to defend the liberties they so thoughtlessly take for granted. I am not going to go into why English literature&apos;s first great Asian novelist is the object of such venom, and was cheered to find that Rushdie did not want to speculate either. Aware of the danger of sounding like a moaner, he adds that Americans may not turn on their writers with the passion of the British because they care so little about what novelists have to say that they lack the energy even to loathe\u00a0them. He laughs and looks every inch an artist at ease with himself. Khomeini is dead and he is still alive. The Satanic Verses is still in print. Film producers, TV executives, publishers and readers all want him. Why shouldn&apos;t he relax? When I began a book on modern censorship, it was obvious to me that I could not avoid The Satanic Verses. Before the ayatollahs went for Rushdie, writers in secular or religious dictatorships could find a place of sanctuary in the west. The fatwa stopped all that. It redrew the boundaries of the free world, shrinking its borders and erasing zones of disputation from the map of the liberal mind. The terror that the bombs and the attempted murders spread meant that London, New York, Paris, Copenhagen and Amsterdam were no longer places of safety for writers tackling religious themes. From 1989 onwards westerners and refugees from religious terror knew that it could happen here because it had happened here. The hypocrisies and evasions that so disfigure our culture began then. As I typed I worried that I was writing for readers in their early twenties who were not even born when The Satanic Verses was published. I shouldn&apos;t have fretted. Rushdie has found peace, but the &quot;Rushdie affair&quot; will not go away. It cannot because it is the starkest representation in our times of the conflict between individual conscience and the authoritarian mind, which is never won but must always be\u00a0fought. I saw Rushdie a few days after India had forced him to cancel an appearance at the Jaipur literature festival. The authorities said his physical presence or even an address via video link might lead to assassination attempts, riots, injuries and deaths. India, a supposedly secular democracy, was now banning its greatest writer from talking to his fellow Indians. As Rushdie realised, religious sectarians and fabulously cynical politicians were once again using The Satanic Verses, which is banned in India, to whip the faithful into line. Although he had visited India many times since 1989 without incident, Muslim leaders saw a chance to create a controversy where none existed. They told the festival organisers that they must not allow &quot;an enemy of Islam&quot; to speak. Rushdie is an atheist. If his intelligence had not already made him one, his experience of fascistic violence would have done the job just as well. But, as he asked the viewers of Indian television, who is the real enemy of Islam here? Rushdie, who used his right to speak his mind to criticise its founding myths, or &quot;various extremist leaders and their followers, who \u2026 strengthen the extremely negative image of Islam as an intolerant, repressive and violent culture [that] every time it&apos;s crossed ... resorts to threats and violence?&quot; Congress, once the secular party of Jawaharlal Nehru, is now thoroughly debased. It is as keen on fomenting communalist scares as its Hindu nationalist opponents. It wanted the Muslim vote to turn out in elections in Uttar Pradesh, the most important Indian state. India&apos;s Muslims are among the most disadvantaged groups in the country. Instead of offering them healthcare, jobs or anything so radical as education for women, however, Congress politicians schemed to stop Rushdie visiting his native land. As India Today concluded, they manufactured &quot;a massive threat perception&quot; so Rushdie would not appear and Congress could &quot;showcase&quot; itself as the &quot;caretaker of Muslim interests&quot;. In You Can&apos;t Read This Book, I argue against the comforting idea that progress is inevitable and that we must be freer than our supposedly repressed and stuffy ancestors. Rushdie&apos;s case was the best evidence I could find. He and his contemporaries in the 1980s thought they could challenge religions that claimed dominion over minds and bodies. Since then our world has changed, and not for the better. &quot;The change can fit into a sentence,&quot; I say. &quot;No young artist of Rushdie&apos;s range and gifts would dare write a modern version of The Satanic Verses today, and if he or she did, no editor would dare publish it.&quot; Rushdie half agrees, but thinks the cowardice resides almost exclusively in the offices of publishers, broadcasters and newspaper editors. Writers should be braver. Far from being cowed by the clerical-political alliance that targeted him, Rushdie went on Indian television and lacerated the cynics who threatened &quot;the liberty of ordinary Indian citizens to hear differing points of view&quot;. The Indian press took up the charge and accused Congress of making their country look sinister and preposterous in the eyes of the world. Congress&apos;s attempt to whip up sectarian hatred has exploded in its face. Rushdie&apos;s Indian enemies are now in full retreat. As he walked out into London&apos;s winter sunshine, I reflected that after all these years Rushdie remained an example worth following. Decline is no more inevitable than progress.

It has been for a while. Like the international break before it, a weekend of fixtures in the &quot;greatest domestic cup competition in the world&quot; is fast becoming a chance to indulge those areas of your life that have been neglected for some time. You may decide to pay attention to the interests of your loved ones or, if that is a stretch too far, it is at least an opportunity to get back in touch with some other sports that may not ordinarily get a look in on your busy fixture list. Saturday&apos;s 3pm kick-offs were about as dull as it can possibly get. They were about as magical as a slot machine in a dingy pub and as romantic as a stroll through Amsterdam&apos;s red-light district. When Derby County versus Stoke City is the glamour tie you know you are in trouble. Defenders of the once-great competition will argue that television and police demands have moved all the good fixtures to Saturday or Sunday morning or evening or, this season, Friday night, but the real problem is that the majority of the teams taking part are not that interested in winning the competition. These problems are not new, but this weekend&apos;s games only served to underline them. Of course there was Liverpool versus Manchester United \u2013 one of the great fixtures of the English calender \u2013 but the depressingly poor standard of the game, along with unedifying behaviour among sections of both sides&apos; support meant it was hard to rejoice in the game in any real way. In the interest of fairness, honourable mentions must go to both of Sunday&apos;s games, but the drama on show at the Stadium of Light and the Emirates only emphasised what it could be like if all teams had a real interest in winning their games. Abandoning replays, moving ties to midweek and returning the semi-finals to neutral stadiums are the solutions most often put forward to inject some life into the competition. The reality is that until there is a larger financial incentive on offer for the winner, as well as a reduction in ticket prices at grounds then the FA Cup is going to suffer. Unfortunately neither of these are likely to happen any time soon. Perhaps most worryingly of all for the FA Cup is that the ties thrown up by Sunday&apos;s fifth-round draw promise to be even worse. EF 2) Beckford loves the FA Cup Although he scored once for Everton in four appearances in the FA Cup last year, Jermaine Beckford&apos;s late arrival for the fifth-round defeat by Reading, after being delayed by an accident on the M62, overshadowed the contribution he had made earlier in the competition with his goal against Scunthorpe United. This season, though, with five goals in two ties following his \u00a33m transfer to Leicester, he has rediscovered the knack that first brought him to prominence with Leeds United, then a League One side, for whom he netted the winner against Manchester United and both goals in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane in 2010. In total he has now scored 14 goals in 16 FA Cup games, or 13 in 12 if we exclude last season&apos;s blip, and his two finishes against Swindon Town, first with his right foot then with his left on the half-volley, were the kind of cool, instinctive finishes in the penalty box that he has frequently fluffed in the past. His particular strength during his three years in the first team at Elland Road was his ability to lurk in the inside-left channel, where he exploited the space to escape from the full-back before opening his body to curl a shot around the covering central defender and in at the far post. His tendency, however, to miss easier chances than the ones he carved out for himself left him with a reputation for exasperating as much as he delighted. The stunning goal he scored for Everton against Chelsea on the last day of the 2010-11 season, where he raced from his own half and beat four defenders before finishing, demonstrated his flair for the spectacular. Yet when it came to quick-thinking in the opposition&apos;s area, scavenging for the kind of chances that a more orthodox poacher would consider routine, he tended to snatch at them. At times he looked the opposite of the stereotype \u2013 the more time he had to think the better he was. That was what was so encouraging in his performance for Leicester against Swindon. Jon Culley in the Independent on Sunday wrote that the second goal was one &quot;he could not miss&quot;. But in the past it is precisely those chances that he has missed. This time, from a cross and a rebound he swept the ball into the net. Admittedly the opposition were a League Two side but they played very well, kept Leicester&apos;s keeper Kasper Schmeichel on his mettle all game and would have benefitted had the referee, Darren Drysdale, not been so lenient when he gave City&apos;s Paul Konchesky a yellow card for a wild, high, scything foul on Simon Ferry in the dying minutes of the first half when a red would have been more just. Last week the Leeds chairman, Ken Bates, discussed Beckford&apos;s decision to leave his club on a free transfer for Everton and claimed with some disdain: &quot;For those interested, he was offered back to us last month.&quot; On the evidence of Beckford&apos;s form in the FA Cup at least, Bates&apos;s mockery is once again as ungracious as it is untimely. RB 3) Halsey&apos;s softly, softly approach worked It is not often that referees come out of the post-match press conferences unscathed. Rather than pinpoint their own failings or say where the team went wrong, managers take the route-one approach and blame the referee. But after Liverpool&apos;s win against Manchester United there was not even a whisper from Kenny Dalglish or Sir Alex Ferguson about Mark Halsey&apos;s performance. With all the tempestuous history between these teams \u2013 both new and old \u2013 as well as the build-up in the media during the week, even the whiff of a wrong decision could have seen this match spill over. While other referees might have felt the need to issue a card early to let the players know who was in charge and to try to set a tone of discipline, Halsey&apos;s softly, softly approach worked like a dream. He was helped, of course, by the behaviour of the players. But he kept his head and, with the exception of a yellow for Rafael da Silva, his cards in his pocket. Too often referees are castigated for mistakes, perceived or otherwise, and Halsey will be glad his name did not arise for the wrong reasons. In the event a kind word from Ferguson and Dalglish would not have come amiss but that was evidently asking too much. IMC 4) West Bromwich need more urgency at home Dithering was West Bromwich Albion&apos;s undoing in their defeat by Norwich City but in more ways than simply Craig Dawson&apos;s fatal dawdling in possession on the edge of the box that gifted the visitors a winning goal. Five wins away in the Premier League have masked West Bromwich&apos;s poor form at home and after the latest defeat they are left with a record of only three victories in 13 matches at the Hawthorns in all competitions and have lost eight games. Playing a counterattacking style away has served them well but Roy Hodgson&apos;s decision to send out a weakened starting XI in a 4-5-1 formation with Simon Cox, ostensibly a centre-forward, on the right side of midfield smacked of excessive caution, particularly as the manager had said Premier League survival remained his priority and therefore had nothing to lose in the FA Cup. Albion created some decent chances and the strong running of Jerome Thomas on the left wing gave the midfield an outlet but the tactic Hodgson seems most wedded to, looking for Graham Dorrans and James Morrison to provide a killer, defence-splitting ball, is one to which the opposition quickly grows accustomed. So they press high, deny the central midfielders time and space and stifle the favoured strategy. This leads to the midfield passing short among themselves, or back to the defence and failing to get the ball up front quickly. They enjoy enough possession to suggest they dominate games at home but too much of it comes in sterile areas. After criticism that the previous two Baggies&apos; managers \u2013 Tony Mowbray and Roberto Di Matteo \u2013 played too open a game in the Premier League, leaving defenders exposed, it is understandable that Hodgson sought to redress this imbalance. But some urgency is required at home if he is not to end more games claiming his side&apos;s performance did not merit defeat. His players&apos; industry is plain to see. It&apos;s enterprise that is lacking at the Hawthorns. RB 5) Constant advertising saps the soul And now, a message from our sponsors. It says much for the corporate nature of modern football that it is a blessed relief when television and radio commentators simply refer to the oldest cup competition in the world as the FA Cup, without feeling the need to tag on a mention of Budweiser at the end. The situation has already spiralled out of control in the Barclay-fied Premier League, where managers like Owen Coyle regular call it &quot;The Barclays Premier League&quot; as if it&apos;s the most natural thing in the world. But throughout the weekend, anyone watching a Cup tie on TV would have had their ears defiled by the immortal line &quot;The FA Cup with Budweiser&quot;. No alcohol-fuelled romance to be found here. Now, there would have to be something irredeemably wrong with you if you immediately jumped off the sofa, ran to your nearest off-licence and bought a year&apos;s supply of the stuff. Not only because it&apos;s one of the worst beers around, but also because you have to be 18 to drink, and therefore not a child, and therefore not impressionable enough to see a can of beer in a shop and think &quot;Oh wow! They sponsor the FA Cup! The FA Cup. Well I&apos;ve got to get me one of those. I&apos;d be stupid not to.&quot; This is the world we live in though, where the corporate sponsor is as important as the football itself \u2013 Club Wembley, we&apos;re looking at you \u2013 and where the football supporter has to like it or lump it. Believe it or not, Barclays is not going to disappear if Coyle just says &quot;Premier League&quot; like a real human being. The likelihood is that it is a decree from on high but there is actually something rather desperate about sponsors being so eager to be seen at every single opportunity. Time was when Budweiser influenced football in a good way, inspiring Thierry Henry&apos;s Wassup Moment against Manchester United in 2000 and offering us gems like added time multi-ball. Now there&apos;s just a naffness about the whole in-your-face carry-on, a depressing reminder that football has forgotten about the little guy and has no intention of remembering any time soon.

The scheme, which was set up in 1964, makes payments - according to set tariff figures - for those who are physically injured by a violent criminal act. The government estimates that the scheme has awarded 20,000 people with criminal records a total of more than \u00a375m over the past decade. In one case, a convicted rapist was awarded \u00a362,000 for serious injuries, including the loss of a leg. Under the proposals, those with unspent convictions will be banned from applying for compensation under the scheme. It sounds an attractive reform. But on a human level, there is danger. There is nothing which directly links the prohibition on compensation to the nature of the applicant&apos;s previous conviction. For example, a mugger could not get compensation if he himself were later mugged. Or imagine a 20-year old student who is caught returning from Amsterdam with cannabis in her rucksack. She gets a fine, or perhaps a community service order. Four years later, she has a good job and is walking down the street when she is violently assaulted. Under Clarke&apos;s proposals, she will not be entitled to compensation under the scheme, because fines and community service do not become &apos;spent&apos; until after five years. Leaked reports suggest that there will be exemptions to this rule, such as prisoners injured while rushing to the aid of a prison officer under attack, or people convicted of a minor offence such as shoplifting. The injustice arises just over the &apos;minor offence&apos; threshold. Of course, it could be argued that the woman can sue her attacker. But why should she have to subject herself to the aggravation \u2013 and physical and financial risks \u2013 associated with that? And what if the attacker doesn&apos;t have the money to pay? The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme was set up to avoid precisely this type of problem. Will this reform also result in a willingness by police and prison officers to use increased physical force when restraining or questioning known criminals? If a police officer knows Cica would not entertain any claim of assault, because the individual has a criminal record, it makes it less likely that they will face scrutiny over their actions. Again, it is no answer to say that they can bring a civil action \u2013 the absence of legal aid makes this a very difficult claim to launch. What Clarke does not mention is that the current version of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme already contains something not too dissimilar to his rather arbitrary proposal. Under paragraph 14(3) of the scheme, Cica must refuse or reduce an award because the applicant&apos;s character \u2013 as demonstrated by his/her unspent convictions \u2013 makes it inappropriate to make a full award. So the scheme currently has discretion to refuse awards to serious criminals. And it is widely known that the Cica will reduce or refuse an award if the applicant is himself at fault \u2013 whether he has a previous conviction or not. Ken Clarke&apos;s proposal appears to make it mandatory to refuse awards, which is a step too far. This article was amended at 3.40pm on January 30 2012 to correct the paragraph reference to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme and to make it clear that Cica must (rather than can) refuse an award if it finds evidence of bad character", "sentences": ["Or imagine a 20-year old student who is caught returning from Amsterdam with cannabis in her rucksack."], "title": "Dangerous, vindictive and unnecessary | Daniel Barnett", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jan/30/criminal-compensation-reforms-dangerous", "tags": ["UK criminal justice", "Law", "Crime", "UK news", "Kenneth Clarke", "Politics", "Legal aid"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-01-30T16:17:40Z", "article": "In around 1653, the Dutch artist Willem Kalf painted a lobster. First he arranged it with various other delicacies and luxuries on a tabletop, ready to be carefully observed and copied on to canvas. The boiled crustacean was placed on a platter on top of a ruffled cloth, with a peeled lemon and a twinkling glass nearby. Over the tempting snack stands a spectacular buffalo drinking horn, embellished with silver. Kalf&apos;s painting is a monument to luxury. This is not a depiction of a proletarian meal. Vincent van Gogh&apos;s much later work The Potato Eaters might be seen as a critical riposte to this and other 17th-century Dutch still lives of delicious feasts and snacks. While Vincent was trying to portray the lives of the desperate, Kalf entertained the well-off. The people who paid for paintings like his could surely also afford the actual lobster and the real drinking horn. (The drinking horn is believed to be associated with an Amsterdam archers&apos; guild, so perhaps this was commissioned for an officer in what was in effect an elite social club.) I started thinking about luxury in art this morning after reading the Guardian&apos;s readers&apos; editor on questions about newspaper coverage of food, fashion and gadgets. In times of austerity, should journalists be reviewing the finer things in life \u2013 or ignoring them? Art has an answer. For centuries, painters have depicted the pleasures of food and fashion. And in all that time, not one painting has been eaten or worn (I hope not, anyway). Kalf may have painted his still life for a wealthy merchant, but today anyone can see it, for free, in the National Gallery in London. When we look at it, are we aware of looking at money, at luxury? Do we feel bloated or envious? Of course not. We look at the glitter of the paint, where Kalf has captured the translucent sheen of glass, at the curving brightness of his lemon peel, the rugged texture of the woven fabric. Up close, dazzling flecks of colour create form. The desirability of depicted objects becomes the self-contained pleasure of paint; the eye replaces all other sensory organs. Still life is endlessly enigmatic; it is at once a hymn to the physical world and an ethereal replacement of it. Kalf tempts us with what is not there. The lobster was eaten centuries ago. In art, it endures as a frozen feast of redness. In art, thinking about luxury is not the same as grasping it. Art can imagine everything from a feast to a fast \u2013 and yet it is always an idea, an image. This is not confined to artists: it is an aspect of how people think about food and fashion \u2013 we don&apos;t necessarily leap from thought to action. Fashion fans do not all have the money to purchase everything or anything they see in a magazine, any more than an art lover has to have the clothes they see on a fabulously dressed person in a portrait. Fantasy is part of looking and thinking. Leave it to clergymen to blame society&apos;s ills on images of the unattainable. Imagining luxury is as human as imagining want. The real ugliness of the age of austerity would be to limit innocent pleasures, to force misery on the modern mind. It&apos;s bad economics (someone has to buy some stuff if the economy is to grow), and it&apos;s hopeless human psychology. You can&apos;t impose austerity on the imagination.", "sentences": ["(The drinking horn is believed to be associated with an Amsterdam archers&apos; guild, so perhaps this was commissioned for an officer in what was in effect an elite social club.)"], "title": "Should art be austere in a recession?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/jan/30/art-austere-recession-willem-kalf", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-02T15:36:01Z", "article": "Alex Needham&apos;s excellent piece on contemporary classical music did a great job of identifying a widespread growth in listener interest in the genre. This trend is not only a bona fide artistic renaissance, but encouraging news for all who invest in music and musicians. We&apos;re currently seeing a melding of genres and a breaking of boundaries across the music world. This recent trend \u2013 listeners moving to the avant garde after they start demanding more from the mainstream\u2013 has long been acknowledged within pop. In recent years, mainstream pop artists have even started adopting aspects of the avant garde in their search for fresh output: it&apos;s a dialogue that has benefited artists, labels and listeners alike. Up until now the implications for former &quot;niche&quot; genres \u2013 classical, jazz, world \u2013 have been largely overlooked. In a world where listeners no longer define themselves along firm genre lines, music is increasingly just that \u2013 music. As a result, we are now witnessing a musician-led movement gleefully adopted by listeners, in which classical is being rebranded from the ground up. Even the term &quot;classical&quot; itself seems obsolete in the face of what&apos;s being produced and consumed. A record company works best when it anticipates nascent appetites among the musical public, moves itself into a space where it can tap into them, and uses its influence and resources to nourish them. This trend is no exception. The business must adapt their promotion, their artists and repertoire and their very understanding of classical music in order to capitalise on it, and develop the spirit of change. What&apos;s needed is a total collaboration between the mainstream music industry and the classical world at every level, from label to artist to administrator to critic. The industry must find the confidence to put its weight and its wallet behind major projects and artists, while the classical world needs to abandon old attitudes and collaborate artistically, opening its doors to legions of new fans. Last autumn, Universal Music gathered together a loose thinktank of industry figures, creative and business minds; new projects, ideas and relationships are still springing from this catalyst months later. The ideas being discussed include promoting events and concerts in unusual venues that offer a different kind of experience, including atmospheric lighting and screens. The iTunes festival at the Roundhouse is one such event, and the Yellow Lounge club nights, which are being promoted in Berlin, London and Amsterdam, are other good examples. Wouldn&apos;t it be exciting to go to an orchestral concert and rather than look at the conductor&apos;s back, be able to see his face on screens? Or have her talk to the audience about the music that is being performed? We are also convinced there is space for a Hay on Wye-style classical music festival. We have ideas for even more collaboration with TV channels like the BBC and Sky Arts. Perhaps most crucially, young musicians need to be involved in the presentation of their music at a higher and deeper level. When Alice Sara Ott performed at the London edition of the Yellow Lounge last December, she talked to the crowd about what she was playing and what inspired her. You could feel the bond between performer and audience grow as she spoke. The industry is in an unprecedented position to broker actual sea change, which should remain in place for generations. It&apos;s an amazing time to be making classical music, whether in the concert hall or from the boardroom, all that&apos;s needed is acknowledgment of this at the highest levels. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "sentences": ["The iTunes festival at the Roundhouse is one such event, and the Yellow Lounge club nights, which are being promoted in Berlin, London and Amsterdam, are other good examples."], "title": "What the music industry needs to do with the classical renaissance | Max Hole", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/02/classical-renaissance-music-industry", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Music industry"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-02T21:23:16Z", "article": "More than 120 cold-related deaths have been reported across eastern Europe, many among homeless people, and at least 11,000 people are trapped by heavy snow in mountain villages in Serbia.

The producer George Martin, who commissioned them, praised both songs for their &quot;clever lyrics and quirky melodies, which hung together so neatly, leaving plenty of space for us to create a sound picture. All we had to do was add the right sound effects and musical arrangements.&quot; Dicks also wrote television scripts and theme songs for films and television, including the cult children&apos;s series Catweazle (1970-71). He was born in north London, the son of a postal worker, Fred Dicks, and his wife, Violet. He attended Hornsey School of Art before being called up for national service. Following his two years in the RAF, Dicks won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art. There, he made a lifelong friend in the future novelist Len Deighton and they put on entertainments together. Although his art took second place to his music, Dicks continued to paint throughout his life and sold many canvases. In the mid-1950s, Dicks taught in a school and joined the amateur Mountview theatre club in north London, where he composed his first show, Let&apos;s Go Mad, renamed Look Who&apos;s Here! when it was given a short run in the West End in 1960. Dicks went on to write with Barry Cryer, including material for a show starring Danny La Rue. His breakthrough came when he joined forces with the actor and lyric writer Myles Rudge. Dicks saw Rudge on stage in Julian Slade&apos;s Salad Days and the duo wrote the revue And Another Thing together in 1960. It featured Anna Quayle, Lionel and Joyce Blair and Bernard Cribbins. After touring the provinces, And Another Thing had a lengthy run at the Fortune theatre in London. Martin saw the show and decided to record Folk Song, a satirical number performed by Cribbins. It sold enough copies for Martin to commission more material for Cribbins from Dicks and Rudge. Both The Hole in the Ground and Right, Said Fred were top 10 hits in 1962. The latter, the tale of an impossible task for a trio of removal men, was inspired by the delivery of a piano to Dicks. His and Rudge&apos;s only subsequent hit was A Windmill in Old Amsterdam for Ronnie Hilton in 1965, but their songs were also recorded by Topol, Jim Dale, Joan Sims, Petula Clark (The Happiest Christmas) and Val Doonican (the children&apos;s song Annabelle). In 1966, the Dicks-Rudge romantic ballad Other People was the B-side of Matt Monro&apos;s hit Born Free and brought the authors considerable royalties. In 1967, the duo created an album of songs for Kenneth Williams, On Pleasure Bent. Two years later, Dicks provided the music for new songs used in the TV series Cribbins. He also wrote film theme songs with the actor and producer Hazel Adair, for whom he had written scripts for the soap operas Compact and Crossroads. His final collaboration with Rudge was a musical, Strip, about characters in a daily newspaper cartoon. It was commissioned for the Belgrade theatre, Coventry in the early 1970s, but never staged.

They argue the agency is obliged to work with Marchildon &quot;as she looked in the final&quot;, rather than retrospectively forcing her to conform to their rules. The case has started a debate in the Netherlands about the extent to which young women are expected to adhere to near-impossible physical standards. Dieuwke Levinson-Arps, who is representing Marchildon, claims her client was told by a lawyer working for Elite that she was sacked because &quot;although she has a nice face, she has a fat arse&quot; and that &quot;she never had it in her to become a top model because she was unsuitable for catwalk work&quot;. She said Marchildon&apos;s physiology meant she had &quot;no chance&quot; of having 90cm hips, even with a strict diet and exercise regime. &quot;Already she was very skinny, almost anorexically skinny,&quot; said Levinson-Arps. In the two years after winning the show, Marchildon received around 20 assignments for Elite, mostly in print advertisements. She did not get any catwalk offers. Marchildon is suing Elite for unfair dismissal. She wants them to pay out the remaining \u20ac65,000 she says she was promised for winning the show. Elite is contesting the claim. Wikke Kootstra, a lawyer for Elite, said: &quot;It was impossible for Elite to find [Marchildon] modelling jobs since she wasn&apos;t in the required shape.&quot; Asked about the reason for a preferred hip measurement of 90cm, Kootstra said in an email: &quot;Elite models model couture. Couture clothing is made in one size only: (tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s) petite. This is not something modelling agencies can change. (I imagine they would welcome such a change since it would make their job so much easier \u2026 but it is not in their power to change what the market dictates.) &quot;Hip measurements are not the only criterium for the possibility to find suitable jobs for a model; they have to be in excellent trim and take extremely good care of their appearances, eat right, sleep well, exercise etc. It&apos;s not for everybody.&quot; Kootstra said Elite never signed a contract with Marchildon. After winning the show she was given a contract with another modelling agency, MTA. She was then placed with the higher-profile Elite agency, said Kootstra, &quot;as is customary in the modelling world, to obtain maximal exposure&quot;. To support their case, Marchildon&apos;s legal team wrote to Tyra Banks, the American supermodel who owns the rights to the Next Top Model brand, saying the incident &quot;exploits&quot; and &quot;grossly neglects&quot; the character of Banks&apos;s original format. Banks does not appear to have received the letter as it was subsequently returned unopened. Banks has been outspoken about her own weight fluctuations since tabloids ran an unflattering photograph of her in a bathing suit under headlines such as: &quot;America&apos;s Next Top Waddle&quot; and &quot;Tyra Porkchop&quot;. In March last year a beauty queen in Texas won a case against the pageant&apos;s organisers who stripped her of her crown after she allegedly put on weight.

Casually dressed for the weekend, he is a slender man in his early 30s with a fashionable haircut. He orders pasta. &quot;When I travel to New York, I am always struck by the percentage of Caucasians in the banks there. Here in Tokyo it&apos;s overwhelmingly Japanese. But in London you have the whole world population represented. I may go to a desk in a major bank and not find a single English person on the team. They may be from India, from Lebanon, from anywhere. That&apos;s London. &quot;My job is in corporate banking. I am the liaison between my bank and one major global Japanese company. Let&apos;s call that company XYZ. Now XYZ has operations around the globe. It buys materials and half-products from lots of countries. It assembles and manufactures in lots of countries. It sells its own products across the globe. &quot;Imagine the money flows: across currencies, across time zones, across jurisdictions. Say XYZ wants to buy a factory in China. For tax reasons XYZ may have its &apos;paper headquarters&apos; in a tax-haven like London, Amsterdam or Switzerland. This means that the payment has to go through there. So it starts in yen in Japan, is converted into sterling or Swiss francs or euros to originate in the country of the paper headquarters. Then it must be converted into dollars because Chinese renminbi must be paid for in this way. So the payment alone moves through four currencies, but at what conversion rate? You have different currency markets operating in different time zones. The yen market closes before the London market opens. On what day should the transaction be credited? How does the transaction look to different regulatory systems in the countries concerned? &quot;You need to agree on a fee for all this, provide certification \u2026 In a transaction like this there may be at least three other banks involved. And don&apos;t forget the need for &apos;local information&apos;. In some countries official regulation can be quite different from how things are done in practice. I need to be aware of that and pass on relevant information to XYZ. &quot;This is just one example and you understand how global financial transactions get very complicated very quickly. And how a bank with global operations is at a huge advantage. When Japanese corporations expand overseas they cannot do so using Japanese banks as these lack such global networks. This is not good for Japan and we must work harder to change it. Japanese corporations could do more, too. I know of Japanese executives who take an English course but quit very soon; they decide they are just going to take an interpreter to wherever they are going. &quot;My day starts before 7am when I wake up and check my BlackBerry. It doesn&apos;t really matter where I am to do work. My office phone is routed to my BlackBerry so it looks as if I am speaking from the office. On the commute I read stuff and work from the BlackBerry. I need to know what has happened while I was asleep, both in the world and with XYZ. Say there has been a flood in Thailand. Has that affected operations for the local XYZ activities? &quot;On a normal morning there are between 50 and 100 emails to go through. I usually get into the office around 9am and work till midnight, till just before the last train. Working hours often shift. When the XYZ office with which I am doing business is in a completely different time zone, you need to adapt your hours. &quot;For example, European banks are currently withdrawing from Latin America, because the crisis forces them to retrench. So I may get a call from the XYZ office in Brazil that they can no longer get a credit-line from their European bank. Can we support them? I get on the phone with the XYZ office in Brazil and in Tokyo, and with our local office in Brazil as well as with the people in our bank here in Tokyo who are responsible for Latin America. &quot;What it comes down to is client maintenance. Any request from XYZ headquarters here in Tokyo or a local subsidiary goes to me. I speak to my counterparts every day about activities, needs, demands, strategy \u2026 Co-ordination is key. &quot;There are interesting parallels between Japan and the UK. Both are islands with a limited and stable population. They have their own currency and they are a former power with lots of history. Their banks and corporations now make most of their profits overseas, which they repatriate for tax reasons. &quot;London is still the financial centre for the Europe and Mediterranean region. It helps how countries like India and other former British colonies have adopted many of the British laws, rules and regulations. That is of great benefit to London. &quot;Yet it&apos;s unclear where London is going, what the regulatory climate is going to be. Also, I don&apos;t see much innovation coming out of the UK these days. The bankers&apos; population may be very diverse. The products they come up with are rather old-fashioned.&quot; \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "sentences": ["For tax reasons XYZ may have its &apos;paper headquarters&apos; in a tax-haven like London, Amsterdam or Switzerland."], "title": "Corporate banker in Japan: 'I don't see much innovation coming out of the UK' | Joris Luyendijk", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/feb/05/voices-of-finance-vice-president-bank-tokyo", "tags": ["Japan", "UK news", "World news", "Financial sector", "Work & careers", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-07T08:00:01Z", "article": "For reasons unconnected to this blog I was in Japan recently, where I had the chance to speak to three people working in finance in Tokyo. They had such interesting things to say that I thought it would be a shame not to share them here. Please consider this a snapshot \u2013 no more, no less \u2013 of some of the differences and similarities between finance in Japan and in the west. It would be wonderful if readers, Japanese or not, with relevant knowledge used the comment thread to jump in and elaborate. The big story in Japan these days still seems to be the tsunami and the nuclear disaster that followed at Fukushima, sometimes referred to as 3/11. It is hard to miss the parallels between the nuclear crisis in Japan and the banking crisis in the west. Not only are they often described with the same term, &quot;meltdown&quot;, the context is strikingly similar. In both cases you have a crucial part of the country&apos;s infrastructure that is very complex and nearly incomprehensible to outsiders. It was consistently portrayed as safe by experts and the authorities. Then it blew up. I met a number of Japanese journalists who were very distrustful of their government&apos;s statements and promises about nuclear safety. Pervading their words was a sense that the political class was not on the side of the people, but in cahoots with the sector. Again a clear parallel with the west. One Japanese banker, who sat for an interview similar to others posted on this blog, works in equity finance for a major western bank. He said: &quot;There is no real anger at bankers in Japan these days. I don&apos;t hide from people that I work in a bank,&quot; adding: &quot;We don&apos;t have Occupy tents in Tokyo. When there are demonstrations they are anti-nuclear, not anti-finance, at least for now. The financial crisis had affected Japanese banks in a markedly different way, he continued. &quot;It&apos;s the world in reverse these days. In the 90s it was Japanese banks that had to sell many of those non-performing loans [bad sub-prime loans] to western banks \u2013 often at great profit for those western banks. These days, Japanese banks can make good money by buying bad loans at big discounts from distressed western banks.&quot; It was very interesting to see how the mores of the financial sector intersect with local customs in Japan, upending some while amplifying others. An investment banker explained how she ended up in finance, at least for a while. She had gone to study abroad, thinking this would improve her CV only to discover on her return that she had missed several rounds in the incredibly rigid recruiting system in Japan. &quot;Recruitment in Japan is like a train,&quot; she said. &quot;You fail to get on and you&apos;re lost.&quot; There was one sector left in which such rules did not apply; finance. The equity finance banker said: &quot;We work even longer hours than bankers in London do. Tokyo is a very competitive market because you have all the banks you have in London or New York, but there are also the Japanese giants for whom this is their home turf. Then there&apos;s the investment bank mentality of working long hours. Add to that the Japanese work mentality and you begin to understand why we sometimes joke that our job is 9 to 5; 9am to 5am.&quot; The full interview with the equity finance banker is here, and especially worth a read if you do not know what equity finance is, or &quot;Chinese walls&quot;. The other person to sit for a formal interview was in corporate banking; he worked for a major western bank in charge of liaison with one of the biggest Japanese corporations. I had not yet spoken to a corporate banker for this blog, and was struck by just how complex the daily operations of major corporations have become in today&apos;s global economy. Let&apos;s call&quot;&apos;my&quot; corporation XYZ, the corporate banker said: &quot;Now XYZ has operations around the globe. It buys materials and half-products from lots of countries. It assembles and manufactures in lots of countries. It sells its own products across the globe. &quot;Imagine the money flows: across currencies, across time zones, across jurisdictions. Say XYZ wants to buy a factory in China. For tax reasons XYZ may have its &apos;paper headquarters&apos; [registered office] in a haven like London, Amsterdam or Switzerland. This means that the payment has to go through there. So it starts in yen in Japan, is converted into sterling, Swiss franks or euros to originate in the country of the paper headquarters. Then it must be converted into dollars because Chinese renminbi must be paid for in dollars. So the payment alone moves through four currencies, but at what conversion rate?

I need to be aware of that and pass on relevant information to XYZ. This must be one of the reasons that today&apos;s financial sector is not a free market but an oligopoly of a handful of banks; scale is everything and the barriers to entry for newcomers are huge. The corporate banker elaborated: &quot;A bank with global operations is at a huge advantage. When Japanese corporations expand overseas, they cannot do so using Japanese banks as these lack such global networks.&quot; This was actually a joint interview. There we were, a Dutchman and two Japanese men speaking in English about the global world of finance. One was eating pasta and the other a curry, while I was digging into my Japanese dish. It occurred to me that in many ways I had more in common with them than I had with many of the Dutch people who are supposed to form &quot;my culture&quot;. The corporate banker said: &quot;When I travel to New York, I am always struck by the percentage of white Caucasians in the banks there. Here in Tokyo it&apos;s overwhelmingly Japanese.

In 2008 the pair were given the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYs, something akin to an American Sports Personality of the Year awards. Carlos\u2019s own autobiography followed last October. This, now, is their life, full of speaking engagements and interviews, publicity and publication, applause and acclaim. In the moments before the medal ceremony in Mexico City, Carlos, Smith \u2013 as of a few moments earlier the 200 metres world record-holder \u2013 and the Australian silver-medallist Peter Norman sat in a room the athletes called \u201cthe dungeon\u201d, deep in the bowels of the Olympic Stadium. As they prepared, they discussed what was about to happen. One of the things mentioned was the possibility of them being murdered on the spot. \u201cI remember telling Mr Smith: \u2018Remember when we get out there, we\u2019ve been trained as runners to listen to the gun,\u2019\u201d Carlos has said. \u201c\u2019So when we get out there and do what we do, if the hammer hits that bullet, hit the deck. Don\u2019t be just a duck on the table for them to just shoot at.\u2019\u201d Whose idea was the raised fist? With depressing inevitability, both athletes have claimed it. According to Carlos, just before the final he suggested it to Smith: \u201cI\u2019m going to do something on the stand to let those in power know they\u2019re wrong. I want you with me.\u201d He even claimed to have deliberately lost the race, because \u201cTommie Smith would have never put his fist in the sky had I won\u201d. But if this were true, why would Smith by then have procured the pair of black gloves the pair famously go on to share? Smith, meanwhile, recalled: \u201cI told John what I was planning to do. I said: \u2018You don\u2019t have to do anything that I do, but this is what I\u2019m going to do. Just follow my lead.\u2019\u201d These competing claims caused the pair to fall out for several years, but more recently Carlos has stated that the protest had been planned by the two athletes together over a period of days. What is currently agreed on is this: they wore gloves to represent black America, and removed their shoes and wore black socks to symbolise the poverty of the American black community. Smith wore a scarf and Carlos a bead necklace, recalling lynching. Both Americans wore the badge of the Olympic Project for Human Rights, and they planned to raise their gloved fists, which according to Smith at the time \u201cstood for the power in black America\u201d. Norman recalled those moments in \u201cthe dungeon\u201d thus: \u201cThey involved me in the conversation. It wasn\u2019t a secret huddle, they were letting me know. It was my suggestion that they split Tommie\u2019s gloves because John had left his back in his room. [Then] I said to John: \u2018You got another one of those badges?\u2019 \u2018If I get you one, will you wear it?\u2019 he asked. \u2018I sure would,\u2019 I replied.\u201d Neither Smith nor Carlos had a spare badge, but as they walked into the light of the stadium they saw Paul Hoffman, a (white) member of the US rowing team and OPHR activist. \u201cI was wearing my badge and he came up and said: \u2018Hey mate, you got another one of those?\u2019 So here\u2019s this white Australian, with two black Americans, who wants to wear an OPHR badge, and I was damned if I was going to be the one who says he can\u2019t,\u201d Hoffman told the BBC (in the excellent documentary Black Power Salute, which you can currently see here). \u201cSo I took mine off and handed it to him.\u201d They reached the podium, where a rather bemused Lord Burghley, the sixth marquis of Essex \u2013 a Conservative politician and International Olympic Committee member who 40 years earlier had won gold in Amsterdam in the 400m hurdles \u2013 placed their medals around their necks. When asked later what he had thought of the gloves, he said: \u201cI thought they had hurt their hand.\u201d The anthem started. Smith and Carlos thrust their fists in the air. Different people recall the reaction within the stadium very differently: Time magazine reported that \u201ca wave of boos rippled through the spectators\u201d, but Newsweek describes simply a \u201cmurmur [that] rippled through the stadium\u201d, and in the New York Times it is reported that the protest \u201cactually passed without much general notice\u201d. What is certain is that for everybody involved, life was about to change for ever. If San Jose\u2019s brilliant sprinting coach, Lloyd \u201cBud\u201d Winter, was responsible for them reaching the podium, another member of the university\u2019s staff was largely responsible for what they did there: Harry Edwards, the inspirational young sociology professor and creator of the OPHR, had done much to politicise the pair \u2013 particularly Smith, by nature more reserved and less militant than his fellow medallist. Edwards had originally advocated a black boycott of the Games. \u201cFor years we have carried the United States on our backs with our victories, and race relations are now worse than ever,\u201d he had told the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the black people to stand up as men and women and refuse to be utilised as performing animals for a little extra dog food.\u201d The boycott was also supported by Martin Luther King, who had met Edwards and several athletes including Carlos in New York a few days before he was assassinated in April that year. \u201cI would like to commend the outstanding athletes who have the courage and determination to make it clear that they will not participate in the 1968 Olympics until something is done about these terrible evils and injustices,\u201d he said. But many black athletes were keen to compete in Mexico, and when South Africa and Rhodesia were disinvited from the Games \u2013 one of the OPHR\u2019s three main demands \u2013 the boycott plan was dropped. Other ideas swiftly took its place, and at the US trials a few weeks before the Games, officials were warned to \u201cexpect almost anything\u201d. So immediately after Smith and Carlos made their stand a statement was released which stated: \u201cUS Olympic officials knew they planned to do it,\u201d and that they \u201cdid not expect to take any action\u201d. But then Avery Brundage got involved. Brundage was the IOC\u2019s president from 1952 to 1972, and he was also an antisemite, white supremacist and Nazi sympathiser, whom the athletes preferred to call \u201cSlavery Avery\u201d. His removal from office had been one of the OPHR\u2019s other key demands. His pet hate \u2013 ironically, given his active involvement in the 1936 Games in Berlin, which became a propaganda exercise for the Nazi party \u2013 was the use of sport for political or nationalistic ends. He detested and did his best to ban medal tables, and in 1964 came close to passing a motion that would have denied Smith and Carlos their memorable moment, by ending the raising of national flags and the playing of anthems at medal ceremonies and replacing them with the Olympic flag and \u201ca fanfare of trumpets\u201d. He might have been presenting the medals himself that day, had he not been in Acapulco watching the sailing (the original purpose of the gloves, according to Carlos, was as protection in case they were required to shake his hand). But Brundage had seen the ceremony, and he was mad as hell. The IOC criticised Smith and Carlos for \u201cadvertising their domestic political views\u201d, which amounted to \u201ca deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the Olympic spirit\u201d. The US Olympic Committee, threatened with the expulsion of its entire team unless action was taken, suddenly changed its tune, putting out a second statement apologising for an act of \u201cuntypical exhibitionism ... which violates the basic standards of sportsmanship and good manners which are so highly regarded in the United States\u201d. Smith and Carlos were given 48 hours to pack their bags and leave the country. Hoffman, for the crime of lending Norman his badge, was very nearly expelled as well, and got away with it only because his father was a judge and a personal friend of many American officials. The protest had not been much better received back home. \u201c\u2019Faster, Higher, Stronger\u2019 is the motto of the Olympic Games. \u2018Angrier, nastier, uglier\u2019 better describes the scene in Mexico City last week,\u201d reported Time, describing the protest as \u201ca public display of petulance that sparked one of the most unpleasant controversies in Olympic history\u201d. Associated Press called it \u201ca bizarre demonstration\u201d. One of few voices of support from white America came from Robert Clark, the enlightened president of San Jose State, who praised them as \u201chonourable young men dedicated to the cause of justice for the Black people in our society\u201d. Back in Mexico City, Jesse Owens was sent to talk black athletes out of staging similar protests (though he was ignored, and considered a white apologist by many). They were told \u201cA repetition of such incidents ... would warrant the imposition of the severest penalties at the disposal of the US Olympic Committee.\u201d But protests of varying degrees of subtlety abounded. After a black American clean sweep in the men\u2019s 400m, won by Lee Evans, another student of Edwards at San Jose State, all three athletes wore berets to their medal ceremony. Long-jump gold-medallist Bob Beamon wore black socks pulled up high, while the bronze-medallist, Ralph Boston, went barefoot. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to send me home, too,\u201d he said. They did not. The women\u2019s 4x100m relay team publicly dedicated their own gold medals to Carlos and Smith. (But another athlete, the heavyweight boxer George Foreman, who claims he \u201cthought about going home myself\u201d in solidarity after Smith and Carlos were expelled, then celebrated his own gold medal by waving a little American flag in the ring. He was castigated in the black community. \u201cI felt what I did was right, and I think they appreciate me more for doing what I think was right than following what they think was right,\u201d Foreman said the following month. In his autobiography Smith says Foreman\u2019s flag-waving made him \u201cvery bitter, very angry\u201d.) What happened next? The BBC paid them $1,000 in cash for an exclusive interview. Will you not benefit from the notoriety and publicity the protest has generated, they were asked. \u201cI can\u2019t eat that,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cAnd the kids round my block can\u2019t eat it. They can\u2019t eat publicity, they can\u2019t eat gold medals. All they want is an equal chance to be a human being.\u201d The truth of this observation was clear after their return to America. After a near-violent scrum of reporters assaults them in Los Angeles, they board a second flight to San Jose. \u201cOnce we got back we were ostracised, even by our own,\u201d Smith said. \u201cFolks were scared, man. No jobs. We couldn\u2019t find work. People even told us, \u2018We can\u2019t get close to you guys because we have our own jobs to protect.\u2019 These were my friends. At least, they were my friends before I left for Mexico City.\u201d Smith\u2019s agent cancelled their contract, and Smith was sacked from his job washing cars. Within two years his mother had died, his marriage was over, and he was unemployed and broke. \u201cMy mother died of a heart attack in 1970 as a result of pressure delivered to her from farmers who sent her manure and dead rats in the mail because of me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy brothers in high school were kicked off the football team, my brother in Oregon had his scholarship taken away.\u201d Carlos fared little better. \u201cI came back \u2018John Carlos the neighbourhood bum\u2019,\u201d he has said. \u201cI would soon have no money and I had to beg, borrow, steal and gamble to pay my rent. I remember chopping the furniture up for firewood and my wife looking at me as if I was crazy. But our heating was electric and I couldn\u2019t pay my electricity bill, so we had to take the kids to sleep by the fireplace.\u201d His wife left him, and in 1977 she took her own life. \u201cI lost my first wife in this thing. But I\u2019ll never be bitter toward anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cNot for the criticisms or the death threats or anything. If I\u2019m bitter, they win.\u201d Peter Norman\u2019s time of 20.06 remains an Australian record, and would have won the gold medal in two of the past three Olympics. He continued to race, competing in the 1970 Commonwealth Games, but even though he comfortably reached qualifying standards in 1972 for both the 100m and 200m, for which he was at the time ranked No5 in the world, he was not selected, and Australia travelled to Munich with no sprinters at all. When the Olympics were held in Sydney in 2000 notable Australian former medallists were invited to take part in a ceremony at the Olympic Stadium; Norman was not among them. He made it to the stadium only after officials from US Track &amp; Field heard of their plight and stepped in. \u201cThey treated us like royalty,\u201d said his second wife, Jan (his first marriage also failed after 1968). When Norman died in 2006, Smith and Carlos acted as pallbearers. \u201cHe didn\u2019t raise his fist,\u201d Smith said, \u201cbut he did lend a hand.\u201d The redemption of Smith and Carlos started in 1983, when the president of the organising committee of the Los Angeles Games, Peter Ueberroth, hired Carlos as special consultant on minority affairs. Ueberroth personally handled the resulting storm of protest, but Carlos\u2019s work was later seen as one of the key factors behind the success of the Games. Looking back at the bad times, Carlos has said: \u201cIf I\u2019ve got to take a whuppin\u2019 for something I believe in, I\u2019ll take that whuppin\u2019.\u201d What the Guardian said: 18 October 1968 Although every athletics expert was aware that the United States Negro athletes might protest, the manner of it surprised many in the Olympic Stadium here last night. It was more restrained and yet more effective than some had thought. There was the possibility that Tommie Smith or John Carlos, overwhelming favourites for the sprint events, might refuse to appear at the medals ceremony. In fact, both showed a keen awareness of the publicity values involved, and their appearance in black socks and black scarves, and each with a single black glove, Smith\u2019s on the right hand, Carlos\u2019s on the left, showed a knowledge of public relations equalled only by Cassius Clay, now Muhammad Ali.   Related: US men's volleyball has no pro league \u2013 but it has its eye on Olympic gold    At the press conference afterwards, the same awareness was apparent. The representatives of the world\u2019s press crowded into a room perhaps 40 feet by 30. The organisation insisted that questions and replies were put in English, Spanish and French. International press conferences usually begin with pussy-footing questions of remarkable banality. The first question to Carlos was why he looked over his left shoulder and whether it cost him second place \u2013 a good technical question but utterly remote from the emotional context of the occasion ... Questions concerning which coach had meant most to Smith were hooted off court by all except the conscientious interpreters. Finally Carlos lost patience and burst out with the statement: \u201cWe are black and we are proud to be black in white America.\u201d Black Americans, he said, would understand the nature of their demonstration. \u201cWe are not a show horse doing a performance, so if we do a good job we get paid some peanuts. All through these Olympics I hear them say \u2018Boy, boy, boy, you\u2019re doing well.\u2019 I am tired of that. I want the whole press of the world to hear what I say and either say it as I say it or not say it at all.\u201d ... The US team officials were obviously left with a problem. What, if any, disciplinary action would be taken. \u201cI\u2019d pack them all back home,\u201d one British official said trenchantly. He perhaps has no White House to deal with.

A few months. I stopped shaving and discovered I was more popular. Maybe people can&apos;t see my ordinary, rather dour facial expressions as easily and so they don&apos;t seem to think I&apos;m the total jerk they seemed to think I was before. You said your new single Andrew in Drag is (1) autobiographical \u2013 in what way? I write a lot of songs about unrequited love because I&apos;m very, very familiar with unrequited love, both as a lyrical theme and coincidentally in my own life \u2013 which is a good thing because it provides lots of material. Speaking of unrequited love, you posed naked for Butt magazine (2). Did it have any effect on your love life? It complicated the relationship I was about to have, but once we convinced him it had been taken months before, it was less complicating. There&apos;s a song on the album (3) called God Wants Us to Wait. Have you ever encountered anyone who told you that? If you Google &quot;God wants us to wait&quot; there are whole websites about so-called abstinence education \u2013 as if one has to be taught how to not have sex. I went to elementary school partly in Boston, which is a very Catholic town, and there was a lot of talk about abstinence and guilt. Obviously it didn&apos;t have much effect on you. It&apos;s actually a complicated issue for me because while I detest Christianity and think ethics are bunk, I also realise Aids more or less destroyed the argument that we should all fuck like bunnies in the street and that anyone who says otherwise is a moron. While it is true, obviously, that we should fuck like bunnies in the street, we need to be wearing the proper clothing while doing so. Anyway, it&apos;s a complex situation easily satirised with stupid but fun little songs such as God Wants Us to Wait. I remember a few years ago in the Guide, Damon Albarn saying with great self-satisfaction that he&apos;d written a Chinese opera (4). But you&apos;ve written three (5). Does that mean you&apos;re three times as talented? I write them in my sleep. We were doing it with the same director as him \u2013 Chen Shi-Zheng (6). Did you get gossip? I did! Not that I&apos;m willing to share. Why are the songs on this album so short? All songs should be short. They&apos;re only a little shorter than they are on 69 Love Songs (7). This is an average of 2:15 and 69 Love Songs is an average of 2:40. Do you ever worry that 69 Love Songs overshadows everything else you do? The whole point was to make it a career-defining move, so I can&apos;t complain. I knew we were going to have a big backlash immediately afterwards, so i (8) was written knowing no one would ever prefer it to 69 Love Songs, or even pretend to. So I will spend the rest of my life living down 69 Love Songs, just as I planned to. It&apos;s fine. It must be gratifying that a lot of people cite it as their favourite album ever. I&apos;m not aware of these people, but I applaud them. How&apos;s your chihuahua, Irving Berlin? He&apos;s 12. The average chihuahua lifespan is 13 years so he&apos;s going a bit deaf, which is actually convenient for him. Now he can only bark at the neighbours if he sees them. Do you think there are any misconceptions about your music? One of them is that in Germany they have no tradition of the ukelele. German journalists don&apos;t recognise the sound of a ukelele \u2013 they hear it as a badly recorded guitar. All German journalists think the Magnetic Fields are literally low fidelity \u2013 not lo-fi the genre, but literally very badly recorded and out of tune. Will you vote for Obama again? I didn&apos;t vote for Obama in the first place. I didn&apos;t vote at all in that election \u2013 I wasn&apos;t there. But anyway, I want to keep my passport so I don&apos;t reveal my actual political leanings in the national press of any English-speaking country. Are you staying in this hotel (9) for its proximity to Tate Britain or the discos of Vauxhall? Neither \u2013 I&apos;m hanging out at the King&apos;s Arms in Soho. That&apos;s the bears&apos; pub. Are you a bear (10) now? I&apos;m not big enough to be considered a bear, except if you believe in the phrase &quot;pocket bear&quot;, which I&apos;m not really comfortable with. Like a koala. No, koala&apos;s something else \u2013 Australian bear. Many of my friends are bear or post-bear, like my friend LD Beghtol who sang on 69 Love Songs. He&apos;s had a big, bushy beard for decades and considers himself post-bear. What do you do if you&apos;re post-bear? You&apos;re beyond all that now.

I like it here and now I want to give something back. I have therefore decided to solve one of the UK&apos;s pressing problems. Here&apos;s the plan in four easy steps. First thing tomorrow morning I am going to the Bank of England to tell them I am starting my own bank. This ought not to be too difficult. Free market theory tells us that barriers to entry in a market must be low so new participants are encouraged to enter. If a baker on Baker Street is making huge profits, others should be able to open up bakeries in the area. This increases competition and rewards efficiency, driving down prices and benefiting consumers. Finance sits at the apex of this free market system, so surely they&apos;ll let me in. All the more so because as chief executive of my bank I will not engage in any, repeat any, risky activities. That&apos;s step two of the plan. Once established, my bank will simply go to the Bank of England and say: can you please give me lots of billions for your advertised rate of 0.5%? That&apos;s right. It took me a little while to get my mind around this, but some people in this wonderful country can do this. They have access to money that is almost free. These people are called the bankers. Soon I am going to be one of them. Now you may think that since they pretty much completely failed to foresee, let alone prevent the financial crisis, central bankers, such as those at the Bank of England, must be stupid and they will just hand me my billions, no questions asked. You would be wrong. People in central banks are actually incredibly learned and sophisticated, and they will want to know: where&apos;s your collateral? Who guarantees we are going to get all that money back? This is where step three kicks in. I will tell the Bank of England that I am taking all of those billions to the UK government and \u2026 lend it to them! What could be safer than investing my money in UK government bonds that are guaranteed by \u2026 the very same central bank that lends the money to me? These days the government can borrow from capital markets for a little over 2%, meaning I stand to make at least 1.5% for every billion they borrow from me. Nice work if you can get it! There are people in this country who get it. They are called the bankers. Soon I am going to be one of them. On to step four. This year alone the government is estimated by the BBC&apos;s Robert Peston to need to borrow about \u00a3260bn. If it does all its lending with my bank, I stand to make 1.5% of \u00a3260bn. That&apos;s \u00a33.9bn. This money I will then give back to \u2026 the UK government! At no charge! Simply as a token of my appreciation for your country&apos;s hospitality. Next year we&apos;ll do the same thing, and the year after that. Hell, the government may decide it wants to borrow even more from my bank, given that I charge only 0.5%. The sky is the limit when you are in a helicopter dumping freshly printed money from your window. Three point nine billion pounds involves a lot of zeros and one may ask why nobody thought of this before. My guess is that we have all been put to sleep by terms like &quot;historically low interest rates&quot;. I mean, who would not want those? Or take the words &quot;quantitative easing&quot;. Translated into everyday language they mean &quot;printing money and giving it to banks basically for free&quot;. But that&apos;s not at all how &quot;quantitative easing&quot; sounds. To an average person like me words that have &quot;quant&quot; in them reactivate a long-buried inferiority complex to do with maths. Anyone who hasn&apos;t tuned out after those intimidating four syllables then reads the soothing term &quot;easing&quot;. Who could be against that? \u2022 JorisLuyendijk replies to comments:     Joris Luyendijk banking blog Photograph: Guardian    Hi everyone, I must say that this piece is beginning to feel like the biggest fail of my blog so far. For one, some commenters seem to believe that I was actually planning to go to the Central Bank and tell them, look can you please give me lots of billions? Or were they being ironic and did I miss it?The reader is king so if the tone I intended has failed to come across, it must be my fault. Worse, I am actually more confused than I was when I was writing this piece. An autopsy: I should have left out any mentioning of QE. It&apos;s not necessary for the plan in four easy steps - which of course in itself is impossible for the reasons outlined by some of the very helpful, though sometimes somewhat less than heartwarming commenters.What brought on the piece is this: as some commenters pointed out, it feels like the Central Bank in a country creates money, which ends up with the banks, which they then lend to the government in that country, for a profit. That seemed material for satire. So I am with commenter Pragmatism who wrote:  I can&apos;t make up my mind whether this is brilliant or akin to one of those superficially alluring arguments that one equals zero.  Me neither. But I want to. So my proposal is that I am going to find someone who can explain in terms comprehensible to outsiders both QE and the Bank of England Base Rate.

The minute-long film shows commuters, students and beauticians indulging in dramatic game-like sequences, claiming to be part of a new world where play merges with real life.            The video will only be part of a multi-million-pound marketing onslaught set to herald the arrival of the console on 22 February. In the US, it has been reported that Sony will be spending an astonishing $50m (\u00a332m) on advertising for the device, which features a 5in OLED screen, front and back touchscreens, and online connectivity.  The trailer represents a shift in advertising direction, away from the handicraft imagery of many mid-period PS3 ads, and back to the movie-like bombast of the nineties. Indeed, the piece bears many similarities to the classic Double Life advert for the first PlayStation, which depicted a variety of normal people describing their alternate lives as gamers. Here it is:            The message, of course, is different. While the earlier advert was designed to recruit twenty-somethings into the emerging PlayStation &quot;lifestyle&quot;, the Vita version is about portability and social connection.

Karel Appel, a leading expressionist, died at 85 in 2006. He never recovered from the loss of a lifetime&apos;s worth of drawings, sketches, notebooks and other works believed to be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. The warehouse was bought by a UK storage and logistics company before Christmas and, in clearing out the contents, staff came across eight boxes filled with artworks. There was no documentation and it was not until a warehouse employee researched the name Karel Appel, whose notes and signatures appear on most of the works, that the company realised the boxes were worth more than mere salvage. Unaware of their real significance, but intrigued, a manager took some 30 drawings to Bonhams, the auctioneers, to be valued. To their astonishment, they were told that these were on the Art Loss Register&apos;s (ALR) computerised database of &quot;most wanted&quot; stolen art. Christopher Marinello, ALR&apos;s lawyer and chief negotiator, said: &quot;After five weeks of intense negotiation with the logistics company \u2026 a settlement was finally reached with the company agreeing to release their claim to the artwork.&quot; Appel was a painter, printmaker, sculptor and ceramist awarded the Unesco prize at the 1954 Venice Biennale. Represented in the Tate and other public collections, he was a leading member of the avant garde Cobra group (1948-51), particularly interested in the art of children. His paintings are admired for their thickly-painted, swirling depictions of grotesque animals and humans. Many of the stolen drawings were experimental ideas for works that Appel never realised. The collection had disappeared in 2002 en route from his studio to the newly created Karel Appel Foundation in Amsterdam. The loss was immediately reported to the police and the ALR. Marinello praised Bonhams for behaving responsibly. The ALR was appointed to represent Appel&apos;s heirs and the Foundation, who quickly confirmed their interest in recovering the works. The artist&apos;s widow, Harriet Appel, has identified the works. She said: &quot;I am extremely happy that the Karel Appel Foundation have recovered the lost drawings and am impressed by the successful and professional way in which this case was handled by the ALR.&quot; The foundation is particularly delighted as the missing drawings will now be added to &quot;a more correct and complete&quot; catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist&apos;s works on paper. The logistics company declined to be identified or contacted. Logistics companies often store and move valuable art every year, but they rarely check with the ALR, Marinello said. He noted the problem of many owners &quot;reluctant to perform due diligence searching, for fear that they will lose business to competitors who may guarantee a more discreet service&quot;. He added: &quot;Unless \u2026 fine art storage and shipping companies \u2026 agree to police themselves, it may be necessary to push for legislation requiring [more transparency].&quot;", "sentences": ["The collection had disappeared in 2002 en route from his studio to the newly created Karel Appel Foundation in Amsterdam."], "title": "Dutch artist's works found in British warehouse", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/14/dutch-artist-work-found-british-warehouse", "tags": ["Painting", "Art theft", "Art", "Art and design", "Modernism", "Culture", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-15T13:34:26Z", "article": "Boxing and the Olympics have never been easy bedfellows. Back in 1924 Britain\u2019s Harry Mallin, the defending middleweight champion, lost a split decision at the Paris Games to France\u2019s Roger Brousse in the quarter-finals. Mallin complained, showing the referee bite marks on his chest and shoulder (the British press later suggested that Brousse had been \u201csampling the unroasted beef of Old England\u201d), and after an appeal the home fighter was disqualified (it emerged that Brousse\u2019s first-round opponent had also complained of being bitten). Brousse\u2019s fans had to be restrained by the police. Then the Frenchman emerged for the final and it took another intervention from the massed gendarmes to allow Mallin to take his rightful place against John Elliott.   Related: British boxing ridicules plan to let professionals fight at Rio Olympics    Four years later in Amsterdam there were further violent ringside ructions after home-team decisions, at the Rome Games in 1960 judges were sacked after a series of incompetent decisions, in 1968 Choh Dong-kih staged an hour-long sit-down protest in the ring in Tokyo after a disqualification, while Spain\u2019s Valent\u00edn Loren chinned the referee after his DQ. It\u2019s a long and murky history. Or perhaps not that murky given the brazenness of some judging decisions. And the most brazenly bad decision of modern times came in Seoul in 1988 when Roy Jones Jr took on South Korea\u2019s Park Si-hun in the light middleweight gold medal match. The boxing in Seoul had been tumultuous from the off and reached an early nadir in the ugly clinch-strewn bantamweight battle between Bulgaria\u2019s Alexander Hristov and South Korea\u2019s Byun Jong-il. Byun was twice docked points by the referee, New Zealand\u2019s Keith Walker. The deductions cost him the fight and led to Korean officals piling into the ring, aiming kicks and punches at Walker. The referee fled the arena and, almost immediately, the country. While he made his escape, Byun sat in the ring for 67 minutes in protest. The 19-year-old Jones had blazed his way to the final in a flurry of bionic left hooks and twinkling toes. It took him two minutes to dispose of M\u2019tendere Makalamba in his opening match, a brief and brutal affair. Czechoslovakia\u2019s Michal Franek survived a pummelling in the second round, but lost by unanimous 5-0 decision. Jones skipped around the ring pinging punches into Yevgeni Zaytsev\u2019s face in the quarter-finals on his way to another 5-0 win, and was tested by Britain\u2019s Richie Woodhall in the semi-final but largely untroubled and was given another unanimous decision by the judges. Park, meanwhile, had been far less impressive. Some observers felt he could, possibly should, have lost all four of his fights on the way to the final. Certainly Vincenzo Nardiello felt he deserved the nod from the judges in their quarter-final \u2013 when the 3-2 split decision went to the South Korean, the three-times Italian champion went to remonstrate furiously with the officials and had to be dragged away from the ring. The final, on the last day of boxing at the Games, was a rout, Jones, barely bothering to raise his guard, landed 86 punches to Park\u2019s 32. The Korean took two standing eight counts and was twice warned by the referee. NBC\u2019s Count-A-Punch recorder scored the rounds 20-3, 30-15 and 36-14 in Jones\u2019s favour. Watch the footage \u2013 it\u2019s an utterly one-sided affair. The three judges didn\u2019t think so. Bob Kasule of Uganda, Uruguay\u2019s Alberto Dur\u00e1n and Hiouad Larbi of Morocco gave Park the fight, two others giving it to Jones. As the referee, Aldo Leoni, raises Park\u2019s hand, the Korean fighter looks entirely embarrassed. Leoni himself looks disgusted. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re doing this to you,\u201d he whispered to the distraught American. The medal ceremony is equally cringeworthy. Jones received huge cheers, Park, standing on the top of the podium, couldn\u2019t have looked more sheepish had he been bleating and swathed in wool. He held the American\u2019s fist aloft. Jones still looks shell-shocked. \u201cI don\u2019t blame him,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe didn\u2019t score the fight. That\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve ever been dealt in my life. They put the silver medal around my neck, and I took it right off. I won\u2019t put it around my neck ever again.\u201d What happened next? In the aftermath an angry American press pack confronted Larbi. \u201cIt was a terrible thing,\u201d he was quoted as saying by Sports Illustrated. \u201cThe American won easily; so easily, in fact, that I was positive my four fellow judges would score the fight for the American by a wide margin. So I voted for the Korean to make the score only 4-1 for the American and not embarrass the host country.\u201d Larbi, Kasule and Dur\u00e1n were suspended for six months pending an investigation but eventually cleared by the International Boxing Association (AIBA). Several years later, evidence emerged. Karl-Heinz Wuhr, the general secretary of AIBA, was mixing his boxing duties with work as a Stasi agent. When the Stasi\u2019s secret files were released following the collapse of the Soviet Union the investigative journalist and author Andrew Jennings found allegations of outright bribery. \u201cThey did not miss a chance to try to corrupt or influence me,\u201d Wuhr wrote. \u201cThey [the host nation] repeatedly attempted to persuade me to take back my decisions punishing judges they seemed to have an interest in. There were always judges prepared to declare a South Korean boxer victor, even if this was completely ludicrous.\u201d He alleged bribes had been paid to several unnamed judges, including three from Africa and one from South America and felt the \u201cmanipulation\u201d went high up into the executive of AIBA. The referee Leoni supported the claims, saying an Argentinian colleague had been offered an envelope stuffed with cash by the Korean boxing authorities. Jones, though, has never received the gold medal that is rightfully his. In 1997 an IOC investigation concluded that although the offending judges had been wined and dined by Korean organisers, \u201cthere is no evidence of corruption in the boxing events in Seoul\u201d. The chief upshot of one of the worst moments in Olympic history was the introduction of a new electronic scoring system (although that failed to prevent new accusations of bias at the Atlanta Games eight years later). Jones went on to be arguably the best pound-for-pound fighter of the 1990s. \u201cWhen I had that problem in South Korea. I went with an interpreter to face the guy I fought,\u201d he said in 2004. \u201cI asked him \u2018Did you win that fight?\u2019 He shook his head and said \u2018No\u2019. And then I was cool with it. If you tell me the truth, I\u2019m cool.\u201d How the Guardian covered the story:   Related: Professional boxers will be allowed to compete at Rio Olympics    Rumours of bribery and cheating followed the crowning yesterday of the South Korean light-middleweight Park Si-hun as Olympic champion. Park was awarded a 3-2 points decision over Roy Jones of the United States in a fight most observers thought the Korean had clearly lost. Jones was later awarded the Val Barker trophy for the outstanding boxer of the Games. The British judge, Rod Robertson, one of the most respected officials in amateur boxing, who was a spectator, said: \u201cI can only use one word for the decision \u2026 disgraceful.\u201d Even Anwar Chowdhry, the president of the sport\u2019s world governing body, Association International de Boxe Amateur, called the decision \u201cunfair.\u201d Judges from the Soviet Union and Hungary voted Jones the overwhelming winner by four points, those from Uganda, Uruguay and Morocco had the Korean just in front. The latter three judges were also involved when another South Korean, flyweight Kim Kwang-Sun, won his country\u2019s only other boxing final in a 4-1 decision over East Germany\u2019s Andrew Tews.", "sentences": ["Related: British boxing ridicules plan to let professionals fight at Rio Olympics    Four years later in Amsterdam there were further violent ringside ructions after home-team decisions, at the Rome Games in 1960 judges were sacked after a series of incompetent decisions, in 1968 Choh Dong-kih staged an hour-long sit-down protest in the ring in Tokyo after a disqualification, while Spain\u2019s Valent\u00edn Loren chinned the referee after his DQ."], "title": "50 stunning Olympic moments No14: Roy Jones Jr cheated out of gold", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/feb/15/olympic-moments-roy-jones-jr", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: boxing", "Boxing", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-15T18:58:00Z", "article": " Preamble. Morning. The odd thing about England&apos;s outstanding victory in the first ODI is that it was basically scripted by three men: Alastair Cook, Steven Finn and Ravi Bopara. This is a mixed blessing. It means that there is significant scope for improvement but also that we probably shouldn&apos;t read too much into the events of Monday. We will have a better idea after today&apos;s game whether England are putting together a half-decent ODI side, or whether Monday was the 977th false dawn since 1992.  England have won the toss and will again bat first. That&apos;s a very good toss to win, because the ball did a bit under lights the other day. Cook is a magnificent tosser; he has won something like 17 out of 20 as captain. England are unchanged, while Pakistan bring in Azhar Ali, Abdur Rehman and Aizaz Cheema for Asad Shafiq, Shoaib Malik and Wahab Riaz. The introduction of Rehman has to be bad news for England. England Cook (c), Pietersen, Trott, Bopara, Morgan, Kieswetter (wk), Patel, Broad, Swann, Anderson, Finn. Pakistan Hafeez, Farhat, Azhar, Younis, Misbah, U Akmal (wk), Afridi, Rehman, Ajmal, Gul, Cheema.  So how was Valentine&apos;s Day? That bad? Sorry. I won&apos;t bring the subject up again.  1st over: England 0-0 (Cook 0, Pietersen 0) The Sky commentators suggest that the pitch may be a little tired, and Umar Gul&apos;s section ball bounces short of the keeper after beating Cook&apos;s outside edge. The first over is an excellent maiden. That&apos;s it, I&apos;ve had enough. Drop Cook, he&apos;s useless. Look at him, he&apos;s got a strike rate of 0.00. &quot;There really haven&apos;t been that many false dawns,&quot; says Tom Evershed. &quot;You make it sound as though we&apos;ve won 977 ODIs since 1992. We haven&apos;t.&quot; Who needs victories for a false dawn? I hail a new era every time they hit a boundary or bowl a dot ball.  2nd over: England 8-0 (Cook 0, Pietersen 1) It&apos;s not often you&apos;re surprised to see a fast bowler take the new ball, but that&apos;s the case here. We thought either Hafeez or Rehman would bowl the second over, primarily with Pietersen in mind, but in fact it&apos;s the recalled Aizaz Cheema. His first over is a bit of a stinker. The second, third and fourth balls are all wide, with the third swinging down the leg side to the boundary. Cheema&apos;s got the white-ball blues. &quot;Hang on... it was Valentine&apos;s Day yesterday?&quot; deadpans Matt Turland. &quot;No wonder the wife-to-be was a bit peeved at me opting to watch Starship Troopers instead of taking her out for a romantic meal. In my defence, Starship Troopers does have a little bit of romance in it. And Neil Patrick Harris.&quot; I&apos;ve always wondered: do women ever refer to &apos;the boyfriend&apos; or &apos;the husband&apos; or &apos;&apos;im indoors&apos;? I&apos;m almost certain they don&apos;t. I&apos;ve never understand why men do it. After all, these are not the most loving turns of phrase. It&apos;s almost as if men think they&apos;re referring to a piece of property!  3rd over: England 12-0 (Cook 0, Pietersen 5) A cracking stat from Paul Allott on Sky, who tells us that KP is No49 in the ODI world rankings, between Cameron White and Shaun Marsh. He is beaten on the inside by a good delivery from Umar Gul, and then walks across his stumps to flick the next ball fine for four. &quot;False dawns,&quot; says Aatman Chaudhary. &quot;Much like my approach to Indian fast bowlers, every time anyone touches 140 kph I break into a jig of uninhibited glee, Umesh Yadav has been hitting 150 consistently of late, and I&apos;ve been moonwalking to work.&quot; That was the same with England in the early 1990s. You would not believe how exciting it was to see &apos;RF&apos; after the name of an English bowler in Playfair. As natural highs go, it was up there with hearing the Home &amp; Away theme tune.  4th over: England 16-0 (Cook 4, Pietersen 5) Cheema is given a second over, and Cook gets off the mark with a splendid push-drive through extra cover for four. &quot;I think I might have watched too much American wrestling as a student,&quot; says Ant Pease. &quot;How else can I explain that I sometimes reference the literary genius of &apos;Stone Cold&apos; Jane Austen? I can&apos;t shake the idea of her pouring the can of whoop-ass to the right before passing it to the left. Is this normal?&quot; That&apos;s not for me to jud- You eat ready meals for one, don&apos;t you?  5th over: England 19-0 (Cook 6, Pietersen 6) Cook crunches Umar Gul through midwicket for a couple, misses a zesty pull stroke and is beaten by a good one angled across him. This doesn&apos;t look the easiest pitch on which to score runs. &quot;In answer to your question, my wife has just started writing a blog in which she refers to me as the OH,&quot; says Stuart Wilson. &quot;She claims that it stands for other half, but secretly I think that it means obese halfwit. That would be more aligned with her other name for me, Mr Botchit, based on my tendency to do a half-baked job of any task that she ever assigns to me.&quot;  6th over: England 25-0 (Cook 11, Pietersen 7) The offspinner Hafeez replaces Cheema, and Cook times a gorgeous boundary between midwicket and mid-on. That really was an exceptional stroke, and it keeps England ticking off nicely. &quot;A taxi driver once informed me in great and lengthy detail about &apos;the wife&apos;, and might even have mentioned &apos;&apos;er indoors&apos;,&quot; says Stephen Davenport. &quot;Such was the robustness of his Sahf Lahndon accent and his glottal stops, however, that not only was he dropping Hs and Ts, he managed to drop his Fs and a few other consonants as well. It took me a while therefore to understand who he meant by &apos;the wi&apos;&apos;.&quot; In this wireless internet age, there must surely have been an hilarious mix-up in which a fast-talking Geordie complained about &quot;the wife, aye&quot;. Honk! Honk? No, maybe not.  7th over: England 27-0 (Cook 12, Pietersen 8) Pietersen is walking across his stumps and down the track to Umar Gul, to open up the leg side. Two from the over. &quot;Watched a bit of the Second Ashes Test 2005 last night \u2013 one&apos;s true love on Valentine&apos;s after all \u2013 and it reminded me just how far the ball reversed that summer,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Pakistan and England were probably the best at this arcane skill, but even these nations&apos; bowlers seem to have lost the knack. Where has reverse gone?&quot; England got a fair bit in Australia, didn&apos;t they? Although you&apos;re right, it was going round corners in 2005, certainly at Edbgaston and Old Trafford.  8th over: England 36-0 (Cook 20, Pietersen 9) Cook takes consecutive boundaries off Hafeez with two marvellous strokes, a calm lift over midwicket followed by a beautifully timed drive through extra cover. &quot;It&apos;s not the wife aye,&quot; says Martin Lloyd. &quot;It&apos;s worlass.&quot; Ha! Guardian OBO in actual real-life wit shocker. I don&apos;t know how to follow that.  9th over: England 48-0 (Cook 23, Pietersen 17) Pietersen clatters a slower ball from Gul this far over the head of Afridi (I think) in the covers. A princely drive down the ground makes it four boundaries in five balls for England. They&apos;ve scored 21 from the last two overs. &quot;I&apos;m not sure how many of the OBO&apos;s readership regularly scroll through the various topics on &apos;Mumsnet&apos; (you should, it&apos;s fascinating) but the common abbreviation used by the womenfolk for their other halves is DH,&quot; says Paul Claxton. &quot;I&apos;ve been assured by Mrs C that this refers to &apos;darling husband&apos; but I still have my reservations.&quot; It must be that. Dickhead is one word in the Guardian style guide. (Possibly. It probably isn&apos;t in the official Guardian Style Guide, is it now.)  10th over: England 49-0 (Cook 24, Pietersen 18) The excellebnt Abdur Rehman \u2013 who I&apos;ve just realised looks a bit like Dimitar Berbatov \u2013 comes on for Hafeez (2-0-15-0). He was a revelation in the Tests, although his one-day record is mixed: 17 wickets at 46.29 (but with a fine economy rate of 4.25). Just one from the first over. &quot;The husband,&quot; says Sarah Morriss. &quot;I have used this very phrase more than a few times. We&apos;ve split up since mind...&quot;  11th over: England 50-0 (Cook 25, Pietersen 18) Afridi is on for Gul. Cook square drives a single to bring up a good fifty partnership from 62 balls, the only run from a very good over. &quot;A very Guardian riff,&quot; says Hugh Maguire. &quot;While not one I use, at least the phase &apos;the wife&apos; uses the definite article. If you referred to a wife then it would imply a lack of exclusivity that marriage is meant to convey. And actually &apos;My wife&apos; implies more ownership, though is considered more acceptable. A colleague refers to the &apos;Current Mrs Jones&apos; (name changed) though they have been together 40 odd years. Meanwhile \u2013 I&apos;m enjoying the Current England Captain&apos;s knock.&quot; You&apos;re right about my wife and ownership, but it does sound more tender and loving. Hmm. We need a casting judgement from that expert on all things romantic, Mac Millings, masculinity&apos;s answer to Dr Ruth.  12th over: England 58-0 (Cook 26, Pietersen 23) Pietersen takes a couple of jaunty steps down the track and chips Rehman over midwicket for a superb one-bounce four. England are going nicely at the moment. &quot;It&apos;s all about consistency,&quot; says Mac Millings. &quot;It&apos;s fine for me, for example, to refer to &apos;the wife&apos; as long as, when the inevitable happens and she sees sense and hands me the divorce papers, I then start talking about &apos;the barrel of Sorrows Drowner&apos;, &apos;the nights in with just me and the internet bongo&apos; and &apos;the inescapable loneliness&apos;.&quot;  REVIEW! England 58-0 (Pietersen not out 23) Afridi persuades Misbah to review the decision after Pietersen survives a huge LBW shout. This ls very close. Pietersen stretched forward defensively with bat and pad very close together; I suspect the ball hit pad first and then bat a split-second later, but I don&apos;t know if you can be absolutely certain of that. Is there evidence of a clear error? I&apos;m not sure there is. We don&apos;t even know if was hitting the stumps. Pietersen got a huge stride in. Ah, it doesn&apos;t matter, because Hawkeye shows it was only hitting the outside of leg stump. That means the original decision stands, and Pakistan have lost their only review.  13th over: England 58-0 (Cook 26, Pietersen 23) Pietersen survives another big LBW appeal two balls later. He was beaten by a straight, quicker ball, but Pietersen was miles down the track \u2013 over three metres \u2013 and I think that&apos;s why Kumar Dharmasena gave him not out. It was missing leg stump anyway. Excellent umpiring from Dharmasena, and a superb maiden from Afridi. &quot;The one that makes me vomit is &apos;hubby&apos;,&quot; says Kathryn Oliver. &quot;As in, &apos;Ooh, can&apos;t wait to see you girls! Are we bringing our hubbies??!!&apos; No we are not.&quot;  14th over: England 61-0 (Cook 28, Pietersen 24) Three singles from Rehman&apos;s over. England&apos;s scoring rate has dropped a bit, with 13 from the last five overs, but that&apos;s understandable as they get used to facing this excellent slow bowling. &quot;DH on Mumsnet is actually me,&quot; says Daniel Harris. &quot;I&apos;m a sensual, carefree, Berbatovian lover.&quot; Rehmanian you mean.  15th over: England 65-0 (Cook 31, Pietersen 25) Cook is dropped by Umar Akmal. He top-edged an attempted cut at Afridi, but Umar Akmal was slow to react and the ball bounced out of his gloves. It&apos;s hard to be too critical of Akmal, especially because, as Waqar Younis says on Sky, he is a part-time keeper. &quot;A friend of mine refers to his lady partner as his &apos;Doris&apos;,&quot; says Tom James. &quot;I&apos;ve never quite understood it. My grandmother was called Doris, maybe this feeds my discomfort around the term.&quot;  WICKET! England 67-1 (Pietersen LBW b Ajmal 26) Saeed Ajmal strikes with his third ball. That was far too easy. Pietersen dragged his bat around his front pad at a delivery that straightened sharply from around the wicket to hit the pad in front of middle stump. He was so plumb that he barely considered a review.  16th over: England 69-1 (Cook 32, Trott 2) Shabash shabash Ajmal. That was, as Nasser points out on Sky, almost identical to KP&apos;s dismissal in the second innings of the third Test, except he was bowled that time and LBW here. &quot;How, for that matter, does one refer to someone to whom one is not married but with whom one is engaged in a, for want of a better word, ROMANTIC relationship?&quot; says Jessie Greengrass. &quot;&apos;Boyfriend&apos; makes you sound 12 and coy. &apos;Partner&apos; is po-faced. &apos;Other half&apos; makes me want to stick things in my eyes. I generally refer to my um, er as my er, well, um.&quot; You can&apos;t go wrong with &apos;squeeze&apos;. (Disclaimer: you can go wrong. And will, bloody quickly\u00a0\u2013 quicker than you can say &apos;do you have any ready meals for one&apos; in fact \u2013 if you introduce your hot new boy/girlfriend by saying &apos;This my squeeze&apos;.)  17th over: England 75-1 (Cook 37, Trott 3) Cook cuts Afridi for four, another cracking stroke. He is so important here, as England&apos;s middle order looks pretty fragile due to the number of players out of form or out of position. &quot;My wife calls me Selve, and I call her Selve,&quot; says, er, Selve. &quot;Easy to remember (and unless she is pissed off with me in which case she sounds like my mum). Confusing if I&apos;m giving myself a talking to though.&quot; The Meg Ryan moments must be interesting as well.  18th over: England 80-1 (Cook 37, Trott 8) A rare bad ball from Ajmal, who is still bowling around the wicket to the right-hander, is wafted through extra cover for four by Trott. The relatively high number of boundaries for England in these conditions \u2013 10 in 18 overs, new dawn ahoy \u2013 means that they won&apos;t be too worried by the dot-ball percentage in the last few overs. &quot;I remember being very disconcerted as a youngster when my best friend would call his dad by his first name,&quot; says Peter Collins. &quot;I&apos;m 49 now, and can&apos;t conceive of calling my dad anything but, well, &apos;dad&apos;. Does anyone else call their parents by their first names?&quot; I assumed that only occurred in quasi-hippy films starring Patricia Clarkson.  19th over: England 85-1 (Cook 39, Trott 11) Trott fails to pick Afridi&apos;s googly and inside edges it past leg stump for one of five singles in the over. &quot;Does Rehman actually look like Berba,&quot; says William Hardy, &quot;or has his lack of action this season lead to withdrawal symptoms and hallucinations?&quot; Yes he does remember Berbatov. So do Fearne Cotton, Ferris Bueller, Keyser Soze, Damien Hirst&apos;s shark and the potato waffle in my freezer.  20th over: England 88-1 (Cook 40, Trott 13) Three singles from Ajmal&apos;s third over. The game has settled down a little bit, although the middle overs are never truly boring when Pakistan are bowling. &quot;I call my wife &apos;Selve&apos; too,&quot; says Alex Netherton. Please, no jokes about the corridor of uncertainty, or the shiny side.  21st over: England 92-1 (Cook 42, Trott 15) Trott is beaten by a fine legspinner from Afridi. That ripped a fair way, and Trott was a little tentative because he can&apos;t pick Afridi. Four singles from the over. &quot;I had a girlfriend who decided she didn&apos;t like the terms &quot;girlfriend&quot; or &quot;partner&quot;,&quot; says Patrick Harvey, &quot;so I began introducing her as &quot;my ladyfriend&quot;, with predictable consequences.&quot; You woke up in an episode of Downton Abbey?  22nd over: England 96-1 (Cook 44, Trott 17) Misbah is taking a bit of flak from Nasser and Waqar for his defensive fields, with singles available for England all round the ground. Four more in that over, which makes it (I think) 16 singles in the last four overs. &quot;I like to refer to my better half, when introducing her to people, thus: &quot;this is [name], who through no fault of her own has the very great misfortune to be engaged to me&quot;,&quot; says Andrew Benzeval. &quot;I find it&apos;s best to deal with it up front, before someone else points it out. I can&apos;t call her my &quot;fianc\u00e9&quot; anyway, as I&apos;m not a character in a Thomas Hardy novel.&quot; And because she&apos;s female, presumably.  23rd over: England 103-1 (Cook 49, Trott 19) A pitiful long hop from Afridi is mauled over midwicket for four by Cook. This is excellent stuff from England. Even allowing for the inevitable mid-innings collapse, they are well set for a total in excess of 250. &quot;Surely the safe approach is just to introduce or refer to your partner by their actual name,&quot; says Pete Inness. &quot; This throws the onus of how to decribe them onto the person you&apos;re talking to \u2013 they can then either ask you straight out what the status of your relationship is, or just skip over the subject and move on, saving embarrassment on both sides.&quot;  24th over: England 105-1 (Cook 49, Trott 21) An excellent quicker ball from Rehman brings a biggish shout for LBW against Trott, but it was going well down the leg side. Pakistan desperately need a wicket, because England are stockpiling runs almost at their leisure. &quot;My friend Matthew Moore refers to &apos;the future ex Mrs Moore&apos;, the old romantic,&quot; says Matt Costelloe.  25th over: England 108-1 (Cook 51, Trott 22) Cook cuts the new bowler Cheema for a single to bring up another excellent fifty, this one from 66 balls. It&apos;s the first of three singles from a low-key over, and here&apos;s Leo Mirani. &quot;I suppose &apos;my chickie&apos; is out of the question?&quot; I&apos;d say so, especially if you plan on having children in the future.  26th over: England 115-1 (Cook 57, Trott 23) Cook sweeps firmly behind square for two and then opens the face to steer past short third man for three. That&apos;s the sort of shot he almost certainly could not have played a year ago. The way he has expanded his game is mightily impressive. &quot;I have been known to introduce my one and only as &apos;my first wife&apos;,&quot; says Paul Taylor. &quot;Really gets the conversation going, after a bit of awkward silence.&quot; Ha. That&apos;s the kind of thing Royal Tenenbaum would do.  WICKET! England 116-2 (Trott c U Akmal b Cheema 23) A tame end for Jonathan Trott, who throws the bat at a wide, shortish delivery from Cheema and snicks it through to Umar Akmal.  27th over: England 116-2 (Cook 58, Bopara 0) Bopara is beaten on the inside by his first delivery. That was a really good over from Cheema. &quot;Wife names. The Warden. End of tedious thread,&quot; says John Dutton, whose gang I want to be in.  28th over: England 120-2 (Cook 60, Bopara 2) A leading edge from Cook, off the bowling of Rehman, plops not far short of extra cover. Then Bopara takes a suicidal single to mid-on, and only survives because Farhat&apos;s throw misses the stumps. &quot;My brother worrying refers to me, his girlfriend and our mum by the same nickname: &apos;Bubs&apos;,&quot; says Jonathan Hollis. &quot;Permission to vomit.&quot; It does put the &apos;retch&apos; in &apos;wretched&apos;, that.  29th over: England 128-2 (Cook 62, Bopara 8) Here&apos;s this week&apos;s edition of The Spin by young Bull. Back in Abu Dhabi, Bopara snicks Cheema just wide of the diving Younis at slip, and the ball rushes away for four. Eight runs from the over, which is harsh because it was an excellent one from Cheema. &quot;The indispensable reference work that is Viz&apos;s Profanasaurus proposes that a female half of a married couple be referred to as a &apos;bag for life&apos;,&quot; says David Hopkins. &quot;I found this quite amusing, and am unmarried. I suspect these two things are not unrelated.&quot;  30th over: England 129-2 (Cook 62, Bopara 8) A fine over from Rehman includes five straight dot balls to Bopara. England are fine for now but they will have to slip a gear in the next few overs. &quot;You can&apos;t beat the late, great Peter Cook on this subject,&quot; says Martin Sedgwick. &quot;He generally opted for &apos;My good lady wife whose name, for the moment, escapes me.&apos;  31st over: England 136-2 (Cook 68, Bopara 9) Cook rifles Cheema on the up through extra cover for four, the first authentic boundary for eight overs. Is this the bit where I tempt fate by wondering when an England batsman/opener/captain last scored back-to-back ODI hundreds? &quot;I refer to you-know-who as &apos;my attainable alternative to Paul Collingwood&apos;,&quot; says Kat Petersen. &quot;Rarely to his face, mind.&quot;  32nd over: England 140-2 (Cook 70, Bopara 11) Cook survives a fairly big LBW shout from Rehman, but the ball was turning down the leg side. &quot;Is it common practice for teams to stay in the same hotel whilst on tour?&quot; says James Burckhardt. &quot;Spotted England and Pakistan both having breakfast in my hotel today... English lads were very light eaters from what. I say \u2013 more fruit and muesli rather than grease and fry-up!&quot; I think it&apos;s fairly common, although I don&apos;t really have a clue what I&apos;m talking about as I&apos;m usually in the office. Selve? Anyonoe?  33rd over: England 143-2 (Cook 71, Bopara 12) Hafeez comes on for Cheema, who bowled a very good four-over spell. Three from the over. &quot;Re: &apos;squeeze&apos;,&quot; begins Jessie Greengrass. &quot;My grandmother once advocated the use of the term &apos;main squeeze&apos;, presumably designed to suggest that you are with the preferred of one&apos;s obviously many actual squeezes. Try using that one and still having anything but a pillow to squeeze by the end of the night.&quot;  34th over: England 148-2 (Cook 75, Bopara 13) Cook chops Rehman through backward point for a couple in an over that brings five. Rehman ends with figures of 10-1-36-0, a microcosm of his one-day career. &quot;I have for some years referred to boyfriends (current, previous and those belonging to other people) as &apos;the manwife&apos;,&quot; says Chantal Tucker. &quot;No one has complained so far...to me anyway.&quot;  35th over: England 154-2 (Cook 79, Bopara 15) &quot;As a Cornishman in London, I like to pay tribute to my heritage by referring to everyone as &apos;my lover&apos; with a thick accent, regardless of whether or not they are, in fact, my lover,&quot; says Mark Jelbert. &quot;The reactions range from mild surprise to looks of genuine pity.&quot;  36th over: England 159-2 (Cook 82, Bopara 17) England must take their batting Powerplay at this point (you have to use it before the 40th over). Pakistan turn to Saeed Ajmal, as you&apos;d expect, and he beats Cook with the last delivery of a good over. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of carping at ready-meal for one consumers,&quot; says Ian Copestake, &quot;but really the high point is when you have them delivered.&quot;  37th over: England 168-2 (Cook 83, Bopara 25) Bopara pings Umar Gul through midwicket for three, a shot of excellent placement, and then slams a wide short ball through the covers for four. That brings up the fifty partnership.  38th over: England 175-2 (Cook 88, Bopara 27) &quot;The Only Way Is Essex in the middle,&quot; says Nasser Hussain on Sky. Cook edges Ajmal through the vacant slip area for four, and three additional singles make it a good over for England. They should certainly get 250 here, and if Morgan comes off \u2013 a big if just now, admittedly \u2013 they might be nearer 300. &quot;Since moving to UAE 5 months ago I have found many wonderful and many awful things about the country,&quot; says Michael Hunt. &quot;The uppermost of each is that Burger King and KFC deliver to your door.&quot;  39th over: England 188-2 (Cook 99, Bopara 29) Cook moves into the nineties with a belting stroke, picking up Umar Gul over midwicket for four, and a square-driven boundary off the last ball takes him to 99. This is top work from England, who have scored 29 from four Powerplay overs. &quot;Can I point any OBOers feeling a bit flush in the direction of my mate who, despite never having cycled more than 30km in a go, is attempting to cycle from John O&apos;Groats to Lands End in ten days,&quot; says Piers Barclay. &quot;That&apos;s an average of 150km a day. He&apos;ll need all the help he can get, and it&apos;s for a very good cause.&quot;  40th over: England 192-2 (Cook 101, Bopara 31) Alastair Cook steers Ajmal for a single and becomes the first England captain to score consecutive ODI hundreds. What an awesome performance this has been. It surely kills any lingering doubts about whether he will make it in this form of the game. Cook celebrates calmly; he has always put the team first and he knows the job isn&apos;t done yet. &quot;It is common practice in South Yorkshire for men to refer to their wife, or girlfriend, as &apos;our lass&apos; and their mother as &apos;our old lass&apos;,&quot; says Paula Finn. &quot;Just thought I&apos;d throw that into the mix!&quot; Shared ownership eh? I&apos;m saying nothing.  WICKET! England 194-3 (Cook ct and b Afridi 102) Cook pops a simple return catch to Shahid Afridi and boots the turf in disgust. That&apos;s a nice snapshot of a man who could barely give a solitary one about individual achievements. He is really cross with himself. In time he will reflect on these few days as some of the proudest of his career. He has played two outstanding innings, clear-headed and strong-willed, to lift England from their knees.  41st over: England 194-3 (Bopara 32, Morgan 0) Morgan is dropped first ball, bottom-edging a cut that bounces off Umar Akmal&apos;s fingertips. It was a very difficult chance, especially for a part-time keeper. &quot;Personally I like the term &apos;fancy piece&apos;,&quot; says Michael Plevin. &quot;My dad once used it to describe a lady that one of my friends was stepping out with (I like that turn of phrase too). It sounds nice but I think it means prostitute. Most modern day ladies are (hopefully) unaware of this definition.&quot; Fancy piece?! That sounds like something you&apos;d buy in Habitat.  42nd over: England 199-3 (Bopara 37, Morgan 0) Bopara slices Ajmal through the vacant slip area for four, and then a single brings Morgan on strike. This is a mighty test of his outstanding temperament, and he can&apos;t get off the mark from the last two deliveries. &quot;Ever keen to flaunt my knowledge of French, I always referred to girlfriends as &apos;my heart&apos;, &apos;my doe&apos; or &apos;my cabbage&apos;, some of the more common terms of endearment across the Channel,&quot; says David Guerry. &quot;Having thus enlightened you I&apos;ll now tuck into my postprandial scotch egg.  43rd over: England 203-3 (Bopara 39, Morgan 2) Morgan is all over the place. He is beaten by an Afridi googly, and misses an attempted reverse-sweep next ball. He does get off the mark from his seventh delivery with a cut to short third man. &quot;Valentine&apos;s day evening (or should that be Valentine&apos;s evening) was spent in a bar in Reykjavik listening to an Icelandic Fleetwood Mac tribute band,&quot; says Caro Cowan. &quot;I&apos;m sure there&apos;s some metaphor for my disastrous love life in there somewhere. Especially given my name (they, unfortunately, didn&apos;t play that song).&quot;  44th over: England 209-3 (Bopara 41, Morgan 4) In times of trouble, Adam Gilchrist would remind himself of four simple words. Just. Hit. The. Ball. Morgan seems to be thinking too much, which is entirely understandable but probably not helpful. Six from Ajmal&apos;s over, including consecutive wides. &quot;On the subject of Yorkshire,&quot; says Alex Marsh, &quot;my housemate at Uni called his older brother &apos;our kid&apos;. That said, he also called his dad &apos;Big Nardz&apos; and his mum by her first name (Beryl), so I&apos;m not sure whether you can take this as normal behaviour.&quot;  45th over: England 215-3 (Bopara 44, Morgan 6) No boundaries in Afridi&apos;s last over, although England will be happy enough to take six runs from it. Afridi ends with figures of 10-1-38-1. &quot;Ten more years of this and Cook will be the first to reach the (not very artificial at all) milestone of 100 international hundreds,&quot; says Simon Thomas. &quot;And who is to say he doesn&apos;t deserve it?&quot; Meanwhile the 48-year-old Sachin Tendulkar will have just been dismissed for his 13th consecutive Test duck at home to Ireland.  46th over: England 221-3 (Bopara 45, Morgan 11) Cheema returns to the attack, so presumably Ajmal (8-0-39-1) will change ends. Morgan seems a bit happier with pace on the ball and steals consecutive twos to deep point and long on. Cheema finishes the over despite a calf problem, so we might not see him again today. &quot;The magnificent Jonathan Richman wrote a fine song about the female semantic conundrum,&quot; says Chris Stephens. &quot;For some reason the only version on the internet is seemingly recorded off an abysmal American internet station but you get the gist.&quot;  47th over: England 228-3 (Bopara 48, Morgan 15) Still no sign of a boundary \u2013 the last was in the 42nd over \u2013 but Morgan chips Ajmal over wide mid off for two in an over that yields seven. &quot;Ravi&apos;s in an interesting position isn&apos;t he?&quot; says Sir Garry Naylor. &quot;If England secure the victory, I suspect we&apos;ll get a spate of &apos;New Responsible Ravi secures No4 slot as England&apos;s ODI side take shape&apos;. If Pakistan get over line this evening, we&apos;ll have &apos;Ravi fails to capitalise on starts as England&apos;s middle order stutters&apos;. History \u2013 written by the winners I understand.&quot;  48th over: England 232-3 (Bopara 50, Morgan 17) Bopara hooks Cheema for a single to reach consecutive ODI fifties for the first time in his career. (He did score three consecutive Test centuries, mind.) That was an excellent over from Cheema, costing just five. England have lost their way a touch, with only 44 from the last nine overs. &quot;Why not use the old English system of referring to your wife (or as-good-as) by her surname?&quot; says Suky Lo. &quot;Unless her name is Haugh of course.&quot; Haw haw.  49th over: England 242-3 (Bopara 51, Morgan 24) That&apos;s the Eoin Morgan we know and love with a fervour that might be slightly inappropriate for a heterosexual male. He has just slog-swept Ajmal for a mighty six over midwicket, the first of the series on either side I think. Ten from the over, so AJmal ends with figures of 10-0-54-1. England will be happy with those. &quot;In this day and age using the term &apos;partner&apos; can leave people wondering if you&apos;re gay (which can be quite useful),&quot; says Joanne Beasley. &quot;However I sometimes use the phrase &apos;My mate&apos;. People usually assume it&apos;s platonic which keeps the door open if you&apos;re talking to someone you quite fancy the look of. I know, I&apos;m a romantic softy.&quot; Maybe you could introduce them by saying, &apos;here&apos;s XXX, he&apos;s my somebody I quite fancy the look of&apos;. Up the romantic ante.  WICKET! 50 overs: England 250-4 (Bopara c U Akmal b Cheema 58; Morgan not out 25) Bopara falls to the last ball of the innings, slicing Cheema miles in the air. The last over cost eight, which was a good effort from the impressive Cheema. An ODI scorecard always looks a little odd if you lose only four wickets yet don&apos;t score more than 250. Still, on balance England will be pleased with that. Pakistan need 251 to win. See you in half an hour for their reply.  INNINGS BREAK  1st over: Pakistan 2-0 (target 251; Hafeez 0, Farhat 1) Hello again. No time for preambulation; here comes Steven Finn. His fourth ball is slapped towards the covers, where the substitute Bairstow saves four with an excellent stop. He&apos;s on for Bopara. That was a good first over from Finn, with an encouraging hint of sideways movement. &quot;What was on the menu in the Guardian canteen, Rob?&quot; says Anus McGuigan. It shuts between 2.30 and 4.30, Anus. And they don&apos;t serve foie gras anyway.  2nd over: Pakistan 5-0 (target 251; Hafeez 0, Farhat 3) Jimmy Anderson starts with a wide and then beats Farhat twice, first with a lifter and then an outswinger. &quot;I like Americans who refer to their wives as &apos;my bride&apos;,&quot; says Charles Hart. &quot;It sounds romantic even after 30-40 years of marriage.&quot; It&apos;s a lovely thing when you see an octogenarian who still looks at his bride as if she&apos;s a pretty young thing in her early twenties. Except when it&apos;s Hugh Hefner, and she actually is in her early twenties.  3rd over: Pakistan 8-0 (target 251; Hafeez 3, Farhat 3) Finn looks mean and purposeful, stomping back to his mark before each delivery. Hafeez forces him through the covers for two to get off the mark, and then Farhat fresh-airs an expansive drive at an excellent outswinger. Good stuff from England. &quot;Unless I had one too many pints of lunch, I swear that TMS are talking about the bowlers using a different new ball from each end, yet you&apos;ve not mentioned it. (unless I missed that too),&quot; says Phil Powell. &quot;What gives?&quot; Yeah, they&apos;ve been doing that for a few months now \u2013 it was one of the changes they made last year.  4th over: Pakistan 9-0 (target 251; Hafeez 4, Farhat 3) Anderson strays onto the pads a couple of times but Farhat can&apos;t put him away. One from the over. You sense a big shot might be coming, certainly from Farhat. &quot;The reference to the late great Peter Cook prompts me to ask about a film I saw ages ago about a bloke desperate for money in the short term and (I think) chasing all over London in pursuit thereof, stopping several times along the way to donate blood thus growing weaker and weaker as time wore on,&quot; says Paul Taylor. &quot;Sounds like a Cook/Moore opus, but I have not been able to identify/locate same. Any ideas?&quot;  5th over: Pakistan 9-0 (target 251; Hafeez 4, Farhat 3) A high-class maiden from Finn, who gave Hafeez absolutely nothing to work with. His figures are 3-1-4-0. &quot;We call each other Mr and Mrs Starbuck, except at family events which would make it too confusing,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;It all depends on the mood of the time, so now and again we do it in Italian or French; when I get called Sweetie Darling I know she wants something.&quot;  6th over: Pakistan 17-0 (target 251; Hafeez 4, Farhat 11) Farhat pings Anderson wristily through midwicket for the first boundary of the innings. A couple of twos make it Pakistan&apos;s most productive over by a distance.  7th over: Pakistan 18-0 (target 251; Hafeez 5, Farhat 11) Finn is all over Hafeez here. Every ball is on the money, ramming into the bat, and all Hafeez can do is squirt a single off the final ball of another very good over. &quot;Following on from the earlier discussion about terms for partners/boyfriends etc, I am wondering if anyone, apart from me, gives names to their sat nav devices,&quot; says Phil Keegan. &quot;I have had two of these things so far, one in Austria where I previously lived and one now in Malaysia, where I currently live. I have named them both Doris, though I have no idea why as I have absolutely no association or connection with the name at all. With my Austrian Doris, I used to alternate between the American Doris voice, who was no-nonsense and faintly aggressive, and the English Doris, who sounded constipated and and a bit annoyed (as I often am). German Doris was downright rude. With my Malaysian Doris, the only not totally annoying voice is Australian Doris, who cannot even come close to pronouncing Malaysian street names with any degree of accuracy, but then neither can I.&quot; I don&apos;t know what to say.  8th over: Pakistan 26-0 (target 251; Hafeez 13, Farhat 11) Stuart Broad replaces Anderson, and starts with a hideous loosener that is rifled through extra cover for four by Hafeez. His fifth ball drifts onto the pads and is chipped calmly over midwicket for four more. Well played. &quot;Sorry for the absence Rob,&quot; says Selve. &quot;I&apos;ve been out to lunch at Carluccio with Selve. And then buying sun dried tomato focaccia, large green olives and sweet garlic from an Italian market. Now I come back to find that Alastair Cook has suddenly become one of the foremost ODI opening batsmen in the game today. Steve Finn, of course, I&apos;ve been telling you about for ages. Should have played in the first Test, and was within minutes of playing in the second.&quot;  9th over: Pakistan 29-0 (target 251; Hafeez 13, Farhat 11) The fact England haven&apos;t taken any early wickets makes this a good test. Everything came fairly naturally on Monday after that early burst from Finn. They will have to work much harder to win this. Another excellent over from Finn is tarnished only by a wide. He has conceded only six runs from five overs. &quot;I call my wife &apos;she who must be obeyed at all times without question&apos;,&quot; chirps Ross Bennett. &quot;Also &apos;the Boss&apos;, &apos;head honcho&apos;, &apos;la grande fromage&apos; , &apos;the duchess&apos;, &apos;Queen Bee&apos;, &apos;thr trouble and strife&apos; &apos;my significant other&apos; &apos;life partner&apos; &apos;woman of my dreams&apos; etc etc now can we PLEASE drop this thread?????&quot; Since you asked so nicely, why not? Anyone got a new thread.  11th over: Pakistan 39-0 (target 251; Hafeez 19, Farhat 17) This is an interesting move. With the first Powerplay done, Graeme Swann comes on for Steven Finn. His first ball is a jaffa that curves in and spits past Imran Farhat&apos;s outside edge. Kieswetter had the bails off in a hurry, but Farhat&apos;s back foot was just in the crease and he survived a referral to the third umpire. Swann&apos;s third ball also turns very nastily, back into Hafeez this time. Farhat drives the last ball confidently over mid off for four, but that was still a very encouraging over for England. &quot;Can the next riff be nicknames for Ross Bennett?&quot; says Ant Pease.  12th over: Pakistan 44-0 (target 251; Hafeez 22, Farhat 19) Five singles from Broad&apos;s over. &quot;This is why I love the OBO regulars,&quot; says Dan Lucas, misspelling &apos;tolerate&apos;. &quot;A bunch of clever creative types writing names for the spouses they imagine themselves enjoying a relationship of Cook-Trott-esque longevity with, but whom we all all know to be about as real as Shane Warne&apos;s 874th variation on the flipper.&quot;  13th over: Pakistan 50-0 (target 251; Hafeez 23, Farhat 24) Farhat opens the face to Swann past short third man for four, and a single to leg brings up an excellent fifty partnership. England need a wicket before bad things start happening. &quot;I&apos;m flying to Vancouver, BC, today,&quot; says Sara Torvalds. &quot;Any suggestions as to what I shouldn&apos;t miss?&quot; Somebody is going to reply &apos;your flight&apos;, aren&apos;t they?  14th over: Pakistan 55-0 (target 251; Hafeez 25, Farhat 27) Ravi Bopara comes on for some wicket-to-wicket hustle. Five low-risk singles from the over; Pakistan are cruising just now. &quot;A few people at work are planning a &apos;minestrone off&apos; \u2013 are any of your readers able to recommend a recipe that will ensure my victory?&quot; says Ian Middleton. &quot;I don&apos;t really care if it&apos;s vegetarian or not.&quot; How strick is the definition of &apos;minestrone&apos;? Just give them a Hawksmoor ribeye; they will be too overwhelmed with joy to complain about the fact it&apos;s not minestrone, or soup.  15th over: Pakistan 61-0 (target 251; Hafeez 26, Farhat 29) Hafeez survives a biggish shout for LBW when he misses a scoop at Swann. There was plenty of doubt over height and whether it hit him outside the line. Replays show it was a good decision from Aleem Dar. Farhat toe-ends the next ball not far short of cover. Plenty is happening for Swann, but England could really do with a wicket. &quot;For Sara Torvalds (over 13),&quot; says Janet Stevens &quot;Any gig with Hoto on drums. (His proud good-as-godmother.)  WICKET! Pakistan 61-1 (Hafeez c Trott b Anderson 26) Some good captaincy from Alastair Cook brings the wicket England need. He decided to take the bowling Powerplay straight away, a risky move at a time when Pakistan were cruising, and was rewarded with a wicket two balls later. Hafeez tamely chipped an inswinger from Anderson straight to midwicket, where Trott took a comfortable catch.  16th over: Pakistan 69-1 (target 251; Farhat 32, Azhar 5) Farhat drives Anderson on the up and wide extra cover for three, and then Azhar Ali tickles some rubbish off the pads for four. &quot;Sara Torvalds has to make sure she visits Vancouver Island,&quot; says William Hardy. &quot;And do some skiing \u2013 Jasper, Whistler and Banff would be my suggestions. And go watch some hockey. It&apos;s annoying but mental.&quot;  17th over: Pakistan 70-1 (target 251; Farhat 33, Azhar 5) Samit Patel replaces Swann and rushes through his first over at a cost of a single. &quot;I&apos;d previously scoffed at your high praise for the Hawksmoor ribeye,&quot; says Jim Carpenter. &quot;Recently got taken there on the company dime to discover that all the previous meat I&apos;d ever eaten was just some form of imitation. And did you try the brussel sprouts? Best thing I&apos;ve ever put in my mouth.&quot; I didn&apos;t because I&apos;m slightly weird so I just had the meat, although my friends were also raving about the bone marrow gravy. The ribeye is unquestionably the best thing that has ever happened to anyone, ever.  18th over: Pakistan 76-1 (target 251; Farhat 37, Azhar 6) Azhar Ali is beaten by a grubbing cutter from Anderson that also goes through Kieswetter for a bye. That brings Farhat on strike, and he slugs the next ball over mid-on for a one-bounce four. That&apos;s an excellent stroke. He looks dangerous. &quot;I would recommend a trip to Grouse Mountain, particularly very early in the morning when you&apos;ve got it pretty much to yourself \u2013 one of the times when jetlag is your friend,&quot; says Tom Hopkins. &quot;I&apos;m less sure about the Grouse Grind (i.e. walking up the thing), I remember thinking I was starting to struggle and I must be nearly there shortly before reaching a sign saying &apos;You are 1/4 of the way to the top&apos;. By the end I was overtaken by several senior citizens. If there had been a squeeze/ladyfriend/Selve with me, she may have started to ask some questions.&quot;  19th over: Pakistan 80-1 (target 251; Farhat 39, Azhar 6) Farhat times Patel through extra cover for a couple. His one-day career has been a disappointment apart from the purplest of patches in December 2003, but he looks calm and in control today. Pakistan need 171 from 182 balls and are probably slight favourites. &quot;May I suggest that your correspondent who is flying to Vancouver miss Vancouver?&quot; says Nick Lezard. &quot;It is most dull. The surrounding countryside is lovely, when you can see it behind the curtains of rain, but a city that defines itself by how lovely its surrounding countryside is can be said to have fallen at the first hurdle when it comes to being a city.&quot;  20th over: Pakistan 87-1 (target 251; Farhat 45, Azhar 6) Farhat is dropped by Kieswetter! Broad, on for Anderson, rammed in a beautifully directed short ball; Farhat shaped to glide it over the top but ended up gloving it to the left of Kieswetter. He leapt to his left and tried to catch with his right hand, but could only help it towards the boundary. Broad has the face on, and Kieswetter should probably have taken it. He actually dived too far, and the ball hit him on the wrist rather than in the glove. He did that last year I think, although I can&apos;t remember which game it was. &quot;On the minestrone front, I&apos;m making a Tuscan Three Bean Soup tonight if that is any help?&quot; says Mike Selvey. &quot;Onion softened, garlic sliced, chopped celery, and carrot added and smoked bacon also chopped (pancetta ideally though), tin chopped tomatoes, oregano, rosemary, home made chicken stock, good squirt Heinz TK, 1 tin each borlotti, cannellini, and kidney beans, and some of that tiny star shaped pasta, seasoning. Job done.&quot; Selve is a lucky lady, Selve.  21st over: Pakistan 91-1 (target 251; Farhat 47, Azhar 8) Four from Patel&apos;s over. Pakistan&apos;s required rate is still below 5.5 per over, although they are fractionally behind on the comparison. England were 92 for one at this stage. &quot;Now, just waaaaaaiiiiit a minute \u2013 if you&apos;re talking steaks then I must recommend Goodmans Steak Restaurant in Bank,&quot; says Daniel Beckell. &quot;It was the only thing which took the edge off attending a Will Young gig at Shepherds Bush empire with the wife...&quot; I&apos;m sure it&apos;s wonderful, but have you tried the Hawksmoor? You&apos;ll never look at a Lidl steak the same again.  WICKET! Pakistan 92-2 (Farhat run out 47) What a preposterous brainfade from Imran Farhat. He was hit on the boot by a loopy slower ball from Broad, who went up for LBW. Farhat instinctively took a few steps down the track while the umpire considered the LBW appeal (which was a decent one), and then dithered inexplicably as Broad followed through to hit the stumps with an underarm throw. Aleem Dar didn&apos;t even need to check with the third umpire. It was great work from Broad, but I have no idea what Farhat was doing. He didn&apos;t know where the ball had gone, and by the time he realised it was too late.  22nd over: Pakistan 96-2 (target 251; Azhar 10, Younis 2) Pakistan&apos;s target is now 155 from 168 balls.  23rd over: Pakistan 101-2 (target 251; Azhar 13, Younis 3) Patel and Kieswetter go up for LBW when Younis appears to miss a sweep. Aleem Dar does not so much reject the appeal as ignore it, and replays show that it was glove first and then pad. Patel is feeling the back of his leg; hopefully it&apos;s just cramp rather than anything more. Azhar Ali brings up the hundred with a brilliantly placed slap through extra cover for four. &quot;William Hardy&apos;s suggestion of skiing Banff and Jasper are all well and good except for the part that Banff and Jasper are in the next province to Vancouver, BC,&quot; says Bryan Regehr. &quot;And considering that BC itself is larger than the British Isles combined, it may be a bit of a trek from Vancouver to visit those lovely areas in Alberta. Whistler&apos;s good though.&quot;  24th over: Pakistan 101-2 (target 251; Azhar 13, Younis 3) Swann comes back to replace Broad, who has gone off the field. No idea why. A lot goes on in Swann&apos;s fourth over, but nothing happens. Three from it. &quot;I do love the enthusiasm with which you write WICKET!&quot; says Richard Parker. &quot;It perfectly conveys the visions I have of you guys in your sandals and tank-tops jumping up in the air, arms aloft shouting WICKET!!! at the top of your voice\u2026 You probably dress in an ultra cool London fashion but that&apos;s what you all dress like in my mind.&quot; We sure do dress in an ultra cool London fashion. This was the last OBO team photo.  WICKET! Pakistan 104-3 (Younis LBW b Patel 5) Samit Patel has got the big wicket of Younis Khan. Younis missed a sweep at a ball from over the wicket that straightened enough to suggest it might hit leg stump. Aleem Dar certainly thought so. He raised the finger and, although Younis discussed a review with Azhar Ali, he eventually decided to take his medicine. I&apos;m surprised he didn&apos;t review it because that was pretty tight.  25th over: Pakistan 108-3 (target 251; Azhar 16, Misbah 2) The new batsman is the LBW ambassador Misbah-ul-Haq. Younis was right not to review the decision, as replays showed it was hitting the outside of leg stump. &quot;I have eaten steak in Michelin starred restaurants in Paris,&quot; says Alex Gask. &quot;I have eaten steak in the US of A. I have eaten steak in fine restaurants in Asia &amp; South America. Without doubt the finest, most flavoursome steak I have eaten in my 34 years on this earth was at Hawksmoor on Commercial Street, E1. In fact I have just now resolved to take my wife (&quot;Honey&quot; since you didn&apos;t ask) for a belated Valentine&apos;s meal there tomorrow night.&quot;  26th over: Pakistan 109-3 (target 251; Azhar 17, Misbah 2) Azhar laps Swann just short of square leg. Only one from the over. This is a good spell for England. &quot;You can keep your Hawksmoor rib-eye (and yes, I&apos;ve had it),&quot; says Martin Whitaker. &quot;This is the true king of steaks, a 2 kg Fiorentina from the backwaters of Emilia-Romagna. Great website too - who knew Albert Einstein was a mushroom picker?&quot;  27th over: Pakistan 113-3 (target 251; Azhar 20, Misbah 3) Patel almost skids the quicker one through Misbah. Just as you start to think, I HEART SAMIT, he gives away a run next ball with a dreadful misfield. It&apos;s never going to be simple with Samit Patel, is it? He is becoming a really useful part of this one-day side, though, and is having another decent day here. His figures are 6-0-22-1. &quot;In the aftermath of Valentine&apos;s Day I&apos;m far too tired to come up with a neat way to slip this into an e-mail, so this is a shameless request for a plug for something I wrote about cricket and rock music,&quot; says Dan Lucas. &quot;If anyone wants to suggest a better title I&apos;ll gladly amend it.&quot;  28th over: Pakistan 116-3 (target 251; Azhar 21, Misbah 5) How did Misbah get away with that? He premeditated a sweep at Swann, with the ball hitting the pad and then the bat before deflecting this far wide of leg stump. Kieswetter appealed for the stumping as well, but Misbah had dragged his back foot into the crease in time. This is really good stuff from England&apos;s spinners. The required run-rate is now above a run a ball. &quot;If Sara is a skier, she will know about Whistler,&quot; says Janet Stevens. &quot;If not, I recommend she doesn&apos;t go near the place. Unless, that is, she likes overpriced art shops and a pervasive smell of hamburgers. The Public Library&apos;s good, though - warm fire, comfortable armchairs, week&apos;s supply of the Globe and Mail ...&quot;  29th over: Pakistan 118-3 (target 251; Azhar 22, Misbah 6) Anderson is coming on for Patel. That&apos;s a slight surprise because the spinners were doing really well, with only 12 runs coming from the last four overs. Misbah again almost drags on. This time he inside edged the ball into the ground, from where it bounced up to hit him on the backside before dribbling wide of the stumps. Later in the over he inside edges a pull stroke into his stomach. He doesn&apos;t look comfortable at the crease, although we have seen in the past that he can switch gears at a stroke.  30th over: Pakistan 126-3 (target 251; Azhar 28, Misbah 8) Azhar Ali reverse sweeps Swann expertly for four. He is playing with impressive certainty in only his second ODI. In fact, he&apos;s playing like a man who scored a whitewash-clinching 157 in his previous innings for his country. Eight from the over, a good one for Pakistan. They need 125 from 120 balls. &quot;I&apos;ve been invited to go skiing in Banff,&quot; says Mike Selvey. &quot;Should I go?&quot; Yes. No. Sorry. (I have no idea, but I&apos;m sure our twos of readers will advise one way or the other.)  31st over: Pakistan 132-3 (target 251; Azhar 28, Misbah 13) Another wide from Anderson. England&apos;s seamers have been, by their extremely high standards, just a little sloppy tonight \u2013 that&apos;s the sixth wide of the innings. A couple of twos help make it a decent over for Pakistan. &quot;I am clearly going to have to try the Hawksmoor ribeye as soon as humanly possible, but I&apos;d also ask you to give a mention to the fillet at La Constancia near the southern side of Tower Bridge,&quot; says Mark Jelbert. &quot;I was close to tears of joy at one point. As a bonus you can have an Argentinian version of a pasty as a starter, or simply a plate of melted cheese. Heaven.&quot; Tears of joy are so 2011. When we go to the Hawksmoor now, and take our first mouthful, we all burst out laughing at how absurdly good it is.  32nd over: Pakistan 135-3 (target 251; Azhar 29, Misbah 15) Swann keeps Pakistan down to only three singles, a very good effort. Pakistan need 116 from 18 overs. &quot;TELL SELVEY TO GO TO BANFF,&quot; shouts Niall Smith. &quot;Apologies for the caps but it&apos;s amazing. The exchange rate is a pain but Canadians are almost universally unbelievably pleasant.&quot; More pleasant than Londoners? Not possible.  WICKET! Pakistan 142-4 (Azhar b Patel 31) Samit Patel strikes again! Azhar Ali was looking dangerous but he was beaten by an excellent quicker ball that zipped on to hit the off stump.  33rd over: Pakistan 143-4 (target 251; Misbah 20, U Akmal 1) &quot;Yesterday&apos;s link at the bottom of the fiver to the ski holiday article with John Ashdown and Rachel Dixon took me back to that glorious OBO from August 2010&apos;s 3rd Test between England and Pakistan,&quot; says Andrew Kelly. &quot;The fish pie scandal. Good to see they&apos;re still together... those were some tough times for their relationship.&quot;  34th over: Pakistan 149-4 (target 251; Misbah 24, U Akmal 2) Bopara comes on for Swann (8-0-33-0). This is the penultimate over before the batting Powerplay, so both sides are content with low-risk cricket. Four singles and a two make it six from the over. &quot;I don&apos;t know about Banff, but I&apos;m going to Barnsley at the weekend for a surprise 50th,&quot; says Graeme Anderson. &quot;Is it worth it?&quot;  35th over: Pakistan 151-4 (target 251; Misbah 25, U Akmal 3) Pakistan have a longish tail, having replaced Shoaib Malik with Abdur Rehman, so a huge amount depends on these two and Shahid Afridi. Umar Akmal gives Patel the charge and smokes the ball right back down the ground. Fortunately for England, it clatters into the stumps at the non-striker&apos;s end, saving four runs in the process. Two from Patel&apos;s over. Pakistan need 100 from 90 balls, and it&apos;s time for the batting Powerplay. &quot;All talk of fine steak aside, I&apos;ve a cricket related query,&quot; says Graham Parker. I&apos;m doing a Masters in September in Amsterdam, and I&apos;d like to continue playing cricket at a low level. Does anyone know of any piss-poor Amsterdamian cricket team who I can marvel with my English ways? And I refer to my girlfriend as &apos;Chuckles&apos;.&quot;  36th over: Pakistan 158-4 (target 251; Misbah 26, U Akmal 9) The prettiest brains trust in international cricket \u2013 Cook, Broad and Anderson \u2013 discuss what England should do next. Broad is coming into the attack. Umar Akmal gives his second ball the charge and smears it down the ground for four; three more singles make it a decent over for Pakistan. This game is poised as deliciously as Simon Adebisi&apos;s hat. &quot;I went to Banff for a day trip,&quot; says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. &quot;There was a blizzard and there might as well have been no mountains there at all. I couldn&apos;t see ANY. Which just makes it a fairly crap, overpriced town in which there is a mexican restaurant where it is someone&apos;s job to lower a sombrero onto your head from the other side of the room, via a pulley system as you enter, thus surprising you and entertaining your fellow diners. Plus I don&apos;t ski.  Another wasted day in my wast  Another great day in my life!&quot;  37th over: Pakistan 165-4 (target 251; Misbah 27, U Akmal 14) Steven Finn has been exceptional with the new ball in this series. How will he fare in the Powerplay overs, when batsmen are going after him? Akmal drags the second ball behind square for four, the start of what should be a fascinating little battle between two of world cricket&apos;s most exciting young talents. Finn concedes seven from the over, although it was another good one. &quot;To Sara Torvalds: if you&apos;re going to Vancouver, I&apos;d recommend the Museum of Anthropology if for no other reason that the building and site are fabulous,&quot; says Sharon Walz. &quot;And I second the previous recommendation for taking the gondola up Grouse Mountain, though only if you get one of the very, very rare Vancouver days when it isn&apos;t pouring (bring your rain gear regardless!), and a definite no to the Grind unless you have knees of steel and a couple of hours to kill climbing 600+ rickety stairs that seem purposely designed to kill the unwary.&quot;  38th over: Pakistan 170-4 (target 251; Misbah 29, U Akmal 17) Akmal lofts Broad back over his head for a couple before lapping on the bounce to short fine leg. Broad hurries a bouncer right through Misbah&apos;s attempted pull. Five from an excellent over. Pakistan are slightly ahead I would say. They need 81 from 72 balls. &quot;I don&apos;t have first-hand knowledge of Amsterdam cricket,&quot; says Pete Kingsley, &quot;but a friend of mine over there has a lot of fun with a club called VRA. They have lots of different teams for various abilities, ages and genders. They might be a good place for Graham Parker to start.&quot;  REVIEW! Pakistan 174-4 (Misbah not out 29) Misbah walks across a full, straight delivery from Finn, and the ball flies to the fine-leg boundary off the pad. That looked really close. Aleem Dar said not out, but Misbah had gone a long way across and the ball hit him on the back pad. I think this will be out... and I&apos;m wrong. Replays show it was hitting the outside of leg stump, so the original decision stands and England have lost their review.  WICKET! Pakistan 179-5 (Umar Akmal c Patel b Finn 21) Umar Akmal hammers Finn low to cover, where Patel takes a low catch and throws the ball up in celebration. Akmal hangs around, however, and the on-field umpires decide to go upstairs to see whether the ball carried to the fielder. That usually means a reprieve for the batsman. All cricket common sense suggests it was a clean take, and if so it was an extremely good low catch from Patel. The third umpire Simon Taufel is still looking at replays ... and he&apos;s been given out! That&apos;s brave umpiring from Taufel, and a really good catch from Patel. He has had an excellent couple of hours. That is a big wicket for England. One more and they are into the tail.  39th over: Pakistan 179-5 (target 251; Misbah 30, Afridi 0) &quot;Has anyone commented on how bad for TV audiences the white ball is under floodlights?&quot; says Jack Savidge. &quot;The ball is completely lost against the glare off the pitch all the way from hand to bat, and seeing the line and length is nigh on impossible. What on earth is the point of the white ball if it makes the glitzy TV product of Twenty20 and ODIs worse for the casual viewer? (If this sounds a bit pompous and sergeant-majorly, its because I&apos;m watching this in the Sports Bar on Haymarket, surely the worlds most diabolical place for watching cricket.)&quot; You say &apos;seeing the line and length is nigh on impossible&apos;. Surely that&apos;s just like being at the game? What more can you ask from TV?  40th over: Pakistan 180-5 (target 251; Misbah 31, Afridi 0) Misbah probably has to bat through if Pakistan are to win. He chips Broad down the ground for a single, bringing Afridi on strike. Broad drives him onto the back foot with some good short balls, the fourth of which roars past Afridi&apos;s attempted pull. &quot;Good pace on that. Good wheels,&quot; says Waqar Younis approvingly. The next ball beats Afridi as well. Outstanding stuff from Broad. &quot;For Sara going to Vancouver, from someone who lived there for 2.5 years,&quot; begins Asad Kiyani. &quot;A decent day in Vancouver: start at the Museum of Anthropology, scoot down to Granville Island for lunch, take a water taxi over to English Bay and then walk along the seawall to Stanley Park, hike up to the lookout point inside the Park itself, then have dinner at Kingyo, a nearby Japanese restaurant.&quot;  41st over: Pakistan 184-5 (target 251; Misbah 34, Afridi 1) Another fine over from Finn costs just four, so Pakistan need 67 from 54 balls. &quot;If, as was suggested on the BBC, the ball is shown to be hitting the stumps but close enough for the not out to stand as &apos;umpire&apos;s call&apos;, isn&apos;t there a good argument that the fielding side should not lose a review as they were right as well,&quot; says Adam Roberts. &quot;As Alan Partridges said &apos;You&apos;re right, you&apos;re right \u2026.. and so am I&apos;.&quot; That&apos;s definitely worth considering, yeah. The only danger is that it could all become quite confusing and long-winded, but it&apos;s certainly worth thinking about when they revise DRS, as they surely will.  42nd over: Pakistan 191-5 (need 60 runs from 48 balls; Misbah 37, Afridi 5) Afridi is dropped by Broad! He drove the new bowler Patel towards long off, from where Broad ran in and tumbled forward to take an outstanding low catch, only for the ball to burst out of his hands as the rest of his body hit the floor. Seven runs from the over, all in ones and twos.  43rd over: Pakistan 195-5 (need 56 runs from 42 balls; Misbah 39, Afridi 7) The new bowler Anderson beats Misbah with a fine delivery that jags away off the seam. Misbah then scoops an airy single back over the bowler&apos;s head. Four from the over, which is fine for England.  44th over: Pakistan 207-5 (need 44 runs from 36 balls; Misbah 40, Afridi 18) Shabash shabash Afridi! He has just manhandled Patel for 10 runs in two balls with a heave over long on and a scorching cover drive. Twelve from the over, and Patel ends with figures of 10-0-51-2. &quot;I once drove from Banff to Jasper along the Icefields Parkway with my, erm, significant other at the time, which is stunning and well worth a look (the road&apos;s not bad either! Honk),&quot; says Mark Jelbert. &quot;The shine was taken off by an incident along the way though \u2013 I saw a particularly huge crow in a layby and had to pull over and get out to take a closer look, while she stayed in the car. After a while she got bored waiting for me (it was really big, I took a while) and got out too, unfortunately assuming I&apos;d taken the keys with me and locking the doors. I hadn&apos;t. My window was open slightly, which tempted me to try to lever it open enough to get a hand in with a metal bar someone gave me, but I gave it a bit too much welly and shattered the window. The last 30 miles through the Canadian Rockies were pretty nippy, although it&apos;s hard to say whether the wind or her demeanour was frostier.&quot;  WICKET! Pakistan 207-6 (Afridi b Anderson 18) Got him! Afridi mows all round a straight delivery from Anderson that rams into middle stump. That wasn&apos;t the most responsible shot I suppose, but it&apos;s Afridi; this is what we sign up for. Anderson yells with delight. He knows that could be a matchwinning breakthrough.  45th over: Pakistan 207-6 (need 44 runs from 30 balls; Misbah 40, Rehman 0) Anderson is now England&apos;s joint leading wickettaker against Pakistan in ODIs. With 27. He almost makes it 28 with a good one that beats Abdur Rehman, the first of four consecutive dot balls to the new batsman. A wicket maiden from Anderson. Outstanding stuff. &quot;Finally got tickets for 1st Day of England v South Africa at Lord&apos;s,&quot; says Keith Flett. &quot;\u00a3180 &amp; a flash of my Tory Party card secured them...&quot; I missed out in the ballot for day two tickets. Bah!  46th over: Pakistan 213-6 (need 38 runs from 24 balls; Misbah 45, Rehman 0) Misbah guides Broad&apos;s first ball wide of Morgan at backward point for four, a superb stroke. He&apos;s happy to take a single off the next ball, which puts Rehman (ODI batting average 7.18) on strike. He is a No10, not a No8, and he demonstrates that by missing the first three balls he faces from Broad. &quot;This is just not good enough,&quot; says Nasser Hussain on Sky. Rehman has nought from eight balls. &quot;He should retire himself,&quot; says Ramiz Raja, only half-jokingly.  WICKET! Pakistan 217-7 (Rehman b Finn 1) Finn puts Rehman out of his misery. The ball after being bowled off a free hit, Rehman is bowled again, beaten completely for pace. He made one from 12 balls, and may have won the match for England.  47th over: Pakistan 217-7 (need 34 runs from 18 balls; Misbah 47, Gul 0) &quot;My children call my wife &apos;Mama&apos; and call me &apos;Pete&apos;,&quot; says Pete Connolly. &quot;Should I tell them I am their father?&quot;  WICKET! Pakistan 217-8 (Misbah c Kieswetter b Broad 47) What a wonderful catch from Craig Kieswetter! Misbah tried to lift Broad over the leg side but instead spooned the ball over the keeper&apos;s head, dizzingly high in the air. The ball was swirling horribly as Kieswetter ran back towards the boundary. He appeared to have misjudged the line of it, but then dived full length to his right to take a one-handed catch. Sensational work from Kieswetter, because that was a truly hideous skier. Surely England have won this match now.  48th over: Pakistan 222-8 (need 29 runs from 12 balls; Gul 4, Ajmal 0) Umar Gul pings a short ball from Broad over midwicket for a fantastic one-bounce four. He can hit the ball devastatingly well, and goodness knows why he came in below Rehman. &quot;Is it too soon for me to be buying effigies futures?&quot; says Gary Naylor.  WICKET! Pakistan 222-9 (Gul LBW b Finn 5) Nearly done. Finn traps Umar Gul LBW with a superb yorker that hits him on the back foot. Gul reviewed the decision, probably in the hope of a no-ball as much as anything, but that was absolutely plumb. Finn has three for 26 today and seven for 70 in the series. He is going to make a helluva lot of batsmen crave the serenity of the non-striker&apos;s end over the next 10 years.  WICKET! Pakistan 230 all out (Cheema b Finn 1). ENGLAND WIN BY 20 RUNS! Finn knocks back Cheema&apos;s middle stump, and England go 2-0 up in the four-match series. This has been an excellent victory. They had to work much harder than in the first match, which will make it a lot more rewarding. In other important respects, as Nasser points out on Sky, this was Groundhog Day: a brilliant century from Cook, a fifty from Bopara, and figures of 10-1-34-4 from the outstanding Finn.

Ajax against Manchester United in the imposing Amsterdam ArenA, four European Cups against three, 30 league titles against 19, one fertile breeding ground for homegrown talent against another and two legendary club figures in the respective dug-outs. Then the music starts and United&apos;s players will resemble aged clubbers on a rare night out, shuffling uncomfortably and muttering, &quot;I don&apos;t know this one&quot;. Welcome to the Europa League. For the first time since losing to Rotor Volgograd on away goals in the first round of the 1995-96 Uefa Cup, European football&apos;s second tier is home for United following failure to finish above Benfica and Basel in their Champions League group. Sir Alex Ferguson left Amsterdam vowing never to return on his last visit with United six years ago, or to the pre-season tournament that bears its name at least, after Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes were reported to the Football Association for red cards in a friendly against Porto (the former for an elbow on Pepe, now of Real Madrid) and served with three-match domestic suspensions. If it pains him to be back while the Champions League goes on without the finalists in three of the past four seasons, Ferguson is disguising it well. Asked how it felt to be present in the Europa League, the United manager said: &quot;I feel good about it. It&apos;s a tournament we are going to try to win. We have a responsibility to do better after the disappointment of earlier in the season. We have an opportunity to do better and, when you look at the Europa League, it&apos;s a challenge. The disappointment of the Champions League is gone. We have many young players who don&apos;t have great experience of Europe so that should be enough motivation for them. The final is in Romania, I want to be there, so do my supporters and I won&apos;t find motivation difficult.&quot; Complacency undoubtedly played a part in United&apos;s exit from the Champions League group stage and not only in the form of talking up their prospects of beating Barcelona before the competition had commenced. As Ferguson volunteered, it was also evident in his team selections. He said: &quot;I will certainly try to play my strongest team in each round now. I think we were depending on our previous form in group stages in the Champions League this year. We were making changes each year and it was working fine for us because our home record was so good. But we threw it away against Basel in the home game and were unlucky against Benfica. That caught us short, to be honest with you, and we suffered for it.&quot; Patrice Evra has been left behind in Manchester, however, as a consequence of his confrontation with Liverpool, and in particular Luis Su\u00e1rez, on Saturday. &quot;We have rested Patrice because I think it was an emotional weekend for him and it was the right thing to do,&quot; his manager said. United&apos;s fall from European grace is relative, of course. Compared with Ajax, who have not reached the quarter-finals of any European competition since 2003 and remain distracted by Johan Cruyff&apos;s legal dispute with the board over their proposed appointment of Louis van Gaal as chief executive, this season&apos;s European campaign appears a mere detour. There was audible disapproval when Frank de Boer, the Ajax coach, said his coveted Danish midfielder, Christian Eriksen, could &quot;play for a big team like Manchester United in the future&quot;. De Boer was asked how sad it was that Ajax could not be mentioned in such terms. &quot;You just have to look at the facts,&quot; he replied. &quot;Look at the difference in turnover between the clubs and the difference in revenue from TV contracts there is between England and the Netherlands.We lose our big players now to the bigger leagues around the age of 23. I left here at 28. I would tell any player here that it is better to stay until you are 25 years old because you learn a lot about football and you are a more stable player who is able to play in the bigger leagues. We have a very talented youth department, though, and the way we develop players gives me a good feeling for the future.&quot; Ajax (4-2-3-1, probable): Vermeer; Anita, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Boilesen; Eriksen, Aissati; Sulejmani, De Jong, Ebecilio; Bulykin.

They had flowery meadows and rainbow skies, and rivers made of chocolate, where the children danced and laughed and played with gumdrop smiles.&quot; Oh no, silly me, that wasn&apos;t the real Sean Penn, that was his puppet from Team America: World Police. In truth, the Hollywood star met Argentina&apos;s president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, in Buenos Aires and said: &quot;It&apos;s necessary that these diplomatic talks happen between the United Kingdom and Argentina. I think that the world today is not going to tolerate any kind of ludicrous and archaic commitment to colonialist ideology.&quot; Cue the inevitable outburst of anger, outrage and mockery from patriotic Brits, and (according to Google News) 479 newspaper articles around the world. The consensus on social media, the inescapable modern barometer of public feeling, was that Penn should stop meddling and keep his views to himself. How dare he hold an opinion on issues of international geopolitics? Tens of thousands of Twitter and Facebook users spluttered their belief that Penn is unqualified, ill-informed and wrong. Perhaps he is wrong. Certainly his statement didn&apos;t acknowledge the crucial principles of self-determination enshrined in international law. On the other hand, perhaps he has taken on board issues around South Atlantic oil exploration zones, mineral reserves and fishing rights and concluded that there are rather larger stakes at play here than the nationality status of a few thousand British sheep farmers and fishing workers. I don&apos;t know, but I wouldn&apos;t rule out the possibility that Sean Penn, whether we agree with him or not, may be considerably better informed than the vast majority of those pointing and laughing or yelling. At the heart of this transient kerfuffle is the question of whether celebrities, be they actors, pop stars, footballers or whoever, should use their position and profile to opine on matters of politics. What is often forgotten is that there is a profound difference between expressing a view and exercising influence. Celebrities have a platform, but that is not the same as power. No government policy has ever been dictated by an actor&apos;s opinion. Well, apart from Ronald Reagan from 1980-88, but nobody minded that because the Americans, in their infinite wisdom, gave him the role. Or there is big Arnie in California, of course, which doesn&apos;t count for the same reason. Oh, and Joanna Lumley, but, well, you know, she&apos;s really Purdey and everyone loves the Gurkhas and despises Phil Woolas, so that&apos;s OK then. That&apos;s how these things work. Most of us are happy when celebrities, particularly popular ones, express opinions we agree with. As soon as they say something we don&apos;t like, suddenly they&apos;re getting ideas above their station and meddling. It seems to me we can&apos;t have it both ways. Either we give space to those in the public eye to express their views or we face a pop culture landscape of bland, stultifying, issue avoidance. If they say things that are wrong, tell them so. If they say things that are silly \u2013 Sheryl Crow&apos;s advice on saving the planet one sheet of toilet tissue at a time springs to mind \u2013 then laugh at them. But laugh at them for what they say, not because they said it at all. Of course it is not always easy for a celebrity to pull off the opinion-forming trick. They will come to grief if their views are accompanied by an attitude of entitlement. This is what I call the Bono effect: &quot;I&apos;m a millionaire rock star, I demand the crusts be cut off my sandwiches, my favourite hat be flown in from Amsterdam, and Africa&apos;s exogenic debt crisis be resolved before I will consider playing in your shitty stadium.&quot; It is really this type of arrogance and self-aggrandisement that Parker and Stone were mocking in Team America, and it is a line that Penn in particular might sometimes cross. But, whether from left or right or wherever in between, I&apos;d rather have celebrities expressing real opinions than the alternative \u2013 like this from Britney Spears: &quot;Honestly, I think we should just trust our president in every decision he makes and should just support that, you know, and be faithful in what happens.&quot; Should Penn have an opinion about the Falklands? Should Joey Barton have views on the Occupy movement? Should Justin Bieber have an opinion on abortion? Hell, yes. Everyone should have an opinion on those things, whether actor, pop star, butcher, baker or candlestick maker, and share them without fear or favour.

Although they all give detailed descriptions of how you back up, none of them describes how to restore. If you lose your hard drive suddenly, but are backed up in a cloud application, can you restore the whole hard disk, applications and data in one operation?RL SymondsIf you are using cloud storage, then a server keeps copies of your hard drive somewhere on the internet, probably encrypted for security reasons. You can&apos;t access those files unless you have an internet connection and perhaps a copy of the cloud service&apos;s client (PC) software as well. I don&apos;t see how all that can be done in one restore operation. It&apos;s certainly not as simple as restoring a disk image from a local drive, as discussed here in January. If you suddenly lost your hard drive, you would normally use a restore partition, if available, or a drive image, after booting Windows from a recovery CD, DVD or thumb drive. Third-party boot-and-restore utilities are often based on a small version of Linux, but you could also use any Live Linux CD to get online. So, if you have a recovery CD or a Live Linux CD, plus any software that your online backup service requires, then you can indeed restore your PC from the cloud. With Carbonite and probably some other services, you can restore a complete backup if you can get to the site in a web browser. This is useful, but I would not recommend it as your primary backup strategy. Things are different with mobile phones and other devices where the operating system is stored on a Rom chip, and where &quot;restore from cloud&quot; may be a simple menu option. Phones have built-in connectivity, and there is relatively little data to back up. PCs are not designed to work like that, and it&apos;s not unusual for people to have 500GB or even a terabyte (1TB) of data. Size matters, for two reasons. First, it can take a long time to upload and then download 500GB or 1TB of data. It&apos;s much quicker to restore from an external hard drive (EHD), as mentioned, or from a local fileserver such as a Windows Home Server or Apple Time Machine. Second, it costs a lot of money to keep data in the cloud. Cloud services typically offer 2GB to 5GB of free storage to get you going, but after that, they charge a monthly fee. If you want to back up a whole PC, you could end up paying \u00a310-\u00a320 per month for storage, which is \u00a3120-\u00a3240 per year, or \u00a3600-\u00a31,200 over five years. You can buy several terabytes of fast, local storage for that sort of money. Memopal, which was founded in Italy, is a cheap option, and offers good discounts for signing multi-year deals. Storing 300GB (the highest amount offered to personal users) costs \u20ac69 for one year and \u20ac213.90 (rather than \u20ac345) for five years. You could buy a 500GB or larger hard drive for the first year&apos;s cost (\u00a357) and several terabytes for the five-year cost (\u00a3178). Cloud storage does have some advantages. You get an off-site backup that will still be there if your house is burgled or burns to the ground, and you can access your files from different PCs or even from smartphones and tablets. This also makes it simpler to share files with other people. Against that, cloud storage brings some significant risks. You can lose access to your account, your data can become corrupted, or the cloud service provider can delete it either by accident or deliberately because you haven&apos;t paid your bills. Worse, web-based companies frequently go bust. I experienced these problems after uploading some files to Streamload, an award-winning service launched in 1998. The company lost a lot of data transitioning to new software, got taken over, and then closed down. It didn&apos;t matter because I had everything backed up locally, but Streamload had 20,000 paying customers (as well as countless freeloaders), and I don&apos;t think everyone did.  I&apos;m not suggesting that you should never use cloud services. I use Dropbox and Microsoft&apos;s SkyDrive (25GB free) to back up and share photos and Office documents from smartphones: it&apos;s very handy to have photos automatically uploaded and/or automatically copied to a PC. It means I&apos;m less likely to lose valuable files. Nonetheless, I still back them up to one or more EHDs, and sometimes to CD-R discs. The cloud isn&apos;t my primary backup, and only a small proportion of my files are in the cloud, but it&apos;s still useful. Not all cloud services are the same, but there are two basic approaches. Some provide a sort of &quot;magic folder&quot; or virtual online drive where you can put files that you want to back up. This is the idea behind Dropbox. With other services, you select one or more existing folders and have them backed up on a continuous basis. For example, you could have the service monitor directories of My Documents and My Photos, knowing that whenever you changed files in those folders, the changes would be backed up online. Mozy and SugarSync are popular examples of this kind of service, and Memopal works in the same way. (This partly answers a separate query from Andrew White.) Which you prefer is, of course, a matter of taste. However, the continuous backup approach tends to consume more resources, so you should use the service&apos;s trial period to make sure the cloud&apos;s constant monitoring software doesn&apos;t slow your PC. Cloud services should be smart enough to back up the changes to a file without uploading the whole file again. The &quot;diff&quot; approach makes it easy to keep backups of many different versions of a file. Services should also be smart enough not to back up files they have already uploaded from someone else. Even Streamload did that. There are plenty of files \u2013 such as operating system files and iTunes and Amazon downloads \u2013 that are identical on millions of different hard drives. Indeed, charging thousands of users for the same small bit of storage is where cloud services should be able to make money. In his query, Andrew White also asked for a cloud storage service that was &quot;preferably based in the UK&quot;. There may be some but, sorry, I can&apos;t think of one.  Large cloud services providers, such as Microsoft, typically have large data centres on different continents. The best Microsoft will do with its Office 365 service is keep your data in Europe, in Dublin and/or Amsterdam, rather than (say) Chicago, San Antonio, Singapore or Hong Kong. Smaller cloud service providers, including Dropbox, often use Amazon&apos;s very reasonably priced Simple Storage Service (S3) , so data is probably held in the US: Amazon has data centres in northern California (us-west-1), North Virginia (us-east-1), Ireland (eu-west-1) and Singapore (ap-southeast-1). However, Amazon caches data in many other places, including London and Tokyo. I&apos;m not sure it makes any practical difference where data is stored. The US government can get it under the terms of the Patriot Act if it&apos;s kept by an American company or one that does business in the US, even if it&apos;s a European company. You might find cloud storage in a country that won&apos;t give your data to US or European government agents on request, such as Russia or China, but would that be a satisfactory solution? With cloud services, you really don&apos;t have much protection unless you pay business prices and sign an SLA (Service Level Agreement). Even then, it would be wise to read the fine print very carefully.", "sentences": ["The best Microsoft will do with its Office 365 service is keep your data in Europe, in Dublin and/or Amsterdam, rather than (say) Chicago, San Antonio, Singapore or Hong Kong."], "title": "Is it worth backing up to the cloud? | Ask Jack", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2012/feb/16/ask-jack-backup-cloud-computing", "tags": ["Technology", "Cloud computing", "Computing", "Internet", "Windows", "Apple", "Microsoft", "Smartphones"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-16T19:54:00Z", "article": " Preamble: Ajax v Manchester United. There&apos;s a fixture to stir the heart. Four European Cups plays three. Thirty league titles plays 19. Two teams whose past players read like a roll call of the greatest players of all time: Cruyff, Van Basten, Bergkamp, Overmars, Seedorf, Kluivert, Rijkaard, Laudrup, Davids, Ibrahimovic, Arnesen ... Then Best, Charlton, Hughes, Keane, Robson, Cantona et al.  And here we all are seeing this history, one of the game&apos;s epic clashes, in the Europa League. On Channel 5. Sheesh. It&apos;s a competition recently described by the Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson as &quot;a punishment&quot; and is the first time the two clubs have met competitively outside the Champions League in 17 years. It doesn&apos;t feel quite as much like The Big One as it once did, does it? Ajax are a club in the midst of a civil war too. Boardroom wrangling, with Johan Cruyff at its heart, has ripped apart relationships at the top of the club. On the pitch, the club&apos;s pedigree is unrecognisable too. They&apos;re sixth in the Eredivisie, eight points below leaders PSV Eindhoven. They&apos;ve won just one league title in seven years (last year, in fact) and have won only one of their four league games this year.  Manchester United, meanwhile, appear to be trying to convince themselves this is something they care about. The noise from their camp has been all about how they&apos;re trying to win the tournament - but it appears they&apos;re words delivered through the gritted teeth. &quot;We need to get used to the fact we are not in the Champions League this season,&quot; said Javier Hernandez before the match. Fergie added: &quot;winning any European trophy is significant. Irrespective of those who have won the three trophies before it is important for us, with our own history, to win tournaments all the time.&quot;  Both teams are a footballing sides, though, so with luck everyone can ignore the shabbier backdrop the Europa League provides and this can entertain. My prediction is Ajax 1-3 Manchester United.  Team news: Ajax: Vermeer, Anita, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Koppers, De Jong, Aissati, Eriksen, Ozbiliz, Bulykin, Sulejmani. Subs: Cillessen, Boilesen, Blind, Lodeiro, Serero, Van Rhijn, Lukoki Manchester United: De Gea, Jones, Ferdinand, Evans, Fabio, Nani, Carrick, Cleverley, Young, Rooney, Hernandez. Subs: Amos, Smalling, Park, Welbeck, Scholes, Valencia, Pogba  5.36pm: The United lineup is an attacking one, and they&apos;ll be up against the classic Ajax 4-3-3. Could be a chance for Young and Nani to make hay up their respective wings - or, alternatively, could be a chance for the Dutch side&apos;s attackers to make mincemeat of a creaky defence seeking to attack. Meanwhile, Peter Yates has emailed to point out: &quot;How about: Edwards, Best, Charlton, Hughes, Keane, Robson, Cantona et al. I&apos;m sure Bobby Charlton would agree that Duncan Edwards should be the first name on that list. &quot;  5.40pm: &quot;It&apos;s great to see Cleverley playing again for United,&quot; says Richard Berry. &quot;I don&apos;t think he is as world class as people made him out to be while he was injured and he probably got over hyped, but his ability to just pass quickly and keep the ball moving meant we could play such a high tempo at the beginning of the season. Intrigued to see how we will get on tonight.&quot; They just seem to play better when he&apos;s on the pitch - it&apos;s his European debut tonight after returning from the ankle injury he suffered against Everton.  5.51pm: Ajax are expecting a 50,000 capacity full house. However, they may be a few short of that after 76 Ajax fans were arrested last night having been found with brass knuckles, clubs, teargas and &quot;a large amount of narcotics&quot;. Yikes.  5.53pm: Sir Alex Ferguson is in the tunnel. Roughly, here&apos;s what he has to say. &quot;If you&apos;re in a tournament, you want to win it. The Champions League has gone. [Ajax] will be good as always. They&apos;ve always produced young, clever footballers. That&apos;s been their philosophy for many years and we&apos;ll get that tonight. Hopefully we can get the result.&quot;  5.58pm: There&apos;s quite the atmosphere at the Amsterdam ArenA. The fans are waving banners like their lives depend on it, while the PA is pumping out the tunes like its 3am at the Hacienda. None of the tunes are this, though.  Peep, peep: It&apos;s cold, it&apos;s noisy and we&apos;re off. Hernandez has completed his pre-match chat with The Man Upstairs, has knocked the ball to Rooney and United have passed it around the back.  2 min: In fact, United spend a good length of time passing it around the back. Eventually De Gea hoofs it long and Ajax get on the ball. They make a tentative attack, Eriksen swinging the ball into the box but to nobody.  3 min: Vertonghen goes on a charge up the middle then offloads. Ajax build slowly before Vertonghen again takes control of the ball. He fires a long ball forward for Bulykin but it goes too far and into touch.  4 min: &quot;Regarding your header picture,&quot; emails Adrian Gentry. &quot;Did Lord Ferg lose a bet on the 6 nations and have to wear the Welsh RFU hat this evening?&quot;  5 min: Eriksen lingers on the ball 10 yards outside the United box. He offloads then picks up the ball again, passing out to Ozbiliz on the wing. He crosses to Bulykin in the box, but his touch lets him down. Ajax have started decently.  6 min: Nani collects from Carrick and goes on a mazy little run into the Ajax box. His shot is easily knocked behind for a corner, though. The winger then proceeds to thump his corner kick straight out of play behind the goal.  7 min: Ajax attempt to play De Jong in after some near triangles up their right. Ferdinand intercepts and clears though.  9 min: It&apos;s a little ponderous so far. Each team is allowing the other plenty of room, and so the passing has been slow and languid, without being penetrating. Finally Evans makes a dart for the Dutch side&apos;s box. He passes out wide to Young on the left, who tries a couple of stepovers then earns a corner.  10 min: Carrick heads the ball goalwards, but Ajax - after a little while - can get the ball safely up the pitch. Not a single one of them chases the clearance though. Instead, they sit back deep and wait for United. Hernandez calls for the ball but is marginally offside when it comes.  13 min: Eriksen takes up a position on the edge of the United D, then passes out wide to Sulejmani on the left wing. His cross is perfect - a nice height, across the face of the goal and there for the attacking - except for one thing: it doesn&apos;t go anywhere near an Ajax player.  14 min: After United attempt an attack, Ajax come back at them. Well, sort of. Ozbiliz comes forward up the right and pings in a cross from several miles out. It goes straight to De Gea. Then, again, he goes up the right and crosses more successfully. Evans has to clear into touch.  14 min: From the throw-in, Eriksen gets the beating of Carrick and so the United midfielder and Ferdinand combine to bundle the ball out for a corner. Nothing comes of it though.  15 min: Rooney blazes up the United right and, with three players in the penalty area, his cross gets deflected behind everyone. Meanwhile Ashley Young appears to be in some discomfort. Not sure why yet.  16 min: &quot;Re. 5 mins: &apos;Ajax have started decently&apos;?&quot; emails Pramod Hegde before using up his full nightly quota of punctuation marks: &quot;Imagine if they had started indecently?!?!&quot;  18 min: A loose pass from Jones to Nani is intercepted by Koppers. The left back goes charging into the area but his shot is tame. De Gea saves easily. Still, a mistake there from the United right back.  19 min: Young seems to have shrugged off whatever was bothering him. He scoops a flicked pass over the Ajax defence for Hernandez to run onto. The Mexican is offside though. A moment later, Rooney comes trundling up to the box. Caught in two minds between blasting a long range shot and placing one, he doesn&apos;t really do either. Vermeer hops into the air and clutches the ball to his chest.  20 min: &quot;Not sure I get all this Europa League dissing,&quot; emails Paul Taylor. &quot;From this seat the Champions League looks like a place where good English teams go to get the stuffing knocked out of them and come home disgraced if not shambleized (as Radar would put it). Are we having just a spot of trouble adjusting to the fact that we are no longer king of the road?&quot; Well, it was Ferguson who called it a &quot;punishment&quot; and, really, a club like Manchester United ought not to be competing in the Europa League.  21 min: Nani tricks his way into a crossing position on the right. With Hernandez waiting expectantly, the swings the ball into the area but Vertonghen leaps highest and clears.  22 min: Hernandez goes charging through to meet a defence-splitting pass. The keeper Vermeer comes flying odd his goal line too, though, and just beats the striker to it.  23 min: The hat mystery: resolved. &quot;Evening Tom!&quot; cheers a cheery Ryan Dunne. &quot;The Wales hat was famously a gift from Ryan Giggs, which Ferguson has continued to wear for reasons of luck (which, given Man U&apos;s haul of trophies in his tenure, does make a certain sense). I wonder if any of Man U&apos;s England players have tried to get him to wear some 3 lion themed clothing?&quot;  26 min: Ajax pass their way forwards from the back. They make it about two-thirds of the way up the pitch before they face the massed ranks of the United defence. United don&apos;t seem too unhappy to let them keep passing, especially as they&apos;re mostly going sideways. Eventually, after a throw-in, Manchester United win the ball and head forwards themselves. It&apos;s then Ajax&apos;s turn to stop them. Ho hum.  28 min: Plenty of passing again which finally leads to a breakthrough of sorts. Sulejmani swings over a booming cross after the centre-back Vertonghen again came streaming forwards with the ball. Bulykin went up for a good chance but couldn&apos;t quite connect properly as Evans cleared. As the ball trickles back, De Jong is there to have a crack but it bounces back off his own man. Up the other end, Rooney then has a crack of his own.  29 min: Nani creeps in on the right of the Ajax box. With Rooney and Hernandez screaming for the ball he instead shoots from an impossible angle. The ball balloons up, over the goal and into the crowd. Fergie shakes his head ruefully on the touchline.  31 min: &quot;Re: Europa League bashing,&quot; writes Stefan Lutter. &quot;Perhaps if United think themselves too good to grace the Europa League, they should have given it a bit more thought before getting spanked twice by FC Basel. If anything, Ajax should be the ones still in the competition, as their group included Madrid and Lyon and it took an absurd chain of events to eliminate them.&quot;  31 min: Hernandez, onside this time, races forwards to get hold of a through ball. Vermeer is awake, though, and claims again.  33 min: De Jong has a wicked crack at goal. From 35 yards out, he sends an absolute missile at the top corner. De Gea does what he does best though: he makes a spectacular save. From the resulting corner, the keeper does what he does worst. He flaps a bit, but eventually gets the ball out.  34 min: Another high ball comes over from United and De Gea remains rooted to his line. Vertonghen, who appears to be everywhere, heads goalwards. There follows a succession of Ajax crosses - two in fact - and the last of them is finally headed over. Good pressure from the home side.  37 min: Ajax are being more adventurous now, and are finding some success in probing the United flanks. United aren&apos;t letting them have it all their own way. They attack too. Eventually, the ball breaks to Cleverley who has a a booming and wild shot high over the Ajax cross bar. &quot;There&apos;s a certain irony in a man called Cleverley playing against Ajax isn&apos;t there?&quot; writes Gary Naylor. &quot;Best vs Cruyff? I think Cruyff was the more beautiful - which is not something one says often when George Best is the comparator.&quot;  38 min: Eriksen aims up a sighter from distance. From the centre of the park, he swings one at De Gea from a way out. It&apos;s a simple enough stop, though. There are, apparently, a clutch of British scouts here to watch the young midfielder tonight. He favours a move to Barcelona apparently. For a change.  40 min: Evans threads a ball through to Hernandez, who probably wasn&apos;t expecting it. The striker twists and turns and wins a throw-in near the corner flag. But from a decent position, United end up back in their own half playing the ball ponderously sideways.  42 min: Jones crosses for Hernandez and Rooney to head goalwards but Vertonghen clears. A moment later, Fabio crosses from the left flank for Nani. He goes down in a heap making all sorts of accusations about why he&apos;s gone down in a heap. The referee looks at him with faint disgust.  43 min: Graham Taylor, on the telly, has just pointed out that there is not much movement in the United team. Always hard to tell these sorts of things from the telly as you can&apos;t see the whole pitch. So let&apos;s take his word for it: there&apos;s not enough movement in the United side.  45 min: De Jong crosses to high for Bulykin and the big lad for Ajax makes only a half-hearted effort to climb for it. United get hold of the ball and probe up the right. However Sulejmani rides his luck, nicks the ball, and attacks. He passes to Ozbiliz on the left and he crosses back to the striker. Ferdinand is there, on the very edge of the box, and he lunges in ... there&apos;s a big penalty shout but the ref says no. And with that, it&apos;s half time.  An email to keep you going during the long, lonely minutes that make up half time: &quot;I read earlier that Ferguson was potentially touting Giggs as his successor when he eventually retires,&quot; writes David Wall. &quot;That might be a nice option at some point in the future, but what I don&apos;t understand is the opposition to Mourinho taking over their club from fans of both United and Arsenal. Some line about playing negative, purely pragmatic football is usually trotted out but that just seems ignorant to me. Have people seen Real Madrid this season? Not only are they running away from the supposedly invincible Barcelona in the league but they&apos;re doing so playing extremely versatile and attacking football. Mourinho is nothing if not pragmatic, but that includes adapting to the style required by a club. If he can keep the Madridistas from waving their hankies at him I&apos;m sure he could satisfy the principles at United or Arsenal.&quot; Once you&apos;ve got through that, I should successfully have got down to the canteen and back.  Half time: There&apos;s a Dutch cover band at the Amsterdam ArenA. They&apos;re playing a Kings Of Leon cover. &quot;Ajax is on fiyaaarrrrrrr!!!!&quot; It&apos;s quite bad.  Clickety, clack: The teams are trotting back out. No changes for United, despite Nani being an almost total waste of everyone&apos;s time tonight.  46 min: Cleverly passes right to Hernandez, he keeps the ball moving out to Nani. He&apos;s on the edge of the box and, with everyone expecting a cross, he pings a shot at the Ajax goal. Vermeer tickles it over.  47 min: From the corner, Ashley Young completely does the Ajax defender. He crosses back to Jones but the right-back has a fresh air swipe.  49 min: United have come out as if someone has put a rocket up their behinds at half time. Wonder who that could have been. Jones comes charging up the right again before Ajax can clear. They work the ball long to Bulykin who fires a shot so wide that he perhaps needs to go and have a little sit down and think about what his life has become.  50 min: &quot;Couldn&apos;t help noticing that in the picture at the top of the page, Hernandez looks more horizontal than vertical as the caption suggests,&quot; emails Dan Ashworth. &quot;Presumably he was vertical before he clashed with the keeper. Seems like a pretty dull game - time for Scholsey to earn his keep in the second half.&quot; Well done Dan, you win a prize. That&apos;s changed now.  51 min: Jones is venturing forwards a lot more this half. He passes to Rooney in the middle, he slips the ball through to Hernandez. One on one with the keeper, he goes down in a heap. It was *just* a good save by the keeper, though Hernandez was looking for a penalty. The ref doesn&apos;t give it.  52 min: Shortly after that, Fabio earns himself a yellow for a slightly wild challenge. Next Nani crosses from the right and Rooney leaps high. The Dutch defender gets the last touch and Vermeer has to touch the ball around the post. United are playing with much more gusto now.  54 min: De Jong gets a yellow now after a poor pass from Vermeer means he has to bring Young down to claim the ball. United take the free-kick short in an attempt to work the ball forwards up the left. It doesn&apos;t work: Ajax press them back into their own half where they start again.  55 min: After heading up the left again, Aissati concedes a foul and United again have a free-kick, this time on the left. Young crosses for Rooney and the ball gets nodded back to Cleverley. He attempts to chip the ball over the Ajax defence for Hernandez, who wins a corner. Ajax manage to clear that, though.  56 min: &quot;The Kings of Leon cover is &apos;quite bad&apos;?&quot; asks Ben Stanley. &quot;So, an improvement on the original, then?&quot;  57 min: Nani gets one over on Koppers and earns United another corner. Ajax have been pegged back this half. Carrick tries to flick the corner goalwards but there&apos;s no-one there to meet his efforts.  GOAL! Ajax 0-1 Manchester United (Young, 58min): Young finds Fabio on the overlap. He passes the ball back from the goal-line, inside the penalty area. It&apos;s another corner for United. They can&apos;t do anything with this one, but then Nani crosses again. The ball bobbles across the area and finds Young, unmarked, and he pings it in from 10 yards.  60 min: United&apos;s pressure and pace in the second half pays off. Meanwhile, Scholes comes on for Cleverly and Van Rhijn has come on for Bulykin.  61 min: Ozbiliz finds himself with the ball on the edge of the area after a Fabio error. He blazes the ball a metre or so over the bar.  62 min: This is lovely from Jon Wilde: &quot;Say what you like about Ajax. They had the best Subbuteo kit of the lot of &apos;em. Probably still do, for that matter. My brother was so in awe of Cruyff, he painted the face of his No9 Ajax player gold to make him stand out.&quot;  64 min: Koppers, who has been having a tough time at left back, has been yanked off the pitch. Boilesen, who is the first choice but has been injured, replaces him. He&apos;s just in time to see Nani claim the ball unmarked in the penalty area and then hoof high. He insists the keeper got a touch. The referee insists he didn&apos;t.  66 min: Evans chips the ball forward into the box. Well chip suggests there was finesse. It was more like the sort of up &apos;n&apos; under a second row forward puts up. Nani gives him the thumbs up anyway as the ball skids into touch.  67 min: Ajax find themselves in the rare position of having the ball on the edge of the United area. They pass it about, looking for a chink, until a United foot comes in to knock it back to De Gea. A moment later, they&apos;re back. This time Eriksen does see a chance - but his shot bobbles into De Gea&apos;s arms.  70 min: A long range Vertonghen shot goes scruffily wide, before Sulejmani gets onto a run. Phil Jones clatters him over, having given the ball away in the first place. Eriksen chips the ball into the box and United head it back out. From the clearance, Rooney tries to find Nani - but the forward is muscled off the ball.  71 min: Rooney plays Young through - and Young goes sprawling all over the ground when about to burst into the box. The referee waves play on. One of those odd ones where it was either a dive or a foul, but the ref has given neither.  72 min: Ah, there&apos;s the replay. The merest of Dutch hands waved near Young and he went down. So a dive, then.  73 min: Young goes down again after a challenge from Vertonghen. The Ajax defender came in from behind and there was contact this time, but that doesn&apos;t stop him having a right old shout at the United man. &quot;I was fond of the Ajax subbuteo team too,&quot; emails Justin Kavannagh. &quot;Except no matter how hard I drilled them, I could never get them to replicate the constant movement of Total Football.&quot;  73 min: Good lord, the Ajax crowd are loud. They&apos;ve burst to life because Eriksen has taken charge of the ball and gone racing up the middle of the pitch. His shot from the edge of the area is good and firm, but is nonetheless easily saved by De Gea.  76 min: Hernandez crosses from the byline to the centre-spot. But Rooney hadn&apos;t made a run to get to it. Meanwhile Young follows Cleverley in heading off the pitch - both players coming back from injury - and Valencia trots on. That will probably make United stronger, even though it was Young who scored.  77 min: Valencia immediately plays a slide-rule ball to Hernandez who shrugs off the complaints of handball from the Ajax players and wins a corner. However Ajax clear and counter immediately: and it&apos;s that man Vertonghen (a central defender) who&apos;s leading it. He&apos;s either all about the total football, or he&apos;s the new David Luiz.  78 min: United play it around the back, for De Gea to eventually hoof long. &quot;I&apos;ve always loved Johan Cruyff,&quot; emails a wistful Ian Burch. &quot;I saw him and Beckenbauer turn out for New York Cosmos against Chelsea back in 1978. Cruyff did his turn and a number of other tricks and they put an extra 20,000 people on the gate that night. Of course a lot of the fans may well have turned up just to catch a glimpse of Dennis Tueart playing up front for them.&quot;  79 min: Ozbiliz comes off for Ajax, the Dutch Under-19 international (it says here) Lukoki comes on. On the pitch, Sulejmani plays a through ball to De Gea. Not intentionally, obviously.  81 min: Van Rhijn hacks across a violent cross but Ferdinand is there to clear. Ajax just beginning to get a groove on at the moment.  82 min: The home side play a through ball for Van Rhijn to run onto. De Gea rushes out and clears. Ajax win the ball back and attack up the right again. Lukoki has a bit of a set-to with Fabio, claims he was fouled, gets nothing and United clear.  83 min: Ajax are camped outside the United penalty box again. United appear to have eased off a bit - but not so much that there&apos;s an obvious route forward for the home side. Still, United need to be careful.  83 min: Sulejmani eventually has a crack. He&apos;s just outside the area and on an angle, while his shot is not too powerful. De Gea saves comfortably.  GOAL! Ajax 0-2 Manchester United (Hernandez, 84 min): Valencia feeds Hernandez, who finds Rooney. The striker&apos;s in acres of space. He lifts his head and passes back to Hernandez who bobbles a shot under the keeper.  86 min: Valencia injured himself somehow during all of that. He walks straight off the pitch and straight down the touchline. Welbeck replaces him. Frank De Boer, in the dug-out, looks gloomy.  88 min: Rooney, again, has the whole of the left side of the pitch to himself. He trots towards the box, then curls a shot at the top corner. It&apos;s wide though.  88 min: &quot;David Wall [half time] has a point about the quality of Mourinho&apos;s football,&quot; writes Alex Hanton. &quot;But let&apos;s not disregard the possibility that people don&apos;t want Mourinho at their club because he&apos;s a bit of a tit. Yes Ferguson can be a bit unpleasant as well but he&apos;s been around for so long that we&apos;ve all started to be comforted by his presence. Its the same reason why people support the monarchy or Jarvis Cocker.&quot;  89 min: Aissati strides forward and tickles a long(ish) range teaser towards De Gea&apos;s left-hand post. The keeper gets down to turn the ball out for a corner, which comes to nothing.  90 min: Sulejmani takes advantage of a United slip, and heads towards goal. He attempts a chip, trying to loft the ball over De Gea. There&apos;s plenty of up on his shot, but not enough down. Three mins of extra time.  90 min + 1: &quot;Maybe Justin Kavannagh (73 min) needed one of these,&quot; emails Paul Tucker. &quot;It might make for a quicker game, but who&apos;s to say that&apos;s a bad thing?&quot;  Peep, peep: The game draws to a quiet close. A good result for United, that probably eases them into the next round, only another 3,000,000,000 games from the final.  Thanks for your emails: Right, no time for a considered round-up of the action because I&apos;m leaping straight over to here to bring you commentary from Porto v Manchester City.

Tom Cleverley was eased back against Ajax and even in a low-key return he showed why he has attracted more tributes than appearances for United. The first-leg meeting with Frank de Boer&apos;s pragmatic Ajax will not register in the annals at Old Trafford other than for the night Cleverely made his European debut for the club at the age of 22. For a United player of such promise it has been a long time coming, a reflection of the level Ferguson&apos;s teams had been operating at in Europe prior to this season but also the injury problems that have curtailed Cleverley&apos;s progress and saw him given only 60 minutes against the Dutch club. This was only the midfielder&apos;s eighth appearance in a United shirt in a season that was interrupted for six weeks after a foot injury sustained in a challenge with Kevin Davies at Bolton and then, two matches into his comeback, another four months after suffering ankle ligament damage at Everton. His previous seven outings had also resulted in a United victory, notably that 8-2 destruction of Arsenal and his display against Manchester City in the Community Shield when, for the undoubted promise on show, predictions of the new Scholes or the cheaper alternative to Wesley Sneijder always seemed a little premature. The game reflected the status of European football&apos;s long, winding and overblown second competition rather than that of the two opponents but there were occasional glimpses from Cleverely of the energy and accuracy he brings to the United midfield. A direct confrontation with Ajax&apos;s coveted young Dane, Christian Eriksen, a player linked with Old Trafford, offered the glimpse of a potential midfield of the future. That never materialised as caution consumed the two sides. Twice Cleverley demonstrated vision worthy of Scholes. In the first half he demanded a ball inside from Michael Carrick and instantly swept a superb pass for Wayne Rooney in space down the right. In the second, as Ajax cleared a United free-kick, he picked out Javier Hern\u00e1ndez inside a crowded penalty area with a precise volley. Both opportunities were squandered by United and it did not help Cleverley to find so many of his outlets \u2013 Nani, Hern\u00e1ndez and Ashley Young, irrespective of their goals \u2013 enduring nights when a good first touch was often beyond them. United&apos;s young players require European experience as the team&apos;s feeble exit from the Champions League in Basel, and the analysis from Roy Keane that so irked Ferguson, underlined. Injury absolved Cleverley from any culpability for the Champions League campaign and here he showed the pace and movement to support the United attack as Scholes once did but no one could in their absence in Switzerland. To the United manager, who recently salivated at the prospect of his midfield being improved by two players at opposite ends of the age scale, Cleverely&apos;s comeback is perfectly timed for the business end of the season and allows him an alternative to playing Scholes for 90 minutes, regardless of how exemplary those 90 minutes were against Liverpool on Saturday. &quot;It will be great to get the boy back because I think he&apos;s special,&quot; said Ferguson as Cleverley completed his latest rehabilitation. &quot;He will be desperate to play with Scholes. We have a great collection of midfield players.&quot; The master replaced the apprentice in Amsterdam and the expectation upon Cleverley is immense. As Eric Harrison, the former United youth coach synonymous with the best of the club&apos;s production line, said: &quot;Tom for me is, without question, so good that he is the best young player at United since Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham came on to the scene.&quot;", "sentences": ["We have a great collection of midfield players.&quot; The master replaced the apprentice in Amsterdam and the expectation upon Cleverley is immense."], "title": "Manchester United's Tom Cleverley gives glimpses of his special touch | Andy Hunter", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/feb/16/manchester-united-tom-cleverley", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Ajax", "Europa League 2011-12", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-16T22:00:00Z", "article": "The Guardian honoured Valentine&apos;s Day on Tuesday with a front page piece by Jeanette Winterson on love. It was a fine idea, given prominence over the euro, phone hacking and Syria. Winterson is a glorious writer and a delightful person. But why a woman? Why is it that only women can write of love? The stereotype holds that women do love and men do lager. Women are delicate and sensitive and men crude and unthinking. In Dickens and Trollope women are cardboard, in Austen and Eliot they are passionate and alive. To Winterson, men are mere suitors and wooers, while &quot;women have to do the love-work needed to make life more than a series of dates&quot;. The Guardian would no more have a man celebrate Valentine&apos;s Day than a woman celebrate cage fighting. Winterson&apos;s hymn to love was beautiful. She eulogised &quot;known love, new love, love&apos;s ghosts, love&apos;s hopes&quot;. A 60s nostalgic, she set love against money and power, and cited Haight-Ashbury and the anti-war movement. Love, she said, was not for weekends, flowers and chocolates, but rather an ecosystem, ever vulnerable to pollution. She wanted a National Love Day, transcending romance and sex with what appears to be a mass hug-in. She waxed so biblical I expected her to burst into 1 Corinthians 13: &quot;Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.&quot; This lurches perilously between pulpit platitude and Lennon and Ono&apos;s &quot;make love not war&quot;. The latter involved a week in bed in the Amsterdam Hilton, with acorns sent to world leaders. The couple planned bed-ins round the world until the bed in the Bahamas Sheraton proved too hot and sticky. Commentators deplored love being reduced to an existential abstraction, good for no one but hippies, theologians and narcissists. It was like Molesworth&apos;s Fotherington Thomas, &quot;who sa hullo clouds, hullo sky\u00a0and skip like a girlie&quot;. As abstraction it was ridiculous. I met Winterson at dinner this week and protested love&apos;s transitive nature. Its emotional force lay in there being another person, an object to the verb, a beloved. It could not be generalised across the world. Love demanded a strong definition. The great lady was surrounded by friends who looked at me\u00a0as might Jeremy Clarkson on seeing a cyclist eating quiche on Top Gear. How\u00a0dare a man speak thus in the presence of love&apos;s priestess? We hope, they cried, he won&apos;t do something disgusting like write about it. Jeanette, of course, was sweetness and light. She retorted that love begins intransitively, as a state of mind within us. It is a necessary prelude to fastening on a person. It is something that needs to be felt before moving to engagement, an attitude of mind, an outlook on the world. Hence her adoption of it to drive a social movement transcending conflicts and, presumably, personal relations. I remain unconvinced. Verbs without objects slither towards emptiness. We cannot feel compassion or sympathy without having someone to direct them at. We may be generous and tolerant in the abstract, but we cannot love in the abstract. Famous lovers of mankind, such as the Dalai Lama or Mother Theresa, are better seen as selfless, soothing or contemplative. The word love is easily reduced to triteness, yet it is so deep and explosive in its reference that it commands definitional respect. That is why the Greeks needed a range of words for love: agape, eros, philia and storge, roughly translated as affection, desire, companionship and parental bonding. Winterson has written so movingly of love&apos;s darkening hinterland, in loss, jealousy and pain, in betrayed friendships and parental love denied. She must know it is a concept not to be treated lightly or misapplied. Love is never all you need, any more than it is just for Valentine&apos;s Day. That said, I like the idea of occasionally seeking qualities that lift humanity above the rude mechanics of economics and society. Jan Morris is another writer tempted, like Winterson, to straighten the crooked timber of mankind. She fixed on kindness. In her masterpiece on Trieste, she wrote of a diaspora of the kind, &quot;sharing, across all nations, common values of humour and understanding. When you are among them you know you will not be mocked or resented, because they will not care about your race, your faith, your sex or your nationality. They suffer fools if not gladly, at least sympathetically. They laugh easily. They are easily grateful.&quot; Morris even toyed with founding a kindness party. Sitting on her balmy terrace in the Snowdonia, I remember slipping easily into her reverie of kindly bliss. We tried to draft a manifesto, until the chianti got the better of us. I\u00a0suggested a tolerance party, a fairness party, even a love party, \u00e0 la Winterson. I\u00a0settled on a courtesy party. I borrowed courtesy from the art historian, Kenneth Clark. When he asked himself what civilisation most required to go forward, he chose &quot;the rituals by which we avoid hurting other people&apos;s feelings by satisfying our own egos&quot;. He\u00a0wrote that it was through courtesy that society enabled individuals to be themselves and genius to flower. It required an accepted framework of behaving towards others, dignity in human relationships, customs and gestures of respect. Only thus would we avoid Yeats&apos;s hell, where &quot;passionate intensity&quot; was confined to the worst. I would reclaim love from abstraction and platitude, and marry it to courtesy. Then Winterson could be prime minister. \u2022 This article was corrected on 21 February 2012 because a subheading misspelled Jeanette Winterson&apos;s forename as Jeannette.

There was little grandeur for them to savour in this Europa League encounter. While pondering the last 32 of a lesser tournament, they would have felt a pang this week as the knockout phase of the Champions League got under way without them. Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s team were professional enough to ensure that the return leg with Ajax will not be a distraction as they strive primarily to retain the Premier League title. Even so, action in Europe is not to be taken lightly. United must have been mortified by their elimination from the Champions League, following the defeat by Basel in Switzerland. Any follower of the club might have wondered if Ajax would pose a comparable challenge. They could not do so and, while the general level of technique was sound, there was no threat. United should still not be denied credit for their professionalism. The knowhow in United&apos;s ranks counts for a great deal. They were patient, although it took until the second half before Ashley Young opened the scoring. The second goal, forced home by Javier Hern\u00e1ndez after he had been picked out by Rooney, did not come until the 85th minute. Summoning up the intensity that Ferguson expected was not easy to achieve. It was peculiar, for instance, that Rio Ferdinand, the captain, should duck and leave his goalkeeper David de Gea to thrust away a firm drive from Siem de Jong in the 32nd minute. Ferguson did inject enterprise that, for the most part, pinned down Ajax. His troupe had figures to catch the eye. This was Tom Cleverley&apos;s return to the first team after injuring an ankle at Everton on 29 October. Cleverley will benefit from the hour he had on the field, although his inclusion was a further sign that Ferguson did not live in dread of Ajax. Hern\u00e1ndez, often a substitute, started beside Rooney in attack, with each anticipating crosses from the wingers Nani and Young. The lineup as a whole was full of enterprise. When it came to promoting the secondary tournament, United had done Uefa proud by treating it with much of the gravity that would apply in the Champions\u00a0League. This was a game that would have intrigued the two clubs as much as it irritated them. Given the grand history that distinguishes Ajax and United, it smacked of a towering encounter, yet there was no escaping the truth that both had done no more than come third in their respective Champions League groups. Even so, it would be rash to claim that each is in decline. United are in hot pursuit of Manchester City at the head of the Premier League and a far less effective Ajax have still had hints of encouragement. Real Madrid may have run amok in their group but the Dutch side were edged out of second place on goal difference by Lyon only because the La Liga team, compiled at preposterous expense, completed the fixtures with a merciless 4-0 win in Amsterdam. Ajax, with Frank de Boer and his assistant Dennis Bergkamp in command, have concerns of greater moment than this European tie since the club lie sixth in the Eredivisie, eight points behind the leaders, PSV Eindhoven. Nonetheless the encounter with United was an occasion in its own right that could release Ajax from the grind of the domestic programme. The way in which they took to the meeting with United compelled the visitors to search for more sharpness after the interval. Ferguson would have aired some grievances in the dressing room. The tempo quickened and, even more pertinently, there was an enhanced intent to the work as Ajax were confined to their penalty area and its surrounds for much of the time. Belatedly the character of the match altered as the hosts were pinned down. Clustered around their own goalmouth, Ajax were running a risk that they were unlikely to survive. With 59 minutes gone Nani&apos;s cross from the right broke off the captain, Jan Vertonghen, and Young, coming off the other flank and into the centre of the penalty area, slotted a finish into the net. In truth United were generally circumspect and willing to let Ajax roll passes in front of them. That may have shown a respect for the opposition and the tournament, yet they would seldom be so sedate against Premier League opponents of greater means. Ferguson and his men at least have their victory as they wonder just what to make of the European competition in which they find themselves.", "sentences": ["Real Madrid may have run amok in their group but the Dutch side were edged out of second place on goal difference by Lyon only because the La Liga team, compiled at preposterous expense, completed the fixtures with a merciless 4-0 win in Amsterdam."], "title": "Ajax 0-2 Manchester United | Europa League last-32 match report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/16/ajax-manchester-united-europa-league", "tags": ["Europa League 2011-12", "Ajax", "Manchester United", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-17T22:55:05Z", "article": "Tom-All-Alone&apos;s by Lynn Shepherd (Corsair, \u00a312.99)Unlike the Jane Austen cottage industry of sequels and prequels, there have been relatively few forays into Dickens &quot;fan fiction&quot;. Shepherd&apos;s book is an admirable example, using characters and situations from Bleak House combined with a cast of her own devising and a few nods to Wilkie Collins&apos;s The Woman in White along the way. She manages to rise above the problems inherent in appropriating someone else&apos;s creations \u2013 everyone behaves in character \u2013 and, if she can&apos;t quite match Dickens&apos;s magnificent grotesquery, she doesn&apos;t have his emetic sentimentality either. A necessary eye for squalor, meticulous research and deft plotting, as well as the ability to handle the difficult God&apos;s-eye-view narration with aplomb make this a book which, unless you are completely Dickensed-out by this stage in the bicentenary proceedings, you&apos;ll be guaranteed to enjoy. The Golden Scales by Parker Bilal (Bloomsbury, \u00a311.99)Parker Bilal is the nom-de-crime of literary novelist Jamal Mahjoub, and this is the first book in a series set in Cairo and featuring private detective Makana. A former police officer and refugee from Sudan who lives on a ramshackle Nile houseboat, Makana is well placed to view the complexities of Egypt&apos;s changing political situation; Bilal&apos;s powers of description and his sensible, wryly compassionate leading man make this an enthralling read. Commissioned by the owner of a football team to find his vanished star player, Makana encounters Liz Markham, still searching for the daughter who disappeared 17 years ago, and attempts to help her. When Liz is found murdered, he decides that the two investigations are connected. To do this, he navigates his way through a fascinating, mysterious place where desperate poverty sits cheek-by-jowl with immense wealth, and where chaos, corruption, Russian gangsters and Muslim extremists abound. A Dark Redemption by Stav Sherez (Faber, \u00a312.99)After novels set in Amsterdam and Greece, Sherez returns home for a police procedural. The gritty London setting, DI Jack Carrigan the maverick cop, and DS Geneva Miller the sidekick who&apos;s been tasked with spying on him for their mutual boss are all, on the face of it, pretty standard fare. However, the powerful flashbacks set in Uganda, where, as callow postgraduates, Carrigan and his friends were caught up in the atrocities perpetrated by the deranged members of the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army, promise something quite different, and Sherez doesn&apos;t disappoint. The past trauma resurfaces when the murder of a Ugandan girl takes the duo into the unseen world of the illegal immigrant. Fast paced and slick, this is the first in what could well be an outstanding series. The Fall by Claire McGowan (Headline, \u00a312.99)McGowan&apos;s first novel is a perceptive examination of the after-effects of murder. Privileged, na\u00efve Charlotte is obsessed with her imminent wedding, but her world falls apart when a coke-fuelled evening slumming it in a London club goes disastrously wrong and her banker fianc\u00e9 Dan finds himself awaiting trial for murder. Subsequent events bring her into contact with Keisha, a mixed-race girl with a useless boyfriend and a child in care, and DC Matthew Hegarty who, after the pleasure of a successful collar has worn off, finds himself having second thoughts and falling for Charlotte. The characters are finely drawn, and it&apos;s concern for them, rather than for whodunnit, that provides the page-turning impetus in this promising debut. \u2022 Laura Wilson&apos;s A Capital Crime is published by Quercus.", "sentences": ["A Dark Redemption by Stav Sherez (Faber, \u00a312.99)After novels set in Amsterdam and Greece, Sherez returns home for a police procedural."], "title": "Crime roundup \u2013 reviews", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/17/crime-fiction-roundup-reviews", "tags": ["Crime fiction", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-17T22:55:17Z", "article": "For 40 years, EM Forster and the policeman Bob Buckingham were in a loving relationship. Buckingham was 28, Forster 51, when the two met. They shared holidays, friends, interests, and \u2013 on many weekends \u2013 a domestic and sexual life in Forster&apos;s Brunswick Square flat. But this was a relationship in which there were three people. In his memoir My Father and Myself, Forster&apos;s great friend JR\u00a0Ackerley wrote that the problem of the girlfriend was &quot;all too liable to be found in the lives of normal boys \u2026 Since women could not be excluded they had to be admitted ... the Ideal Friend could have a girl or wife if he wished, so long as she did not interfere with me. No wife ever failed to interfere with me.&quot; The same was true for Forster, but the wife who &quot;interfered&quot; in his life \u2013 Buckingham&apos;s wife, May \u2013 also became his friend and nursemaid. Perhaps this is not so surprising for the writer who valued personal relationships above all else, and for whom the motto &quot;only connect&quot; applied as much to his private life as to his novels. Who else but Forster could end up becoming firm friends with his lover&apos;s wife, and godparent to her child? It&apos;s easy to see why Buckingham&apos;s vigour and toughness were attractive qualities for Forster. As a child, he was cast in the role of the &quot;delicate&quot; boy, always wrapped up and fussed over by his mother Lily, and always with half an eye on the farm boys next door. At Tonbridge Prep School, where the motto was &quot;Perish every laggard, and let us all be men&quot;, Forster was, predictably, badly bullied. Even at Cambridge, where he discovered real camaraderie and love between men, Lytton Strachey christened him &quot;the Taupe&quot;. A &quot;real&quot; man, bluff, beefy and beautiful, was evidently irresistible to this mole, both as lover and protector. His relationship with Buckingham was not his first with a policeman: he&apos;d already enjoyed a brief dalliance with Harry Daley, who was, for the Bloomsbury set of the 1920s and 30s, something of a celebrity young tough. Daley regularly entertained Ackerley, Duncan Grant and Forster at the Hammersmith Section House, treating them to bacon and eggs and boxing matches. Forster also had a fling with a bus driver named Arthur, which ended after Arthur&apos;s wife kicked up a stink. Forster wrote to Ackerley: &quot;It is not my policy, even were it within my power, to break up homes.&quot; Of the affair, he noted in his diary: &quot;Coarseness and tenderness have kissed one another, but imaginative passion, love, doesn&apos;t exist with the lower classes.&quot; So when the novelist met Buckingham at a party given by Ackerley on the day of the 1930 Oxford v Cambridge boat race, he already had his ideal of the working-class boy firmly in place. Influenced by Edward Carpenter&apos;s ideas, he&apos;d long fantasised about living in a rural idyll &quot;looked after by the robust and grateful lower classes&quot;. It was a fantasy in which he, as an educated, moneyed novelist, had the upper hand. But his relationship with Buckingham was to challenge his assumptions in more ways than one. Buckingham was a large, good-humoured man, with a nose flattened in the boxing ring, a wide smile and a deep, loud laugh. On the day they met, he impressed Forster with his knowledge of the Thames and told him he was reading Dostoevsky. Forster invited Buckingham to his flat, and soon the two became close, with Forster taking over Buckingham&apos;s reading list, and Buckingham thrilled to become something of a highbrow. Soon Forster was in a position to write of Buckingham&apos;s falling &quot;violently in liking&quot; with him. To his friend Sebastian Sprott, Forster wrote with rather old-maidish coyness that the &quot;spiritual feeling&quot; between him and Buckingham had now &quot;extended to my physique&quot;. During these early years of their relationship, Forster seems to have at last found happiness. In his Commonplace Book, he reported that &quot;From 51 to 53 I have been happy, and would like to remind others that their turn can come too.&quot; This was in spite of Buckingham finding a girlfriend \u2013 May Hockey, a nurse \u2013 not long after he&apos;d met Forster. In 1932 Buckingham announced that he was to marry May; the register-office wedding took place in August, with Forster as witness. Once Buckingham was married, Forster&apos;s worst fears seemed to come true \u2013 Buckingham became rather unreliable about their meetings, and Forster panicked, calling his rival &quot;domineering, sly and knowing&quot; and wondering if he should break with his lover and go abroad to escape the situation. Buckingham, ever the voice of calm sense, wrote that the two of them simply had &quot;to go without pleasure for a bit&quot;. By December, Forster was visiting the Buckinghams at their flat in Shepherd&apos;s Bush, and becoming more involved in their life as a couple; this was the beginning of the triangular arrangement, which, like Forster&apos;s work, was at once quietly domestic and rather revolutionary. While living with May, Buckingham pledged his half days off, and other hours during the week, to Forster. May, although jealous and often difficult, refused to listen when Harry Daley warned her that Forster was about to break up her marriage. Perhaps she, like Buckingham, stood to gain from what Forster could offer: not only money (he often gave financial gifts), but also entrance into the life of the cultural elite. If this was not lost on Buckingham, it was actively appreciated by May, who later wrote of Forster, &quot;To him I owe a great debt of gratitude. For his widening of horizons, by meeting his friends, but mostly by his talk.&quot; In April 1933, Buckingham and May had a baby boy whom they named Robin Morgan; Forster was godfather. It took a serious illness, however, to really change his and May&apos;s relationship. In 1935, she became ill with TB and was sent to a sanatorium for a year. Forster made a kind of deal with her, no doubt thinking, initially at least, of his own needs. If she sent Robin to her sister, he would watch over Buckingham and report back to her regularly. He got what he wanted, and promptly took Buckingham off to Amsterdam, where they stayed with Isherwood and his lover Heinz. But it was through writing that Forster became close to May. Over the next year, he wrote to her often, sending her assurances that Buckingham and Robin were well, along with small gifts. He insisted that she and her family should be alone together for a while when she came home. Remarkably, their relationship improved \u2013 perhaps Forster could reveal his best to May through the written word; perhaps, as Wendy Moffat suggests in her biography, Forster, by writing to her, imagined May as a fictional character, and thus came to love her. During this time, he referred to her as a &quot;very decent sort&quot; and a &quot;friend in her own right&quot;. After May recovered, a functioning triangular arrangement was firmly established, with the two of them sharing their beloved Buckingham; the long weekends were for May, the short ones for Forster. Such an arrangement may only have worked in conditions of complete silence about the true nature of Forster&apos;s relationship with Buckingham; but it did, at least, work. Forster&apos;s mother also began a friendship with May. Forster wrote to Buckingham: &quot;Although my mother has been intermittently tiresome for the last 30 years, cramped and warped my genius, hindered my career, blocked and buggered up my house, and boycotted my beloved, I have to admit she has provided a sort of rich subsoil where I have been able to rest and grow. That, rather than sex or wifiness, seems to be women&apos;s special gift to men.&quot; Possibly this is how he came to think of May too, particularly after Lily died in 1945. Indeed, May wrote that &quot;when his mother died \u2026 I feel that in some ways I took her place.&quot; The years immediately following Lily&apos;s death were terrible for Forster; not only did he suffer intense grief, he also became worried that Buckingham was no longer interested in him. But by 1949 the two men were on good terms again and they visited New York together, where they were photographed by George Platt Lynes. The photographs are remarkable: Forster looks every inch the eminent writer, Buckingham looks handsome and relaxed. In one, a domestic portrait of the pair, they gaze directly at one another with great humour and warmth, Buckingham shining down on Forster. For two men not publicly &quot;out&quot; in any way, it is an extraordinarily revealing pose. During his later years, May was often nursemaid to Forster. In the mid-1960s he suffered a series of strokes, and it was this which broke the silence. It seems his tongue was loosened in his weakened state, and he spoke to Buckingham frankly about his physical passion for him. A shocked Buckingham claimed to May that he&apos;d known nothing of Forster&apos;s sexuality. He then began to behave strangely towards his lover, growing irritable and distant. It was May who reminded Buckingham that Forster was their friend and benefactor (he&apos;d recently given them \u00a310,000) and should be in their home; when Forster suffered a second stroke, she insisted on nursing\u00a0him. In these last years, May confided in Forster about her grief over the early death of Robin, who&apos;d succumbed to Hodgkin&apos;s disease in 1962. These two people, novelist and nurse, lover and wife, comforted one another and their relationship became rather like that of a mother and her grown-up son: to Forster&apos;s biographer PN Furbank, May remembered Forster as a bad patient, getting under her feet and insisting on engaging her in conversation when all she wanted was to get on with the housework. It was this anecdote, more than anything else, which inspired me to investigate the story of this fascinating triangle and use it as the inspiration for my new novel, My Policeman. Following his final stroke in May 1970, Forster was fetched from his rooms at King&apos;s College by the Buckinghams and put to bed at their Coventry house, where he died. For most of that morning, he held May&apos;s hand. After his death, May wrote: &quot;I now know that he was in love with Robert and therefore critical and jealous of me and our early years were very stormy, mostly because he had not the faintest idea of the pattern of our lives and was determined that Robert should not be engulfed in domesticity. Over the years he changed us both and he and I came to love one another, able to share the joys and sorrows that came.&quot; Nowhere was the talent that Forster had for approaching things slightly askew, for bringing together the things we expect to be opposite \u2013 personal and political, conventional and unconventional, friend and rival \u2013 more evident than in his relationship with Bob and May Buckingham. Theirs was, to use a Forsterian term, a quite wonderful muddle.", "sentences": ["He got what he wanted, and promptly took Buckingham off to Amsterdam, where they stayed with Isherwood and his lover Heinz."], "title": "EM Forster and his 'wondrous muddle'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/17/e-m-forster-my-policeman", "tags": ["EM Forster", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-19T14:06:53Z", "article": "In the 1970s, when he had fallen out of fashion, the great American singer Roy Orbison played Chorlton-cum-Hardy, and I went to see him at one of those chicken-in-the-basket places called Quaffers or Shaggers or something.

The sticky carpet, the careworn banquettes, the cigarette-scarred tables \u2013 this is Shaggers, not the Amsterdam Arena \u2013 all seemed unworthy of one of the greatest voices in pop, and so did Europe&apos;s contractual obligation competition for two of the continent&apos;s iconic clubs. &quot;Thursday night, Channel 5,&quot; is what fans like to sneer at those who have failed to qualify or, like United, stumbled out early in the Champions League, so it was as well Jim Rosenthal was around on Thursday to put a brave face on it. There is no face better. Through all the turmoil at ITV as Bob Wilson, Sir Des, Steve Rider and Chiles all scrapped for the presenter&apos;s chair, Jim&apos;s brave face was always available. Now Richard Desmond&apos;s cheap-as-chips TV outlet, where you are never too far away from a variation on the CSI theme, or a Hollywood film starring no one you have ever heard of, has invested in Jim&apos;s never dimming smile to put a gloss on what some of us like to call the European losers&apos; cup. Just as United have brought back Scholes, so Channel 5 has the wisdom, experience, and comforting presence of Jim on those troublesome Thursday nights. &quot;There are big names in football, then there are giants,&quot; was his stirring intro to United v Ajax. &quot;Good teams win trophies, great teams win trebles. Many will have their moment in history but few will dominate whole eras. Great players live long in the memory but legends claim their right to immortality. Ajax and Manchester United are special.&quot; Great sell, Jim, except this is Manchester United 2012, not the best vintage, against an Ajax club being torn apart in the kind of internecine struggle so many Dutch international squads have entertained us with over the years. A 2-0 win for United was pretty average rather than Pretty Woman, with even Sir Alex calling it &quot;a very ordinary performance&quot;. He couldn&apos;t wipe the smile off Jim&apos;s face, though. &quot;See, Thursday nights, Channel 5, not that bad,&quot; was his sign-off. Fair dos, no worse than any other night. The Olympics could use some of Jim&apos;s relentless positivity right now. A Dispatches investigation on Channel 4 into the ticketing scandal that means the rich and privileged elbow out ordinary people \u2013 such as, for instance, the parents of competitors \u2014 from the big events, was one-eyed, unbalanced, and absolutely spot on. What is often forgotten about the Olympics is that it was at Berlin in 1936 that the idea of the fortnight as a national PR exercise was first established. All sorts of business, orchestrated by Richard Strauss and filmed by Leni Riefenstahl, was introduced to promote Germany. The Olympic torch relay, for instance; that was one of Hitler&apos;s. Is it too facile to say it started with goose pimples and ended in goose steps? Well, yes, but the Nazis used every tool in their propaganda armoury to present Berlin and Germany in a positive light to the rest of the world. Anti-Jewish signs were taken down for the games, and newspapers toned down their rhetoric, in order to promote an image of a peaceful, tolerant Germany. We are already a relatively peaceful, tolerant nation, so the lie we are propagating is that it is possible to drive across London without getting caught in congestion. We are doing this by taking a lane away from all routes to use as Olympic lanes, open not just to the athletes, but to media, officials, VIPs and, Dispatches alleged, to people rich enough to pay ticketing agents tens of thousands of pounds for Olympic packages. London cabbies are furious (they&apos;re always furious, I know, but in this case with some justification). Jonathan Myers, of the United Cabbies&apos; Group, said: &quot;When you&apos;re sitting in a queue, and VIPs sweep past you from their plush hotels in the West End in their chauffeur driven BMWs, that is not the right message of the Olympics.&quot; The chauffeurs, by the way, will be required to wear caps. Dispatches got hold of what in rock &apos;n&apos; roll would be called artistes special requirements, every one of which Seb Coe and the bid team meekly complied with, including a demand that the IOC&apos;s top brass \u2013 Sepp Blatter and his mates \u2013 should at no time from the air-conditioned luxury of their vehicles have the indignity of gazing upon the back of a cabby&apos;s bare head. These charming folk also insisted on five-star hotels with free swimming pools, free saunas and free room service (no word on trouser presses but go ahead, eat the two quid Toblerone, we&apos;ll pick up the tab). That is just some of what we are getting for our \u00a39bn. The Blatterati have also demanded they meet the Queen the day before the opening, when she will no doubt be expected to genuflect.

The\u00a0midfielder hopes a return to consistent action will help gain him selection for the England squad at this summer&apos;s European Championships. Sir Alex Ferguson, whose side defeated Ajax 2-0 in the opening leg at the Amsterdam Arena, said on Wednesday: &quot;Rooney&apos;s out. He&apos;s had a really bad throat. There were traces of it last week in Amsterdam but we gave him medication. But it&apos;s got worse, he&apos;s been in bed over the weekend. He came in today for the first time and we&apos;re trying to get him in side for Sunday [at Norwich City].&quot; Of Cleverley, who played 60 minutes against Ajax before being replaced by Paul Scholes, the manager said: &quot;He is a very clever footballer. He has got a quick brain in terms of appreciation of passing. An hour last week was fantastic for him, that was just enough for him. Hopefully he will play a full game tomorrow. He gives us more ammunition in the midfield area, which a few months ago everyone was starting to worry about. &quot;But with Scholes, [Ryan] Giggs and [Michael] Carrick, whose form has been fantastic, and Anderson now back in training with the first time we have some good options now.&quot; Of Cleverley&apos;s England prospects Ferguson added: &quot;I think before his injury he was involved anyway \u2013 along with [Chris] Smalling, [Phil] Jones and [Danny] Welbeck. There&apos;s indications there that he is in the frame anyway.&quot; If Giggs plays against Ajax it will be his 900th appearance for the club and Cleverley, born just two years before the Welshman made his debut, struggled to recall his first memory of the Welshman. &quot;I can&apos;t remember exactly but I remember pretending to be him in the back garden and things like that. Him and Scholsey are good for us younger players to have around and learn from,&quot; he said. While Ferguson stated that he does not think the poor showing of English clubs in this season&apos;s Champions League suggests a long-term slide, Michael Owen is back running following a thigh injury and should &quot;be joining us in two weeks time&quot;. United&apos;s potential title decider with Manchester City on Saturday 28 April will now be played at 8pm on the following Monday, with both clubs possibly asking for extra rest days to due to potential Europa League commitments ahead of the previous date.

Being in [Manchester City&apos;s] Premier League 25 [-man squad], I think everyone expected him to apologise. There was no way they were going to put him in the 25 unless he apologised so that was always going to be on the cards.

An inability to protect a lead and complacency at Old Trafford contributed to their demise in the Champions League. Both made an untimely reappearance as Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s team advanced in defeat and with nerves frayed against Ajax. United&apos;s performance against Frank de Boer&apos;s ultimately vibrant side was everything Ferguson had cautioned against before kick-off and Toby Alderweireld&apos;s 87th-minute goal raised the spectre of a second early European exit of the season. Not that warnings should have been necessary following the costly Champions League draws at home to Benfica and Basel in the group phase. Phil Jones, one of four members of Stuart Pearce&apos;s England squad for Wednesday&apos;s Holland friendly to start the game under the watchful eye of the caretaker manager and Harry Redknapp, admitted that &quot;a little bit of complacency crept in and it cost us&quot;. Unlike in the aftermath of Basel and Benfica, however, Ferguson absolved his players of blame for another home performance that exposed the squad&apos;s European inexperience. He took full responsibility for a team selection that almost backfired embarrassingly. &quot;It was nervy,&quot; the United manager said. &quot;I&apos;ve got to accept the responsibility tonight myself \u2013 playing so many young players in the back four position was a big ask. It was a good opportunity to give Jones and [Chris] Smalling a game. But their lack of experience at pushing up and tightening up a game showed. For a European game it was too much of a risk. We survived it with a bit of luck.&quot; Ajax lacked conviction in Amsterdam last week yet Ferguson had claimed that United could not consider the job done, even with a two-goal cushion and a clean sheet from the first leg. He gambled, however, on fielding a team with an average age of 24 and a defence with an average age of 21. United set about ending the contest with haste and Nani had tested the goalkeeper Kenneth Vermeer before Javier Hern\u00e1ndez extended their aggregate lead to three. Jan Vertonghen, the Ajax captain and centre-half, cost his team with a careless pass that United&apos;s captain for the night, Park Ji-sung, intercepted in midfield. The ball broke for Dimitar Berbatov, who swept a fine pass into Hern\u00e1ndez, and the Mexico international stepped inside Alderweireld to confirm his returning confidence with a fourth goal in his past four appearances. An Ajax support strong in number and in song was silenced. They won few friends with chants for Luis Su\u00e1rez, the club&apos;s former striker. United had opportunities to stretch their lead but Rafael da Silva was fortunate his booking for a lunge on Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro was not his second of the night after a ludicrous dive inside the Ajax area went unpunished. Once the visitors had settled, however, it was Rafael&apos;s twin brother, F\u00e1bio, who had the greater problems as Aras Ozbiliz flourished on the right wing and Siem de Jong took the game to United from central midfield. &quot;I had a feeling we could get a great result before the game,&quot; said De Boer. &quot;But we were insecure in our passing in the first half, even with simple passes like the first goal, and even at 3-0 [in the tie] I felt we could threaten United if we performed as we are capable of doing. I am disappointed. The team could have done much more.&quot; The impressive Ozbiliz brought Ajax level with an emphatic finish into the bottom corner of David de Gea&apos;s goal from 20 yards, albeit after Lodeiro had escaped with a handball in the buildup. Ajax dominated possession from the half hour onwards and it was not until the introduction of Paul Scholes, Jonny Evans and Danny Welbeck that United displayed the strength and composure in midfield, plus the pace in attack, to regain a modicum of control. But they were far from home comfortably. Nani struck the bar on the counterattack and De Gea produced a fine reflex save from De Jong&apos;s near-post header as Ajax mounted late pressure. It finally told when the central defender Alderweireld powered home a header from Ozbiliz&apos;s free-kick at the back post. &quot;The next game is at home against [Athletic] Bilbao and you will see the experienced players back for that,&quot; said Ferguson.", "sentences": ["We survived it with a bit of luck.&quot; Ajax lacked conviction in Amsterdam last week yet Ferguson had claimed that United could not consider the job done, even with a two-goal cushion and a clean sheet from the first leg."], "title": "Manchester United 1-2 Ajax | Europa League match report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/23/manchester-united-ajax-europa-league", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Ajax", "Europa League 2011-12", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-24T14:34:56Z", "article": "North The Fuel season continues at the Unity in Liverpool with Sound&amp;Fury&apos;s Going Dark until tomorrow followed by Univited Guests&apos; Make Better Please.

As Europeans we should start looking at our cultural sector as a reservoir of hope, ideas and new economic growth that can lead us out of the crisis. The Europe of tomorrow is only going to be as successful and liveable as the ideas we have to make it grow. We all need master what artists are already good at \u2013 making more with less, finding fresh new perspectives and exciting new combinations. Art is not only a pleasurable icing on the cake; it is also a way of thinking and a practice of working innovatively with reality that can inspire us all to do better. Furthermore, while the crisis is economic and political, it certainly isn&apos;t cultural. European cities are right now among the most creative and vibrant in the world. Cities like London, Milan, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Copenhagen are not only major metropolises but also major creative centres with hundreds of thousands employed in the creative industries. By including culture on a much broader level in city planning, social policy and business development, we can create much more economically sustainable, attractive and liveable cities. In Copenhagen, a recent survey by the Danish thinktank Fora shows that the creative industry is the city&apos;s most important, with about 70,000 employed either directly in creative job positions or in businesses like fashion retail that benefit from the innovations of the creative industry. In 2008, 21% of Denmark&apos;s new startups focused on creative value creation. In the European Union the creative industry accounts for at least 3.3 pct of the economy \u2013 up to 4.5% based on measurement methods. Employment in the creative industry also grows more rapidly than in other industries: 3.5% a year compared with a 1% growth in employment as a whole. The European commission&apos;s proposal for a new support programme - Creative Europe \u2013 precisely aims at supporting artists and professionals in the creative sectors across Europe. We encourage all politicians to work for initiatives that can get art out of its silos and make art, creation and cultural activity part of society at large. There are really two tasks here: on the one hand, we have to encourage society to learn from the artists and creative innovators, and on the other we should make it easier for artists to learn from entrepreneurial practices in spreading their work and ideas. We have to create real, lasting relationships between the artistic community, the creative industries and other sectors like education, business, production and research, but also our foreign policy and development work. There is a lot to gain simply by stimulating new relationships, and this strategy can create immense growth without a need for big financial investments. For their part, the artists and creative innovators need to realise their own potential and take back their authority. They need to once again step into the arena as the central players in society&apos;s own story about itself. We politicians need to be better at listening to the artists and learn their language, but they also have to be a lot better at reaching out to the rest of society. We are not trying to coax the artists into sacrificing artistic integrity on the altar of growth. On the contrary, we need them to do exactly what they are already doing \u2013 as artists, they are uniquely qualified to look at the chaos of the world and create a sense of perspective and hope. While we all have to accept the crisis as it is, we have to see what it also can be: a great opportunity to realign our European community and reinvent ourselves in a new and better way. We have already seen how young artists played a major role in the Arab spring. The next generation of European artists has both a great responsibility and a major opportunity \u2013 they should accept it and be courageous. To paraphrase Hillary Clinton: &quot;Never waste a crisis \u2013 even if it is not a good one.&quot; \u2022 On 27-28 February the Danish minister for culture will launch a European taskforce called Team Culture 2012. Twelve creative thinkers and thinking creators will draft a manifesto on the role of art and culture in a time of crisis and then journey into Europe to find dynamic cultural examples that will be presented at a conference in June. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "sentences": ["Cities like London, Milan, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Copenhagen are not only major metropolises but also major creative centres with hundreds of thousands employed in the creative industries."], "title": "Europe's artists can make sense of the chaos and create hope | Uffe Elb\u00e6k and Androulla Vassiliou", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/25/europe-artists-chaos-hope", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Culture", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-28T17:00:01Z", "article": "Stuart Pearce can be forgiven for harking back to Euro 96 when he announced his squad for the visit of Holland to Wembley on Wednesday. The 4-1 victory in that tournament was, he said, &quot;as good a performance as I&apos;ve ever been involved in&quot;, before optimistically adding: &quot;That kind of performance would help the whole country.&quot; England&apos;s verve that night, with Steve McManaman subtly prompting in a wandering brief, was exemplified by Teddy Sheringham&apos;s cute dummy, shimmy and pass to Alan Shearer who smashed his shot past Edwin van der Sar to make it 3-0. For a while it seemed that the years of incoherence and frustration had been banished by the enlightened tactical approach of Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle but only four years later England were once more as muddled and fragile as they had been for the majority of the preceding three decades. It was a rare moment of rapture against the Dutch, a team England have struggled to master since the game went professional in the Netherlands in 1954. It has often proved a chastening experience for the team and their manager. Even in 1970, Holland&apos;s first match at Wembley, neither England&apos;s status as world champions nor gratitude for Sir Alf Ramsey could stop the choruses of &quot;what a load of rubbish&quot; and bouts of slow hand-clapping castigating an experimental team&apos;s failure to pierce the opposition&apos;s defence during a goalless draw. The old refrain rang out again seven years later, when Don Revie&apos;s England were humiliatingly outclassed at Wembley. The magnificent Dutch forward line of Johnny Rep, Johan Cruyff and Robbie Rensenbrink mesmerised England&apos;s defenders with their intelligent use of space and the 2-0 scoreline flattered the bedraggled home side. The scorer of both goals, AZ&apos;s Jan Peters, was known as &quot;Jantje Breed&quot;, &quot;little Jan wide&quot; in mockery at his preference for short, square passes which allayed risk, but his inhibitions did not prevent him getting into the box to finish moves orchestrated by Cruyff and put the ball past Ray Clemence twice in eight minutes. England were so inferior that our own David Lacey suggested &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot; would have been a more appropriate song for the disgruntled supporters to sing. Not for the last time when England&apos;s inadequacies have been exposed by the Dutch, international careers were terminated after defeat and Dave Clement, Mike Doyle, Paul Madeley and Stan Bowles never won another cap. I was in the crowd at Wembley in March 1988 when England played Holland three months before they were due to meet in D\u00fcsseldorf at Euro 88 and the thing I remember most during a half-hour spell of Dutch dominance was the silence. England emerged with a deceptive 2-2 draw but such was Ruud Gullit&apos;s control of the game, making repeated menacing runs from a withdrawn midfield role like a marauding Gulliver among Lilliputians and slotting numerous passes behind England&apos;s square back four, that the sense of foreboding was palpable. He created havoc with his intelligent, crisp passes and kept popping up in the wide gap between Tony Adams and Neil Webb like some malevolent whack-a-mole. Had the England players been armed with mallets, they still would not have landed a blow. Anyone who saw that game would not have been surprised when Gullit set up two of Marco van Basten&apos;s three goals in the 3-1 victory in Germany, only that he did not score himself. England played better than they had against the Republic of Ireland and fought back determinedly to equalise through Bryan Robson&apos;s typically indomitable surge but Gary Lineker, suffering from glandular fever, could not match Van Basten&apos;s predatory poise. A game later Hoddle, then only 30, and Kenny Sansom, 29, were jettisoned. It was with the threat posed by Gullit specifically in mind that England finally abandoned the flat back four when the two met at Italia 90, opting for two markers and a very English style of libero, and together they largely kept him in check in a goalless draw. Orthodoxy returned under Graham Taylor and England paid the price in a 2-2 draw at Wembley during 1993 for Des Walker&apos;s loss of confidence following his transfer to Sampdoria. Taylor can justifiably claim he was abandoned by luck in Rotterdam during the return-game qualifier for the 1994 World Cup and he was understandably peeved when the referee failed to send Ronald Koeman off. &quot;Linesman? Linesman?&quot; he famously asked. &quot;What sort of thing is happening here?&quot; But Holland could also have demanded to know why Frank Rijkaard&apos;s first-half &quot;goal&quot; was disallowed when he was a yard onside. England failed entirely to nullify Dennis Bergkamp, who ran at will at retreating midfielders and when Brian Moore&apos;s premonition of what Koeman would do from his retaken free-kick agonisingly came to pass, it delivered the coup de gr\u00e2ce to Taylor&apos;s three years in charge. It was the end too for Carlton Palmer, Tony Dorigo and Lee Sharpe, who never played for England again. Friendlies, too, have turned out to be fatal. After the 1-1 draw in Amsterdam in 2002, out went Michael Ricketts, whose international days lasted barely the blink of an eye, Chris Powell and Kevin Phillips. No wonder Pearce treasures that balmy June evening in 1996 so fondly. We all do. The lesson, however, when Holland play England, is that danger is often lurking.", "sentences": ["After the 1-1 draw in Amsterdam in 2002, out went Michael Ricketts, whose international days lasted barely the blink of an eye, Chris Powell and Kevin Phillips."], "title": "England have made an art of failing to master the footballing Dutch", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/feb/28/england-holland", "tags": ["England", "Holland", "Stuart Pearce", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-02-28T17:37:55Z", "article": "Two years on from losing a World Cup final to Spain in which Holland mutated from total football to total carnage, Bert van Marwijk&apos;s squad sweep into Wembley for Wednesday&apos;s friendly against England with the Oranje philosophy restored. Qualification for Euro 2012 featured nine consecutive wins and was booked as early as September, with Wesley Sneijder, Robin van Persie, Rafael van der Vaart and Arjen Robben re-acquainting themselves with the heritage of Johan Cruyff and Marco van Basten, the stars of the gilded Holland sides of the 1970s and 80s. That X-rated display in Johannesburg against Spain was headed by Nigel de Jong&apos;s kung-fu kick on Xabi Alonso \u2013 studs first, causing the midfielder a broken rib \u2013 ably supported by Marc van Bommel, and is explained thus by Van der Vaart: &quot;The problem is, when you play against Spain or Barcelona, you are running behind the ball and it&apos;s frustrating and it looks like you&apos;re not running, but you&apos;ve given everything. They just tac-tac-tac-tac and they are gone again. So a few tackles were too hard and too late, which is not good because it is not our game. But when you reach the final you want to win no matter what.&quot; How England would love the conundrum of trying to win a major tournament showpiece. Instead they start their Euro 2012 preparations in earnest against a largely settled Dutch squad that shows only a few changes from two years ago. Those nine wins in qualification were followed by the 3-2 defeat by Sweden in the final Group E game. A total of 37 goals were scored in the campaign and eight conceded \u2013 an illustration of how the Dutch machine purred again. Van Marwijk is expected to field his strongest team as Stuart Pearce attempts to solve a striker deficit that has left him with the callow Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge and Fraizer Campbell, none of whom has started for England and who have only four appearances between them. Van Marwijk&apos;s successful route to Poland and Ukraine was founded on the firepower of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (12 in eight games), Van Persie (six in six), Dirk Kuyt (six in nine), Ibrahim Afellay (three in six) and Sneijder (three in eight); and on a defence usually manned by Maarten Stekelenburg, Gregory van der Wiel, John Heitinga, Joris Mathijsen and Erik Pieters. On Wednesday Barcelona&apos;s Afellay, Ajax&apos;s Van der Wiel and Tottenham&apos;s Van der Vaart are unavailable \u2013 though Pieters has just returned from a broken toe. Only four months after the ugly display against Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and company Holland signalled they had returned to the football founded by Rinus Michels by routing Sweden, their closest rivals in the group, 4-1 at the Amsterdam Arena with two goals each from Afellay and Huntelaar. Afterwards the latter, who will lead the line against England, said: &quot;When we play combination football like this, it all runs so smoothly and we look really good&quot; while Van der Vaart commented: &quot;It was a pleasure to be on the pitch.&quot; Two other standout displays came against Hungary, who were beaten 4-0 on their own patch before Holland won the return 5-3 a few days later. Yet Van Marwijk is still intent on sending a message to his team that, despite being among the favourites for Euro 2012, complacency is the enemy: &quot;After our magnificent qualification we lost for the first time in a long time. You can always learn from every game you play and we are very confident for the upcoming matches.&quot; This reference from the 59-year-old, a former Borussia Dortmund coach, to the Sweden defeat in what was a meaningless final group game and the 3-0 &quot;friendly&quot; defeat by Germany last November \u2013 a result never welcomed by the Dutch \u2013 indicates how determined Van Marwijk is on not wasting the talent that oozes from his band when the finals start in June. Of their status as fancied winners Marwijk says: &quot;You need to be able to handle it well and I also find it is part of top-level sport that you put pressure on yourself \u2013 you shouldn&apos;t shy away from it.&quot; Holland are in Group B at the championship, which appears the toughest of the four.

Nobody knows for sure, but it might have something to do with a ditch that once cut through the district. &apos;Pijp&apos; has several meanings in Dutch, one of the older ones being a long, narrow stretch of water. That ditch was drained in 1891 and replaced by the Albert Cuypstraat, home to the most famous marketplace in the Netherlands. The Albert Cuypmarkt started as a Saturday market in 1905, but soon became a daily affair (9am-6pm, except Sundays). With over 260 stalls offering fresh fruits and vegetables, clothing, toys and much more you&apos;ll certainly find something to your liking. What&apos;s cool is that the Albert Cuypmarkt directly reflects its multicultural surroundings: almost 150 nationalities live in De Oude Pijp and they all bring their own cuisine. Exotic food is available at the Albert Cuyp long before it goes mainstream in supermarkets. If that ever happens. Quartier Latin     De Oude Pijp area of Amsterdam Photograph: Mike Peek    Let&apos;s go back a little. In the second half of the 19th century, the number of residents in Amsterdam exploded and De Pijp was conceived as the centre of a new, prestigious district wrapped all the way around the existing town. Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann had just spiced up Paris with his famous boulevards, and Amsterdam wanted in on the action. Beautiful houses and wide roads would transform the city into a modern metropolis with a gorgeous central train station at the heart of it all. Sounds nice, huh? Too bad it never happened. Logistical and financial issues forced the city council to cancel the plans and come up with something far more modest. No boulevards, no villas and no train station, but long, narrow roads full of cheap and often inferior housing. Numerous contractors started building without much regard for aesthetics or any overall design of the district. Slumlords often rented out their property by the room to poor students, prostitutes or artists who couldn&apos;t afford a whole house. No, De Pijp wasn&apos;t exactly picturesque compared to the canal district, but that was made up for by its lively and eccentric population. Academics mingled with the working class in countless caf\u00e9s where debates went on until early morning. The flourishing nightlife later drew people from all over the city to this &quot;Quartier Latin&quot; of Amsterdam. Sarphatipark     Sarphatipark, De Oude Pijp, Amsterdam Photograph: Mike Peek    De Pijp consists of two parts: De Oude Pijp discussed in this article and De Nieuwe Pijp, which was built to a higher standard a couple of decades later. Both parts are cut in half by Ceintuurbaan and Sarphatipark. While the stripped-down design of De Oude Pijp originally didn&apos;t include any green spaces, the park was eventually added on a vacant piece of land once assigned to the train station. Sarphatipark is a posh, peaceful oasis in a bustling neighbourhood. Like Vondelpark it was designed in the English garden style. With smart vistas and slight height differences the park appears much bigger than it really is. The centrepiece consists of a gorgeous fountain dedicated to Samuel Sarphati, a 19th-century physician who was very concerned with embellishing Amsterdam. Heineken Brewery     Heineken brewery, Amsterdam Photograph: Mike Peek    De Oude Pijp is inextricably connected to the rich history of perhaps our most famous export product: Heineken beer. Their first brewery opened here in 1863, years before De Pijp became a part of Amsterdam. It expanded several times, most notably with a sober expressionist building constructed in the early 1930s, which still stands today. Some residents of De Oude Pijp spent their entire working lives at Heineken. The brewery closed in 1988 and was largely demolished. The remaining building now houses The Heineken Experience, an interactive museum dedicated to all things barley pop. Discover how they achieved that specific Heineken taste, marvel at 140 years of beer advertising, or get &apos;brewed&apos; yourself in a 4D movie. And yes, you can have a cold one afterwards. Hip and happening The population of De Oude Pijp has diversified considerably since the 1960s. Students are still ingrained on its streetscape, but yuppies and immigrants have discovered the district as well. De Oude Pijp is hip and happening. Nowhere else in Amsterdam will you find a larger concentration of restaurants, caf\u00e9s and bars catering to just about every class and taste. That diversity also makes for a great atmosphere and cultural scene. There are numerous galleries and shops and a cute little music hall called De Badcuyp, which is perhaps the best example of the district&apos;s transformation. De Badcuyp was originally a public bathhouse, since many residents didn&apos;t have a shower at home. Now it&apos;s a stage for musicians from all over the world. De Oude Pijp has come a long way.

I first started selling fruits and vegetables when I was 12 years old and then later switched over to haring and have been here ever since. What kinds of people come here?Everyone! I&apos;ve seen it become more diverse over the years; people from every ethnicity and culture come here now. Tourists used to only come in the summers but now they come all year long. What&apos;s the best day of the week to visit the market?Saturday is the busiest day at the market but that&apos;s also when every single stand is occupied. Do you have any favourite stalls? Bart Kaas Cheese Shop and the Art flower shop right across from me is great. Nice to know about Samuel Sarphati &quot;And shmuel died and all of Israel mourned him,&quot; it reads on Samuel Sarphati&apos;s tombstone just outside of Amsterdam. Sarphati was a man of action who is remembered not just by street signs, a monument and a park, but lives on as one of Amsterdam&apos;s most persevering pioneers. Born shortly before Napoleon&apos;s demise in a time of poverty and filth Sarphati&apos;s Amsterdam was one of fading glory. Refuse and excrement littered the streets and the subsequent epidemics were widespread. After studying medicine the Orthodox Jew became a physician and initialised revolutionary plans to help the most downtrodden of society. From innovative plans for waste management and hygiene, to agricultural advancement and city planning, Sarphati&apos;s influence was widespread. After commissioning the Amstel Hotel and completing the Paleis voor Volksvlijt (Palace of Industry; now the location of de Nederlandsche Bank) Sarphati was knighted. His efforts are often compared to Haussmann&apos;s renovation of Paris in the 19th Century. Nice to know about Freddy Heineken There was seldom a story in Dutch news that so gripped and for so long dominated the public sphere as the kidnapping of Freddy Heineken, the president of Heineken International. Freddy, who took Heineken from a brand primarily known within Dutch borders to one famous worldwide, was taken with his driver on 9 November 1983. The kidnapping took twenty days and resulted in the payment of 35 million guilders (aprox. 15.8 million euros) paid to four kidnappers: Cor van Hout, Willem Holleeder, Frans Meijer, Jan Boellaard and Martin Erkamps. The onslaught of reporting that followed resulted in an epic-crime novel type of obsession with the story. Two culprits were immediately caught and two fled to France. After lengthy extradition processes and court trials the four ended up in Dutch jails. Meijer escaped to Paraguay, but was in 1994 found by crime reporter Peter R. de Vries and subsequently imprisoned. All culprits have since been released from jail, but the 2011 film De Heineken Ontvoering, starring Rutger Hauer, recently reignited debates in the media.

Only a local knows how to play the tables (and drink for a buck) in Vegas, or where find the best pizza in Brookyln. The city guides series has been such a success \u2013 becoming one of the most popular features on the Travel website \u2013 that we decided to invite some of the writers and bloggers who helped us put the 11 individual guides together to expand our coverage, with the launch today of the Guardian Travel Network. This reciprocal partnership involves Guardian Travel publishing fun and quirky pieces from our network of bloggers, with links back to the original blog, so you can get an on-the-spot view of, say, how the celebrations in Berlin to mark the 35th anniversary of the recording of David Bowie&apos;s seminal Low album are shaping up, or where to brunch when in Rome. In return, the bloggers will publish some of our content on their own sites. And it means we get to choose the very best and most informative pieces to enrich our site. More than any other newspaper the Guardian promotes diversity of content and open journalism, and what better way to embrace that ethos than to join forces with guest writers from a wide variety of cities and backgrounds. We kick off with four excellent blogs that show you a side to their cities you would never find in a guidebook or on a mainstream travel website: The contributions from Istanbul Eats to our city guides were so good they had the travel desk salivating.

The name Invisible Paris tells you what this blogger is all about, and here he finds a deserted &quot;urban theme park&quot; on the outskirts of the city combined with a walk along the canal. The quirky Spitalfields Life blog showcases some brilliant art and photography from in and around the trendy London neighbourhood (check out Patricia Niven&apos;s Surma Centre Portraits of Bangladeshi men who came to Britain in the 1950s and 60s). James Pearson-Howes&apos;s Top Deck series of photographs captures London&apos;s East End from a bus. Riding on the top of a bus is something millions of Londoners do every day, but viewed as snapshots of time they take on a fascinating new life of their own. The post also illustrates the type of blog we want to showcase on the network \u2013 idiosyncratic, amusing and informative with a strong local angle. Spitalfields is only a couple of miles up the road from Guardian Towers but we would probably not have come across this great little photo-story without the Spitalfields Life blog.

She stands there naked, her body covered from chest to thighs by an acoustic guitar, nothing less than you might expect from an artist whose every action seems designed to polarise. O&apos;Connor has spent the past 25 years forcing onlookers to take sides: depending on your tastes, she&apos;s either an attention-seeker whose capricious behaviour has taxed fans&apos; loyalty for years, or one of pop&apos;s bravest artists. Lately, she has been particularly brave \u2013 or capricious. She&apos;s releasing her first album in five years, How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?, but the occasion has been eclipsed, to put it mildly, by events in her personal life. Since last summer, they have run roughly thus: in August she whimsically advertised online for a boyfriend, found one and quickly married him, split up with him and was reconciled (twice), attempted suicide and was hospitalised, either for depression or bipolar disorder (professional diagnoses have differed; she herself thinks she has post-traumatic stress disorder after being abused by her mother when she was a child). That&apos;s the past seven months in a nutshell, and it&apos;s been a bruising time, both for her and her new husband, Barry Herridge, a therapist employed by the Irish government to counsel young substance abusers. Is she ever told she&apos;s brave? She looks at me incredulously across a dimly lit dressing room backstage at The Graham Norton Show, where she will later play her new single, The Wolf is Getting Married. &quot;No.&quot; Silly question, really. Over the years, O&apos;Connor has said she&apos;s been consistently misunderstood by the media, and &quot;nasty people&quot; generally. Recently, she has taken to her website to express her feelings, and some of her posts are wrenching to read. This, from a few months ago, is typical: &quot;Since my first record all that has happened is I get treated like a crazy person, in a world where crazy is used as a stick with which to beat someone. It&apos;s very nasty \u2026 And loads of people then in ur life think its ok to treat u like shit and dismiss u as &apos;mad&apos;. Its very sore.&quot; Yet when she&apos;s happy, her writing is full of mischief, as in the boyfriend &quot;ad&quot;, which she originally wrote as an article for the Irish Independent. In it, she wittily and explicitly detailed what she expected of a man (hence the &quot;adult themes&quot; warning). It was a moment of lighthearted openness that, she says now, the media won&apos;t let her forget. &quot;The reaction I had from people \u2026 the usual, &apos;She&apos;s mental,&apos; and that it was the culmination of my lack of self-esteem. &apos;Send social services round!&apos; It made me depressed about being me.&quot; O&apos;Connor is governed by the need to express herself \u2013 it&apos;s clear she gets much of her strength from putting her feelings in the public domain, whatever the repercussions. At the moment, she&apos;s &quot;in the middle of a wrangle&quot; with an American magazine for that very reason. &quot;It&apos;s over an interview with a cunt who wrangled an interview out of me when I was depressed recently. He said it&apos;d be a respectful interview about mental health, but he ended up saying I was crazy for saying I liked sex.&quot; Bespectacled and dressed in head-to-toe black \u2013 hoodie, leather trousers, T-shirt imprinted with Jesus&apos;s face \u2013 she&apos;s sipping coffee and girding herself for her encounter with Norton. The wire-rimmed glasses are a newish addition. She&apos;s 45 now and says she needs them, but also uses them as a shield when she&apos;s onstage: &quot;They&apos;re like sunglasses \u2013 they put a bit of distance between me and the audience. I&apos;m very shy when I sing.&quot; Nonetheless, she&apos;s looking forward to being in front of the cameras: &quot;Today has been a good self-esteem day.&quot; It started with being interviewed on BBC Breakfast, where she was asked unexpectedly knowledgeable questions about the album. One of the programme&apos;s staff told her afterwards that the presenters loved the album; nine hours later, she&apos;s still smiling. It made a change from the day before, when she was doing promotion in Amsterdam. &quot;I&apos;ve had 25 years of people treating me like a crazy person, and I&apos;ve not been well recently. And these journalists were trying to find evidence of my extreme madness.&quot; It would take a leap of the imagination to find anything mad about her right now. She speaks so quickly and quietly that some of her words get lost in the Dublin-accented flow, but she&apos;s cogent and very droll. (On her four children, who all have different dads: &quot;Father&apos;s Day is a bit of a revolving door at my house.&quot;) And she has great faith in How About I Be Me?, which has received the warmest reviews she&apos;s had in a decade. One American critic even pronounced it a &quot;full-on revival&quot;, and, in effect, it is. It&apos;s her first &quot;pop&quot; album since 2000&apos;s Faith and Courage, and the most accessible thing she&apos;s done since. In the intervening years, there have been a record of traditional Irish songs, a reggae album and a collection of religious songs, all of which sold poorly and rendered her almost a niche artist. Most of the media coverage in that time focused on her personal life \u2013 her coming out as a lesbian (and subsequent back-pedalling) and her marriages (Herridge is her fourth husband). Her voice, always a thing of silvery, spectral beauty, was almost forgotten.            Many of the 7 million people who bought her 1990 breakthrough, I Do Not Want What I Haven&apos;t Got, jumped ship years ago, but those who remain will find her voice is breathier but still true, and her ability to write singular songs undiminished. The new album&apos;s hymnlike closing track, VIP, is one of the most striking pieces she has ever recorded. Whether or not it gets into the charts, O&apos;Connor is happy with it. &quot;A lot of people say, &apos;You destroyed your career by tearing up a picture of the pope&apos;&quot; \u2013 on an infamous apperance on US TV in 1992 \u2013 &quot;but I define success differently in this spiritually bereft business. To me, it&apos;s &apos;Can I be myself?&apos; I could stand in the street and sing and get enough to pay the bills. I don&apos;t need millions of dollars. That was why I tore up the pope&apos;s picture \u2013 I knew I had enough money that I didn&apos;t have to marry a man with a very small penis to get the bills paid. I don&apos;t want any man to have control over me. And that is success.&quot; In fact, men figure prominently on the album, but strictly on her terms. The record is dedicated to her novelist brother Joseph and to her former boyfriend, and father of her youngest child, Frank Bonadio (with whom she seems to be on the most amiable terms: &quot;He wants to meet girls, he wants me to advertise him. I want to put him on dating sites, but he&apos;s too shy&quot;). Moreover, some of the songs are about being euphorically in love. From the opening track, 4th and Vine \u2013 a skiffle-ish bit of fun narrated by a bride preparing for her wedding (&quot;I&apos;m gonna put my pink dress on and do my hair up tight/I&apos;m gonna put some eyeliner on, I&apos;m gonna look real nice&quot;) \u2013 to the stately ballad Old Lady, about having a crush on someone who &quot;makes me laugh like an idiot, not be so serious&quot;, the record shows O&apos;Connor&apos;s tender side. Her unwavering campaign to hold the Vatican accountable for child abuse in the Irish church, and her frustration that other Irish artists refuse to join her, are represented on Take Off Your Shoes and VIP respectively. Her own favourite, though, is I Had a Baby, a subdued piece of electronica that addresses &quot;the difficulties a child suffers from parental abandonment&quot;. She allows that it&apos;s about her second-youngest son (there are three sons and a daughter, aged six to 24), but adds: &quot;I don&apos;t want to talk about the songs, because it takes away the magic.&quot; She now has a good relationship with her children&apos;s fathers, she adds. Nonetheless, what sticks after several listens isn&apos;t the painful songs but the joyous ones, in which she luxuriates in being close to her lover. But the assumption that they&apos;re about Barry Herridge is incorrect. &quot;It was written between 2007-09, and recorded in 2010-11. I was going out with [Bonadio] and writing these songs. My creative process is quite slow. I hear melodies in my head while I&apos;m washing the dishes and I allow my subconscious to do the work.&quot; The album&apos;s title came more recently, though. &quot;My experience for 25 years&quot; \u2013 ever since her 1987 debut, The Lion and the Cobra \u2013 &quot;is that I&apos;ve had a lot of people&apos;s opinions of me shoved down my throat. Then I wrote [the Irish Independent] articles last summer because I wanted to join a dating agency and I wanted to save the registration fee, so I\u00a0wrote my own ad.&quot; The article, and accompanying tweets about being sex-starved, while written with much self-deprecating humour (&quot;My sh*t-uation sexually/affectionately speaking is so dire that inanimate objects are starting to look good \u2026 I must end now, as I have a hot date with a banana&quot;), attracted derision. She was accused of humiliating herself \u2013 and, of course, some assumed she had done it to court publicity for the new album. One night, feeling depressed, she was lying in bed and the phrase &quot;how about I be me and you be you?&quot; came to mind. As a summation of her current mood \u2013 embattled but defiant \u2013 it couldn&apos;t be better. Presumably, the turbulence of recent months will inspire a new set of songs? She shakes her head. &quot;I write from a different place now. There&apos;s nothing in the recent past I want to write about.&quot; Yet the recent past hasn&apos;t been all bad: not only did it produce her husband, there was a Golden Globe nomination for the song Lay Your Head Down, from the film Albert Nobbs. And when she sings, people still respond. A couple of hours later, now wearing a leather corset that displays Jesus&apos;s face tattooed across her chest, she performs The Wolf is Getting Married. A technical hitch means she and her band have to run through it twice; both times, the audience&apos;s applause is loud and warm. When she leaves the stage, her face is the happiest it has been all\u00a0night.

First off though is Harold Pinter&apos;s 1978 three-hander, inspired by the playwright&apos;s relationship with Joan Bakewell, which uses reverse chronology to excavate a seven-year affair from its end back to the moment it began.

Now he returns home and to the newly rebuilt Sherman theatre to direct his own adaptation of Chekhov&apos;s story about life in provincial Russia in the 1890s. The story of a young man, aware of his privilege, who longs to create a society based on equality, the show will have a strong Welsh flavour, and a large cast of professional and semi-professional actors.

There was the endemic corruption, obviously, and the usual posse of self-serving politicians. But no one was expecting a bloodbath, least of all Battaglia. She was already a\u00a040-year-old mother of three, enjoying her first steady job as picture editor of a city newspaper. She wasn&apos;t looking to cover a war. But war, it seemed, had decided to come looking for her. Sitting at a low table in her eighth-floor apartment in Palermo, Battaglia, now 76, flicks through some of the iconic images she captured during what Italians call the anni di piombo, the years of (flying) lead. Eighteen years in which the ferocious Corleonesi mafia clan would claim the lives of governors, senior policemen, entire mafia families and, ultimately, two of Battaglia&apos;s dearest friends: the anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. This May marks the 20th anniversary of Falcone&apos;s assassination by a massive motorway bomb, which also killed the husband of Rosaria Schifani, one of Falcone&apos;s bodyguards. In the intervening years the big drug-trafficking wars have shifted, on a blood meridian, from Sicily to the Mexican border. But Battaglia&apos;s photographs testify that nothing has changed, that none of this is new. The techniques pioneered by the Corleonesi have proved their efficacy. Maximum violence. Total extermination of your rivals. Intimidation of the state. If horror still lurches reliably out of Battaglia&apos;s pictures, so do the more complicated emotions of pity and despair. To many, these are the qualities that elevate them to the status of art. Battaglia&apos;s reputation has steadily risen over the years, attracting awards and exhibition space as far afield as New York and Amsterdam. But long before the foreign prizes and plaudits arrived, she&apos;d already received domestic recognition of a more heartfelt kind: death threats. That Battaglia ignored the threats, despite being advised to lie low by Falcone himself, comes as no surprise once you&apos;ve met her. At first she puts you at ease with her husky laugh and friendly little dog, Pippo. Her apartment is dark and cool, the walls adorned with two of her more soothing photographic portraits: a\u00a0girl, and a dove. Further along is a framed Red Flag (it&apos;s from India, sent by a daughter), which seems in keeping with Battaglia&apos;s bohemian dress and 60s fringe. Beyond the bookshelves is a balcony, its tiles and pot plants shining in the summer sun. Framed by the door the view could almost be a photo, a sanitised vision of the sunny present. But once her eyes have fixed on you, her intensity is revealed. Let your gaze drift down to your notebook when she is declaiming something and you are abruptly reprimanded. &quot;Look me in the eyes!&quot; She is deadly serious. She insists on being heard. She smokes a lot. During the height of the violence Battaglia would get called out at all hours of the day and night, and be on the scene of a murder, pushing through ghoulish crowds of onlookers, before the blood of the dead had begun to dry. It was unrelenting: they would find as many as seven bodies at a time. No sooner had she and her colleagues raced across town on mopeds to cover one killing, than they would receive news of another hit. &quot;Before you&apos;d even dealt with the desperation and suffering of one murder, you were already on the way to another. More blood, more violence.&quot; But she didn&apos;t stop. This was never just a job. It was her duty as a citizen, she believed. And it showed. These urgent, often grainy shots were politics of the most incendiary kind. They were asking a question that no one at the time wanted, or dared, to hear: why? &quot;The worst thing was that we didn&apos;t understand at first where this inferno came from, she says. &quot;No one knew about the Corleonesi. No one was getting caught for these crimes. And they always killed the best people. The best judges, the best policemen, the best politicians. It took years to understand what was going on, thanks to the work of Falcone and the testimony of the pentito Tommaso Buscetta.&quot; Battaglia&apos;s inability to shield herself from the horrors she witnessed is still evident. At one point she shudders and asks me to put away a photo taken by her then-boyfriend and fellow photographer, Franco Zecchin. The photo in question has an almost surreal quality to it \u2013 three bored-looking young men slouch in the back of a bus, looking for all the world as if they haven&apos;t realised they&apos;re dead yet. However, Battaglia didn&apos;t only photograph corpses. She ranged across Sicily, taking in religious festivals, psychiatric hospitals, crumbling slums and aristocratic salons. The stars of her photos are often young women, quietly enduring their various predicaments. The compassion that shines out of these portraits dispels any doubts one might entertain while wading through the bloodier end of her catalogue. Her art is not exploitative \u2013 it is about exploitation. Though Battaglia describes her own childhood as serene, it was also suffocatingly cloistered. Palermo after the war was not a place for independent-minded girls and her father was possessive. He kept her locked up in the family home. &quot;I couldn&apos;t go out because men would bother me on the street, even at 11 years of age,&quot; she says. Life with her jealous father soon became intolerable and at the first opportunity she bolted, which in those days meant marriage \u2013 at the age of 16, to a prosperous older man who worked in the coffee business. Three children followed, but little happiness. Twenty-one years would pass before Battaglia finally mustered the courage to walk out. In a country where divorce was still illegal and feminism just a distant rumour, she installed herself and her daughters in the single room of an &quot;alternative&quot; household in Milan. She was penniless but free. Her family considered her ruined. In Milan she learned her craft as a photo-reporter and soon, despite her family&apos;s forebodings, she was enjoying success and all the other things she&apos;d previously lacked in life: creativity, independence, intellectual friends. Among these was the Sicilian author Leonardo Sciascia. It was he who later wrote a catty article that labelled Borsellino as a &quot;professional of the anti-mafia&quot;. The article was seized upon by the judge&apos;s enemies and used to isolate him. Five years later both he and Falcone were blown up by two separate bombs, one after the other. The judges knew it was coming. As Falcone said: &quot;It is my destiny to take a bullet from the mafia one day. The only thing I don&apos;t know is when.&quot; &quot;Sciascia was an adorable person, but he had an outdated idea of the mafia,&quot; Battaglia says. &quot;He made a mistake with that article, but I forgave him.&quot; As for Falcone and Borsellino, she has only praise. &quot;I have two photographs of each of us together, taken by my daughter. They are the most important photographs of my life. I was proud to know them. These two brave Sicilians died to defend us.&quot; But perhaps the most important friendship she made was with the maverick anti-mafia mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, with whom she served both on the city council and as a deputy in the regional parliament. &quot;Those were the most beautiful years of my life. Better than being in love, or having children.&quot; A price must be paid for this kind of political commitment. It was difficult for her daughters; it was difficult for her, too. When she bought an apartment in one of the roughest parts of town, intending to share the people&apos;s problems, she was repeatedly burgled under the eyes of her neighbours who, true to form, never saw a\u00a0thing. A cynic might suggest this was a classic case of a communist intellectual showing solidarity with the masses, and the masses failing to reciprocate. But at least the thieves didn&apos;t steal her negatives. Battaglia&apos;s immense archive would provide sensational evidence when the former Italian prime minister Giulio Andreotti found himself in court answering charges of links to the mafia. Battaglia, years before, had taken a photo of him during a visit to Sicily which unwittingly showed him in the company of a\u00a0mafioso. Despite this, the prosecution never succeeded in securing a conviction. It was a defeat for the anti-mafia movement, one of many. But despite the difficulties of winning cases such as these, Battaglia believes that the answer to defeating Cosa Nostra is deceptively simple. &quot;The mafia can be beaten, but only if people stop voting for dishonest politicians. It&apos;s no longer just a Sicilian problem. It&apos;s all over Italy.&quot; Battaglia no longer does reportage \u2013 &quot;I&apos;m too old to keep walking the streets&quot; \u2013 but she regularly visits schools and attends anti-mafia events, however lost the cause may seem sometimes. Is this what people mean when they describe her as impegnata, involved? &quot;It means setting an example,&quot; she says. &quot;It means opposing the mafia in everything that I\u00a0say and buy and eat. Every person that I meet, every gesture that I make, it&apos;s all connected to the need to liberate my country from the mafia.&quot; In a city like Palermo, where the vast majority of shops and businesses pay extortion money, that&apos;s not as easy as it sounds. In fact, Battaglia doesn&apos;t go out much any more, except in the morning to walk the dog. She avoids contact with the city&apos;s middle classes, deemed guilty of what she calls moral absenteeism. She admits: &quot;Palermo is a bit of a\u00a0prison for me \u2013 it holds me down. Every now and then I need to get away. I even moved to Paris for a year and a half, but I couldn&apos;t help thinking about Palermo \u2013 despite all of its problems, its shit, its corruption, which is even worse now than it was before.&quot; These symptoms of embittered love will be familiar to anyone who has lived in Sicily for an extended period of time. The place is infuriating, self-destructive and very nearly hopeless, but you can&apos;t shake it off. As Battaglia&apos;s friend Sciascia once said: &quot;I hate and detest Sicily insofar as I love it, and insofar as it does not respond to the kind of love I would like to have for it.&quot;", "sentences": ["Battaglia&apos;s reputation has steadily risen over the years, attracting awards and exhibition space as far afield as New York and Amsterdam."], "title": "Letizia Battaglia: shooting the mafia", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/04/letizia-battaglia-mafia-photographer-sicily", "tags": ["Photography", "Mafia", "Women", "Italy", "Art and design", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-04T17:15:42Z", "article": "Opening this week Theatre Red Light Winter The UK premiere of Adam Rapp&apos;s Obie Award-winning play about two successful New Yorkers, once college room mates, whose trip to the Red Light district of Amsterdam comes back to haunt them.

Four trains were cancelled on Tuesday morning: one London-Paris service, one London-Brussels, one Brussels-London and one Paris-London. On Monday night thousands of Eurostar customers were held in trains for hours as the cross-Channel service suffered cancellations and severe delays due to emergency repair works. Eurostar said the disruption, which affected customers including designers and models making their way to Paris fashion week, was caused by a power cable failing on the French side of the track. Dozens of international trains had to be diverted from their high-speed line on to regular branch lines for safety as the power company EDF made emergency repairs to the broken cable. Therese Kelly, who was stuck for eight hours, told the BBC: &quot;We had no announcements about why the train was so delayed or why it kept stopping. The train didn&apos;t move for hours. The whole train journey was brutal, totally brutal.&quot; Model Laura Bailey, a face of Marks &amp; Spencer, tweeted: &quot;Eurostar rage more civilised than easyJet rage, but only just. #fashionablylate?&quot; Ryan Armstrong, who was travelling to Amsterdam via London, said he missed his connecting flight because of the delays. He said: &quot;We were basically on the train for nine hours. We hardly moved. There was a lot of standing still.

Eurostar apologised for the severe delays but said the problem was &quot;out of its control&quot; as the broken power cable was not part of its train service but belonged to EDF. A spokesperson said the re-routing of trains off the high-speed line caused a backlog of Eurostar trains but that, aside from the morning cancellations, all services had returned to normal. &quot;We were always going to get people to where they wanted to be. But the speed at which this happened was controlled by how quickly we get the backlog moving again,&quot; the spokesperson said.", "sentences": ["#fashionablylate?&quot; Ryan Armstrong, who was travelling to Amsterdam via London, said he missed his connecting flight because of the delays."], "title": "Eurostar cancellations continue after customers endure nine-hour journeys", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/06/eurostar-problems-continue-nine-hours", "tags": ["Eurostar", "Transport", "Business", "Paris fashion week autumn/winter 2012", "Life and style", "Fashion weeks", "Paris fashion week", "Fashion", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-06T15:01:44Z", "article": "How do you portray someone&apos;s interior life? It is one thing to depict outer beauty or ugliness, to capture appearances. That is what painting, and photography, are pre-set to do. But how does an artist see beyond the distractions of faces and clothes to hint at the hidden world of thoughts and emotions? In his painting Woman Reading a Letter, the 17th-century Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer achieves this by depicting the most private of all cultural acts: reading. This great painting has just been restored and is going back on view at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The blue of the woman&apos;s gown looks deeper than ever, the light from a window that creeps across a map hanging on the wall more silvery. It is a new chance to appreciate one of the most profound of all paintings. Vermeer is a very objective artist. As far as we can tell from his views of the inside and outside of houses in Delft where he lived, he paints what he sees. Furnishings and decorations \u2013 including maps and paintings that he hangs on the wall to introduce layers of symbolism \u2013 are all real, and painted with meticulous accuracy. Women pose for him, dressed presumably as they appear in his pictures. But through his almost scientific scrutiny of visible phenomena, he tells of invisible passions and secret selves. The letter reader in his masterpiece in the Rijksmuseum may be studying a love letter \u2013 that&apos;s what we feel from her deep absorption in its contents. Or she may be reading news from a war, for the map behind her suggests navies and armies and campaigns. But what holds us is the act of reading itself, and the look it gives the reader: she is in another world, unaware of the colours and details of the scene that attract us. For her, only the words on that sheet of paper exist. She has forgotten that she is being looked at \u2013 by Vermeer \u2013 as she reads. She is in her own place, a place of the mind. This painting stops time. Looking at it you are drawn into the reader&apos;s rapt moment, and forget the beauty of the scene. It invites everyone who looks at it to share this silent, absorbed moment of reading. Dutch art in the 17th-century abounds in visual information. It shows us, like a photograph, exactly what life looked like there and then. But its deepest moments draw away from the dazzle of appearances into the darkness of introspection. Rembrandt is far bolder in the way he goes about this. The shadows and golds of his paintings, ripe with contrast and drama, delve straight into the soul. People seem to look back at you from his epic portraits. Vermeer does not reach for the grandeur that is natural to Rembrandt. He paints the quiet room, the morning light, the woman reading a letter.

A couple of decades ago, I used to say that SustainAbility had three key critical global advantages: its name; the emergence of English as the international language of business; and London, particularly Heathrow as a portal to the rest of the world. And all that was brought back to mind last week when I walked into Generation Investment Management&apos;s offices in Piccadilly. That same morning, I received an email asking me to draft a list of people to invite to SustainAbility&apos;s 25th anniversary event in London on 30 April. I began casting back over the decades, recalling many of the people who had passed through our offices. One person who came to mind from the very early years was Toronto-based Nick Parker, who coined the term cleantech and founded the Cleantech Group. Now Chairman of a Canadian state corporation, I put him on the list. Then, as a couple of us walked into Generation&apos;s glass-walled offices a few hours later, there he was \u2013 talking to the person we were about to meet. Within minutes we had caught up and agreed that he would come to the April event. And my mind was primed to think about cleantech when, later the same day, a spontaneous email came through from the Cleantech Group, inviting me to download their latest report, Coming Clean. The title caught my eye partly because we had used it for SustainAbility&apos;s first report on corporate environmental reporting, way back in 1993. But I was also interested because I have been increasingly involved in the cleantech world over the past decade \u2013 and because WWF, with which I have now had a 50-year history, is a partner in the Global Cleantech Innovation Index project. With the Green Economy story now central to thinking about how we build and fuel what we have dubbed the Phoenix Economy, I am fascinated to see how indexing, ranking and rating schemes can help spur government and political ambitions. So, having downloaded the report, the first thing was to get a sense of who is currently doing best in cleantech. Who is providing the best conditions for clean technology startup creation? The answer won&apos;t come as a huge surprise to anyone tracking the field: the leading country in the 2012 index is Denmark, followed by Israel, Sweden, Finland and the US, with companies in the Asia Pacific region following closely behind when it comes to commercial success. A total of 38 countries were evaluated on 15 indicators related to the creation and commercialisation of cleantech startups. This generated an index that measured each one&apos;s potential, relative to their economic size, to produce entrepreneurial cleantech startup companies and commercialise clean technology innovations over the next decade. Richard Youngman, the Cleantech Group&apos;s managing director for Europe and Aisa stressed: &quot;The global macro-economic landscape is shifting; fostering entrepreneurial start-ups and growth companies with clean technology solutions will be an increasingly important part of countries&apos; competitiveness on the world stage.&quot; Strikingly, the four top-scoring countries all have small economies. But while they are the source of much innovation, the authors underscore the uncomfortable fact that &quot;they have less ability to scale-up companies&quot;. As a result, &quot;these small countries need innovative approaches and collaboration to compensate for the lack of large domestic markets and inconsistent availability of finance throughout a company&apos;s life-cycle&quot;. &quot;The overwhelming majority of capital required for making the transition to a low-carbon future will come from a variety of private sources,&quot; said Samantha Smith, leader of WWF&apos;s Global Climate and Energy Initiative. &quot;Developing a working recipe for strengthening the flow of public-private finance towards early as well as later-stage cleantech is key for countries that want to taste the economic success of cleantech.&quot; North America and northern Europe are still the primary contributors to the development of innovative cleantech companies. The US placed fifth in the Index, its team notes. &quot;However in absolute terms, without factoring in economic size, the United States leads in many measures of cleantech innovation: the country has the greatest public cleantech R&amp;D budget, the greatest number of cleantech startups and investors, as well as the most venture capital, private equity, and M&amp;A deals in cleantech.&quot; And what about the Asia Pacific region? It performs well in relation to scaling up entrepreneurial cleantech companies and to wider commercial success and revenue creation. Indeed, while currently producing fewer cleantech startups and placing 13th, China now leads in cleantech manufacturing, is strong in early-stage growth, and shows considerable potential to produce more early stage innovation in the future. Among other things, China has been home to the majority of cleantech IPOs since 2009, many of which listed on the recently established ChiNext board of the Shenzhen stock exchange. Similarly, India scores 12th in the 2012 Index, but is performing well in fund raising for cleantech-focused initiatives, and has significant activity under way in later stage cleantech companies. As the Cleantech Group concludes: &quot;While climate change negotiations may prevaricate market forces do not. Every day, from Amsterdam to Zhongguancun, a new cleantech company is being founded or invested in, setting out on its own journey to make its contribution to that sustainability revolution.&quot; The key to progress at the national level is to create the ecosystems necessary to enable innovation, enterprise and scaling. Nick Parker, for example, is now working to help late-stage entrepreneurial ventures break into the Asian market. Critically, a key conclusion of the survey is that &quot;completely new science and technology breakthrough companies are rare, though they do exist&quot;. My conclusion: in pushing towards our TEDxThames conference on Breakthrough Capitalism, we must focus both on incremental and transformative, systemic change \u2013 but with a focus on the latter. As I have argued elsewhere, it&apos;s time to punctuate some equilibriums.

Photograph: AP    A Dutch fashion model turned furniture-maker has won her case against an international modelling agency after it rejected her for having hips that were &quot;too large&quot;. Ananda Marchildon, 25, is now entitled to the remainder of the prize money she won four years ago in the television show Holland&apos;s Next Top Model, which the agency, Elite, withheld after arguing she had not lost enough weight. The Amsterdam district court said on Wednesday that Marchildon should receive \u20ac65,000 (\u00a354,000) equivalent to the rest of the three-year contract she was awarded, of which she only received \u20ac10,000 before her dismissal. Much of the case hung on whether or not Marchildon had been asked to reduce her hip size to below what it had been when she won. An email exchange between the two parties provided key evidence. On 23\u00a0March 2010, the agency wrote to the model: &quot;Today\u00a0\u2026 we measured your hips at 98 centimeters [sic]. This is a reminder! The goal is that you have a hip circumference of no more than 90 cm at the end of June.&quot; Marchildon, who said she went on a strict diet and took copious amounts of exercise, responded that she was prepared to regain her former shape but would go no further. &quot;If at the end of the road it appears that unfortunately not enough assignments have come in, that doesn&apos;t change the obligations of the contract,&quot; she wrote. But according to the court ruling although the 180cm tall (5&apos;11&quot;) model had put on weight since gaining the contract, she had had a hip measurement of 92cm (36.2 inches) at the time of winning and the agency went too far by demanding she reduce it to 90cm. &quot;Elite had no right to demand Marchildon reach a hip size of 90cm,&quot; the court ruled. After the ruling Marchildon told the Daily Beast: &quot;A huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. After almost two years of struggling I was finally proven right.&quot; She was commissioned for a photo shoot on Wednesday by an underwear company who called Marchildon &quot;a beautiful woman&quot;, adding: &quot;It&apos;s too crazy for words that a model who&apos;s her size would be written off as too fat.&quot; In a statement, Marchildon, who became a cabinet maker after leaving the agency last September, said she planned to return to making furniture.", "sentences": ["The Amsterdam district court said on Wednesday that Marchildon should receive \u20ac65,000 (\u00a354,000) equivalent to the rest of the three-year contract she was awarded, of which she only received \u20ac10,000 before her dismissal."], "title": "'Too fat' model wins case against agency who dropped her", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/mar/07/too-fat-model-wins-case", "tags": ["Models", "Life and style", "Fashion", "Women", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-07T18:56:30Z", "article": "Sir Alex Ferguson has warned Manchester United must &quot;waken up&quot; from their European malaise at Old Trafford or risk a second early exit of the season when they face Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League on Thursday night. United have toiled at home in European competition all season and almost compounded their failure in the Champions League group phase by falling to Ajax on their debut in the Europa League. The Amsterdam club&apos;s 2-1 win in the last-32 second-leg ended an 11-game undefeated home run for Ferguson&apos;s team in Europe and the Dutch side needed only one more goal to progress at United&apos;s expense despite trailing 3-0 on aggregate after six minutes at Old Trafford. The result also left United with only one win from four home European matches this term, and Ferguson admits a vast improvement is required against Marcelo Bielsa&apos;s impressive side. The United manager said: &quot;It&apos;s a very difficult tie. From what we&apos;ve seen, Bilbao are a very progressive team in Spain at the moment and it&apos;s going to be a difficult game for us. It&apos;s a game in which we need to waken up, there&apos;s no question about that. Some of our European form this season has been disappointing but it&apos;s an opportunity to progress and we have to take that opportunity. But it will need a very good performance.&quot; Ferguson cited complacency as a factor in United&apos;s Champions League demise and took the blame for the Ajax defeat himself, having fielded a young defence. He claimed that lesson, at least, has been learned and an experienced United team is expected to start the last-16 first leg. &quot;I don&apos;t know if we&apos;re making too many changes in these games,&quot; he added. &quot;Certainly in the second leg against Ajax we did that, and in the Champions League group stage we made some changes. But we made mistakes in the group stage too, so it&apos;s our own fault. But we&apos;ll play a strong side against Bilbao and hopefully that makes a difference.&quot; Bilbao are fifth in La Liga and have secured a place in the final of the Copa del Rey against Barcelona, with their coveted centre-forward Fernando Llorente \u2013 scorer of 13 goals in 22 league games this season \u2013 highlighted as an obvious threat by Ferguson. He said: &quot;Unlike [most] centre-forwards from Spain, he&apos;s tall and a great header of the ball. His scoring record is very good this year. &quot;They&apos;ve got different qualities from a lot of Spanish teams. They press the ball very well and they&apos;re not afraid to flood players forward in attack. They&apos;re very positive and have no hesitation in committing themselves to attack at any point, with a number of players. It&apos;s the best Athletic Bilbao team I&apos;ve seen for some years.&quot; Ferguson is confident, however, that the recent improvement in his goalkeeper David de Gea, plus the central-defensive partnership of Rio Ferdinand and Jonny Evans, gives United a platform to stifle the threat from the Basque club. &quot;Ferdinand&apos;s form in particular over the last couple of months has been outstanding,&quot; he said. &quot;It does tell you that when you play two partners together for longer periods rather than chop and change it makes a difference. Jonny Evans has emerged through having the experience of playing with Rio, so that&apos;s been a plus for us. I&apos;ll accept 1-0 against Bilbao rather than 2-1 or 3-2 without question.&quot; De Gea produced a vital late save against Ajax at Old Trafford, as he has done against Chelsea, Liverpool, Norwich and others, to claim the United supporters&apos; player of the month award for February. And Ferguson admits the decision to take the young Spaniard out of the team following the FA Cup defeat at Liverpool has paid dividends. The United manager said: &quot;He had a bad game against Liverpool and I felt he was better than that. He had to get his confidence back in terms of handling that particular defeat because if you lose to Liverpool it&apos;s a big defeat. Since then he&apos;s been outstanding. He&apos;s grasped the nettle, his training performances have been fantastic and he&apos;s transferred that into the game situation very well.&quot; De Gea concurred: &quot;The time I spent on the bench when I was out of the team I could reflect, think hard and regroup. I started working harder to come out of that spell. It made me more determined so when I did get that opportunity to get back in the side I grabbed it with both hands. The thing now is to keep this good form because you know that one slight slip-up and you&apos;ve got quality players waiting in the wings to grab their opportunity as well.&quot;", "sentences": ["The Amsterdam club&apos;s 2-1 win in the last-32 second-leg ended an 11-game undefeated home run for Ferguson&apos;s team in Europe and the Dutch side needed only one more goal to progress at United&apos;s expense despite trailing 3-0 on aggregate after six minutes at Old Trafford."], "title": "Manchester United must be wide awake to deal with Athletic Bilbao", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/07/manchester-united-athletic-bilbao-europa-league", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Athletic Bilbao", "Europa League 2011-12", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-08T21:57:00Z", "article": " Paul will be here from 8pm or whenever the City match finishes.

Read the entire story here.  Preamble on the fly: Just teleported from Lisbon to Old Trafford so allow me a moment to reconstitute myself. While I do that, perhaps the United fans amongst you could cobble together an answer to this question: would you prefer City to crach out against Sporting Lisbon in this round or to meet them yourselves in the final? (I ask that there is a good chance a Bilbao victory will make it redundant later?)  Man Utd: De Gea, Rafael Da Silva, Smalling, Evans, Evra, Park, Jones, Giggs, Young, Rooney, Hernandez. Subs: Amos, Ferdinand, Anderson, Carrick, Nani, Welbeck, Fabio Da Silva. Athletic Bilbao: Iraizoz, Iraola, Javi Martinez, San Jose, Aurtenetxe, Iturraspe, De Marcos, Ander Herrera, Susaeta, Llorente, Muniain. Subs: Raul, Toquero, David Lopez, Koikili, Inigo Perez, Ekiza, Ibai. Referee: Florian Meyer (Germany)  2 min: Bilbao, dressed like Glentoran, make their intentions clear right from the off, going for United&apos;s jugular. There&apos;s zip and precision to their play and United are struggling to get a touch.  3 min: No sooner do United get the ball than they create a prime chance, but Giggs&apos; shot from 10 yards is blocked by San Jos\u00e9.  4 min: This is a great opening to the game, and amid a superb-sounding atmosphere to boot. Llorente almost sends the already-boisterous visiting contingent into raptures by holding off Smalling and flashing a curling drive just past the post from the edge of the box.  7 min: Freekick to United in a good crossing position on the right after Aurtenetxe pulls back Young. Giggs curls it into the danger zone but Iraizoz, unlike Joe Hart earlier today, punches decisively away.  9 min: This is rip-roaring stuff, with both sides going at each other like basketball teams, taking it in turns to attack. Rooney just slipped Park through with a canny reverse pass but Bilbao converged on the Korean to close out the chance.  12 min: Rooney is looking good early doors, constantly coming deep to play incisive balls. In other news, you may have read about the United fanzine Red Issue contemplating suing police. You might also like to read Red Issue&apos;s editoral explaining their thinking.  15 min: After an exhilarating opening the match has become a tad ragged, but the intent of both teams&apos; remains admirably positive. So we&apos;ve either got a classic on our hands or a chaotic thrillride. Or both. Or a mess.  18 min: Any United fans getting flashbacks watching this Llorente lad? He has a touch of Van Nistelrooy about him.  19 min: Iraizoz races out of his box to head clear a through-ball before Rooney could connect with it.  20 min: United are seriously rattled here and should have conceded a penalty a moment ago when Smalling tugged back Llorente in the box. But the ref gave a free the other way instead. &quot;Re: your question in the preamble: It&apos;s easy,&quot; gaps Matt Exton. &quot;City go all the way but lose the final and Utd crash out now and focus on League. Let&apos;s skelp City in the league and take the title.&quot;  GOAL! United 1-0 Bilbao (Rooney 22&apos;) United had been reeling for most of the previous 20 minutes by the speed, precision and the sheer numerical force of Bilbao&apos;s attack. But then they strike back with a splendid goal. Giggs scampered into the box and nudged the ball through to Hernandez, who twisted and turned trickly before firing a wicked low shot at goal. Iraizoz dived low to save well but Rooney follwed up to prod the rebound into the net! That won&apos;t be the last of the scoring tonight.  25 min: Young aborts a promising United attack with a wayward pass. It was intended for Hernandez, who would have been clean through.  27 min: Corner to Athletic. Susaeta takes. It&apos;s poor. So poor that Evans clears.  29 min: This match is so fast the players should be clad into those Formula 1 driver suits rather than jerseys. Llorente will score tonight. He&apos;s just gone close again with a decent header that flew just over. &quot;That was a superb save from the Bilbao keeper before Rooney tucked away the rebound,&quot; gulps Francis Lee. &quot;Has the Guardian ever had a Youtube special of ace saves consigned to the dusty archives for ultimately failing to prevent a goal being scored?&quot; Don&apos;t remember, but probably. Google it, man, Google it.  32 min: Just as their team is being largely ourtplayed, United fans are being outshouted and outsung ... and now, as United finally enjoy a bout of possession, outwhistled.  33 min: What a miss! That should have been 1-1! Susaeta got the jump on the dozing Evans to race on to a clipped pass over the top. De Gea came surging off his line to block but had no chance of getting there and basically just invited the elementary lob ... but Susaeta lifted it over him and wide!  36 min: United are being given the run-around here. Bilbao really are a delight; they attack with such speed and numbers that at times they look capable of blowing United apart. It is a minor miracle that they are not yet level, at least. Well, maybe not a miracle: the truth is that their finishing has not been of the same level as the build-ups. Iraola offered an example just now as, with four players awaiting a pull-back, he chose to shoot from a narrow angle, allowing De Gea to fob it behind for a corner.  40 min: After withstanding more battering from Bilbao, United break forward and Rooney launches a long cross towards Hernandez, but Iraizoz intercepts with all the mean authority of a vigilant customs officer.  42 min: Fine work again by Rooney, who is the principal conduit of United&apos;s counter-attacks. But again his cross is cut out before it could reach Hernandez.  GOAL! United 1-1 Bilbao (Llorente 44&apos;) That was inevitable. And it was excellent. The highly impressive Llorente collected the ball at the edge of the area, held it up well and then shunted it wide to Suasaeta. The centreforward then darted into the area to receive the ensuing cross as Phil Jones stood and stared, and then sent an emphatic diving header past De Gea from eight yards.  Half-time: What an exhilarating half of football! Bilbao are giving United a proper seeing-to, though the hosts have also attacked with menace when given the chance. Bilbao have the away goal that complicates United&apos;s chances of progressing but they certainly do not seem inclined to settle for that and look perfectly capable of scoring a couple more tonight. You get the feeling United will have to do likewise.  David De Gea is apparently a big Metallica fan. He may, therefore, appreciate this Bilbao performance, which could only be accurately soundtracked by this (skip the ad).  Right on: &quot;Athletico come from the notoriously uncompetitive Spanish league, but even if they are playing like a lower-level High-speed Barcelona clone, they&apos;re looking every part the equal of the premiership&apos;s second best team,&quot; thunders Ben Dunn. &quot;The lesser teams in the premiership clone passion and aggression and couldn&apos;t live with this side.&quot;  46 min: United get the second half going. Ferguson presumably gave them the hairdryer treatment at half - but given that their heads were probably already spinning from the Bilbao onslaught, what good can that do? &quot;On the subject of great saves leading to goals, I seem to remember Bob Wilson saying his greatest save was in a Cup final (I think) when he tipped the goal round the post for a corner, which was promptly played in and ended up in the back of the net,&quot; recalls John davis. &quot;He still seemed to have an air of wistful bitterness forty years on, if that is possible.&quot;  47 min: More pandemonium in the United box as again Bilbao throw in as many attackers as there were defenders. After a couple of blocked shots. however, united manage to scramble it away.  49 min: Smart save from De Gea to tip away a 20-yard drive fropm Munian. Bilbao continue to batter their hosts.  51 min: Smalling strides out of defence and into the Bilbao half. But in the face of the ferocious Bilbao pressing is forced to turn around and pass the ball all the way back to De Gea.  52 min: Bilbao are threatening more quickly than I can type! Moments after they sliced United apart only for Llorente to blast wide from 10 yards, they do so again, and this time De Gea is forced into another flying save. Without him United would be on course for humiliation. They may still get there.  54 min: United are down to 10 men after Smalling walks off the pitch, seemingly injured, and Carrick gets dressed with a view to coming on. In your own time, Michael.  56 min: Some respite for United, in the form of a freekick about 25 yards from Bilbao&apos;s goal. Rooney curls a reasonable effort wide.  58 min: Two minutes without a Bilbao shot: United are improving. meanwhile, the Llorente fan club is growing: &quot;At long last a proper big lad up front who can not only head the ball into the net, but can also hold it up and knock the centre-halves over without looking clumsy,&quot; cooes Ian Burch. &quot;I thought these type of strikers were extinct. Go on big fella, put yourself about.&quot; Let&apos;s see now, if Andy Carroll is worth \u00a335m, that makes Llorente worth how much?  60 min: Suasaeta dinks in a freekick. Evans heads up in the air. It falls to a Bilbao player (not sure how) but he smashes it over the bar from 14 yards.  62 min: You have to admire United for hanging in there and continuing to use the scraps of possession to piece together dangerous moves of their own. Hernandez should have done better with a chance just now but dawdled before shooting, and Giggs then troubled the visitors with a jinking run into the box before being bustled back out of it.  64 min: San Jos\u00e9 booked for bringing down Hernandez after the Mexican and turned nimbly past him.  65 min: United substitution: Park off, Anderson on. Ferguson is trying to bolster midfield to stem the flow towards United&apos;s goal.  68 min: That would have been a brilliant goal! But again Bilbao were denied by De Gea. Muniain showed tremendous close control and trickery to beat two defenders and then exchange a neat one-two, but De Gea turned his shot out for a corner.  70 min: Carrick has made a difference to United since coming on, giving them a degree of composed steadiness in midfield. But still Bilbao look like unhingeing them every time they regain the ball.  GOAL! United 1-2 Bilbao (De Marcos 72&apos;) That&apos;s a beautiful goal, thoroughly in keeping with one of the most impressive away performances at Old Trafford in recent memory. After rapid tiki-taka around the United box, Herrera lifted the ball into the path of the in-rushing De Marcus, who swept it emphatically into the net. He may have been in an offside position when he started his run but if he was that minor injustice makes up for the injustice of Bilbao not already being in the lead before now.

But they are defending as diligently as they had been attacking and United can&apos;t get close to the danger zone. &quot;I saw Bilbao play Barca a few years ago,&quot; announces Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riain. &quot;At the time they were third in La Liga, only 25 points or so off the lead. But for the ten minutes or so Barca let them have the ball they looked really, really good. Then Barca brought Xavi on and they Bilbao never got the ball again.&quot; So what you&apos;re saying is, United should bring on, um, Danny Welbeck?  GOAL! United 1-3 Bilbao (90&apos;) That is another glorious goal! Evans and Jones colided with each other in the air, allowing De Marcos to race through and draw another save from De Gea. The goalkeeper couldn&apos;t hold it - he should have - and Rafael didn&apos;t seem aware that the ball was in his vicinity so just watched as the excellente Munian raced in at fired into the net!  GOAL! United 2-3 Bilbao (Rooney, pen, 90+2 min) Rooney sends the keeper the wrong way from the spot after De Marcos handled, giving the game a scoreline that flatters United.  Full-time: That was a bona fide thriller. Bilbao put on a performance that has seldom been equalled by an away team at Old Trafford, blowing the hosts apart. Only repeated saves by De Gea and United&apos;s characteristic refusal to buckle prevented this tie from being over. It sets up a mouth-watering return leg. On today&apos;s evidence, anyone hoping for an all-Manchester Europa League final is going to be disappointed. And anyone who thinks the Premier League is the best in the world is wrong.

The Premier League club deserved to lose clearly and in the last minute Iker Muniain scored to take Athletic&apos;s lead to 3-1 but the hosts reacted with Wayne Rooney converting a penalty. But United were outplayed for much of the Europa League tie. The side from Bilbao fell 1-0 down yet never seemed perturbed by the fact. So far as the Old Trafford atmosphere was concerned it became one of anxiety. Once Fernando Llorente had put the visitors on level terms the evening fell under the control of Marcelo Bielsa&apos;s squad. There was a reminder here that an event of this sort can be much more challenging than a Premier League encounter at this stadium. There is a hierarchy of honours and some trophies tend to be treated with disdain. In practice, though, clubs will always find themselves being seduced when they start to picture themselves landing a piece of silverware. Liverpool, for instance, did not have to fake delight when they took the Carling Cup this season. By the same token, United are unlikely to snub a prize. The trouble here was that the visitors gleamed with ambition of their own and it came as a surprise when United went ahead in the 22nd minute after a fine build-up that culminated with Ryan Giggs setting up Rooney to shoot home. All the same, that breakthrough had none of the inevitability associated with United on their own pitch. If anything, the enterprise from Athletic had been more obvious. Nor did the La Liga side get discouraged and pulled level in the 44th minute, when a patient buildup concluded with Fernando Llorente heading in after a cross by Markel Susaeta from the right of the penalty area. Once snobbery is jettisoned, tournaments all hold some kind of appeal. The Europa League is not just a chore for United, particularly when the opposition have such appetite. The side might have won readily in Amsterdam, but the return at Old Trafford saw Ajax put up a fight before being eliminated in what was ultimately a tense occasion. Athletic were hardly the sort of club who would capitulate either. They got this far after topping a group in which Paris Saint-Germain were knocked out despite the extraordinary sums poured into the French club by its Qatari owners. There was no cause for anyone in the stands or technical area at Old Trafford to be stifling a yawn over this contest. United are in a gradual transition and this sort of evening had its worth for testing their mettle. There were saves from David de Gea and all manner of blocks by his team-mates, yet United had a line-up that showed they were entirely in earnest. The selection was far from experimental even if senior figures such as Rio Ferdinand were to be found on the bench. There was sense of Sir Alex Ferguson attempting to calibrate the degree of experience that would leave the club well-placed without making undue demands of a squad whose priority is the Premier League title. It was open to question in those opening 45 minutes whether he had assessed the situation perfectly. United did have an emphasis on attack. Rooney, for instance, was in the starting line-up that included a specialist finisher in Javier Hern\u00e1ndez as well as a winger such as Ashley Young. This, in essence, was a side set up in an almost traditional 4-4-2 system. Perhaps Bilbao were deemed vulnerable, yet they are a creditable fifth in La Liga. Given the challenge of their domestic scene it seemed improbable that this fixture would disconcert them. Indeed, there was relish to their work. United were unsettled on occasion and might have had a penalty awarded against them when Chris Smalling appeared to tug Fernando Llorente in the 19th minute. The break of 15 minutes did nothing to snap the visitors&apos; concentration and United were once again compelled to scramble as they defended in a manner that looked increasing preposterous as Athletic performed with vigour and finesse. United were obliged to think primarily on defence and Chris Smalling was withdrawn. Phil Jones retreated into the back four as did Michael Carrick. The visitors may have wearied just a little and United did not hesitate to make alterations with Anderson introduced for Park Ji-sung. There was some benefit although it also appeared that Athetic had tired themselves with all that pummelling of the hosts in the opening 45 minutes. That seemed to be reflected by a booking for Mikel San Jos\u00e9 for a foul on Hern\u00e1ndez. Muniain had to be denied by De Gea before Athletic moved into a lead they fully merited. Oscar de Marcos scored after an exquisite build-up that released him. United lagged in the tie, but must have known that they had been outplayed for much of the night.", "sentences": ["The side might have won readily in Amsterdam, but the return at Old Trafford saw Ajax put up a fight before being eliminated in what was ultimately a tense occasion."], "title": "Europa League match report: Manchester United 2-3 Athletic Bilbao", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/08/manchester-united-athletic-bilbao-europa-league", "tags": ["Europa League 2011-12", "Manchester United", "Athletic Bilbao", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-10T19:59:13Z", "article": "As unprecedented security plans are drawn up to safeguard the centrepiece of the Damien Hirst show at Tate Modern, his \u00a350m diamond skull sculpture For the Love of God, the artist has revealed his hopes for a public gallery he will open in south London in 2014. &quot;It&apos;s my Saatchi gallery, basically,&quot; Hirst told the Observer, describing the development project in Lambeth that will soon display the highlights of his personal collection of more than 2,000 artworks. &quot;It&apos;s about as big as the Whitechapel \u2013 six galleries, a caf\u00e9 and a shop \u2013 and it&apos;s a place to show my collection of contemporary art. It feels bad having it all in crates. It&apos;s basically Bacon and beyond,&quot; said the artist. He added that he had five paintings by the late Francis Bacon. &quot;Which is great. He didn&apos;t make many and he&apos;s not making any more.&quot; The collection also includes works by US artist Jeff Koons, Hirst&apos;s fellow Young British Artist star Sarah Lucas, and graffiti artist, Banksy. Designed by New Art Gallery Walsall architect Caruso St John for Hirst&apos;s company Science Ltd, the gallery will be housed inside a long terrace of listed buildings, formerly used as theatre carpentry and scenery production workshops, and will be flanked by new buildings. The ground and upper floors of the listed buildings will be linked to allow the space to be used for both small and large exhibitions and the plans include office rooms for Hirst himself and a restaurant. This month the artist has also applied for permission to put his own money into building 500 new eco-homes near his house in north Devon. Hirst&apos;s infamous platinum and diamond skull, made for him with materials worth \u00a314m over 18 months by Bentley and Skinner of Bond Street, the jewellers who made the imperial state crown that is worn by the Queen for the state opening of parliament [see footnote], will be displayed for free in Tate Modern&apos;s echoing Turbine Hall from 4 April inside a special viewing room. It will be protected by the kind of security usually deployed around masterpieces such as Picasso&apos;s Guernica or a religious relic such as the Turin shroud, and uniformed guards will be stationed around the work. The skull has not been seen in this country since 2007, when it was sold to a consortium that included the artist, but it has recently drawn crowds in Florence and Amsterdam. The platinum cast of a human skull is encrusted with 8,601 pave-set diamonds weighing 1,106.18 carats, including a flawless, pink, pear-shaped diamond in the middle of the forehead. The cast&apos;s jaw is adorned with the skull&apos;s original teeth. &quot;I started thinking how, here in England, or the western world for that matter, we&apos;re obsessed with skulls and yet we avoid confronting death,&quot; the artist has explained. Although there have been Hirst retrospectives in Naples and Monaco, this will be the first solo show in a major British institution \u2013 one in which the artist swore he would never show his work. It will be, Hirst explained, &quot;a map of my life as an artist, not a greatest hits&quot;. Nevertheless the show is to include the first &quot;spot&quot; painting, the first &quot;spin&quot; painting and the first medicine cabinet, along with the controversial shark in formaldehyde and Mother and Child Divided (1993), the installation featuring a bisected cow and calf suspended in four tanks.

The coat hook falls off the wall just as Davis arrives home with Christina, a prostitute he&apos;s hired for Matt.

One of his co-defendants, Kirk Bradley, 26, from Formby, also fled from the prison van and remains wanted by Merseyside police. Six defendants, including Downes and Bradley, went on trial last May but the case was halted in its 11th week when the two men absconded during a journey from Strangeways prison.

Another man on trial, Colin Fitzgibbon, faces a retrial in June after the jury was unable to reach agreement on a charge against him.

Not just for the murderous Kony himself but for the future of activism and, potentially, for global governance. For me, the most thoughtful immediate reaction to the breakthrough success of the Invisible Children video appeal was John Naughton&apos;s article in The Observer, which wondered whether even the most viral of YouTube campaigns can really change the world? The first thing to say is that \u2013 even though I knew a fair amount about the bloody history of Uganda in general and about the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army in particular \u2013 Jason Russell&apos;s 30-minute video (yes, I watched it from beginning to end) brought it all home like a thunderclap. But the fact that it attracted something like 70 million hits in its first week and raised a reputed $5m in 48 hours helped trigger a firestorm of questioning and criticism. All of this erupted while I was in Mumbai last week \u2013 and I soon saw an interesting local trend in Twitter traffic, with growing numbers of Indians pointing out that, while the likes of Kony deserve attention, their own country still damages children on a scale that beggars belief. Since I was keynoting the first corporate responsibility summit hosted by Child Rights and You (CRY), let me just pull forward a few of their statistics. First, as context, 40% of India&apos;s population is below the age of 18 years, which at 400 million is the world&apos;s largest child population. Astonishingly, 23% of India&apos;s children are underweight at birth. Some 70 in every 1000 children born in India do not see their first birthday \u2013 and 95 in every 1000 children do not see their fifth birthday. One in every 10 children is disabled, 58% of India&apos;s children below the age of two are not fully vaccinated, and 24% do not receive any form of vaccination. More than 50% of India&apos;s children are malnourished. Less than half of India&apos;s children aged between six and 14 go to school. And so the grim statistics roll on. In our work on the Future Quotient, the ability to think about and invest in the future in an intelligent way, it is clear that India \u2013 one of my favourite countries \u2013 is falling way short when it comes to its children and young people, one of the key proxies of sustainability, with its core focus on intergenerational equity. On the upside, the story of CRY is an interesting example of what can happen when activists don&apos;t just talk (or shout) about a problem but instead plunge in to create solutions. Rippan Kapur, the airline purser who founded CRY, was &quot;an ordinary person driven by an extraordinary dream \u2013 the dream that no Indian child would be deprived of rights as basic as survival, participation, protection and development.&quot; He hated to see children begging and working as servants, but \u2013 as CRY puts it today \u2013 &quot;unlike most of us, though, he did something about it&quot;. Some 33 years ago, in 1979, he and six of his friends started CRY with 50 rupees (roughly $1 at the time) around his mother&apos;s dining table. Instead of starting a grassroots-level organisation working directly with underprivileged children, Kapur and his friends opted to make CRY a link between the millions of Indians with resources, and the thousands of dedicated individuals and organisations at the grassroots level struggling to function for lack of them. Perhaps it was no accident that the first person who truly switched me on to such problems was herself Indian and ever since I have done my best to help her. Jeroo Billimoria is the founder of Aflatoun, an extraordinary social enterprise now operating with partners in 80 countries that encourages children to save money and start social and financial microenterprises. The hope is that they will eventually break the cycle of poverty. A consummate serial entrepreneur, Jeroo is now moving to Child &amp; Youth Finance International, whose 2012 summit I am slated to speak at next month in Amsterdam. A key goal is to bring financial literacy and support to 100 million children in 100 countries by 2015. Another social enterprise in this space that we have been involved with is Lily Lapenna&apos;s MyBnk. Lily has a background in international development in Africa and Asia \u2013 and, like Jeroo, saw how a small loan can unleash entrepreneurship, improving money skills and boosting self-sufficiency. A key reason CRY was holding its event last week was to build out its links to the sort of businesses that can help in financial and other ways. My role was to help begin to bridge the gaps between the world of Cry and business, though I quickly discovered from CRY&apos;s CEO, Puja Marwaha that the group has already worked with some 100 companies. None of this is to decry the astonishing Kony 2012 campaign \u2013 indeed we must hope that it will help spotlight some of the other monsters on the international Wanted list he currently tops. But ask the question what happens when people like him are dead or in captivity, and their child soldiers and sex slaves are freed? Their futures \u2013 and those of many hundreds of millions of other invisible children worldwide \u2013 will critically depend on new forms of support and on the success of people such as Jeroo Billimoria, Lily Lapenna and Puja Marwaha. Their task will hopefully be made easier by the fact that on Monday this week Unicef, the UN Global Compact and Save the Children launched their call to business to both respect and support children&apos;s rights \u2013 linked to 10 principles ranging from child labour to advertising. As the UN&apos;s secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon puts it, &quot;When it comes to children, we all need to do more.&quot; Most of the children these campaigns will protect won&apos;t be significant consumers or investors any time soon, but companies looking for opportunities to create really significant social impact and shared value should urgently investigate this agenda. It can only become more important with time \u2013 and that&apos;s even before we factor in the children who will be impacted by today&apos;s environment-intensive lifestyles, but who are as yet unborn.

For one thing, this vast market of one billion people is busy being courted by western businesses whose own economies are contracting. But India is not just out to consume western products and lifestyles \u2013 it is looking to design as a force for change. There is much debate in India about how to live up to its growing status in the world. Design is being touted both as a tool of economic development and as a means of lifting millions of people out of poverty. So it was with great curiosity that I went to Delhi last week to take part in the India Design Forum, one of the first major conferences there on the subject. The ambition was clear from the outset. &quot;India has already unleashed its entrepreneurial ability, now it needs to unleash its creative ability. We need design,&quot; said Kamal Nath, the minister for urban development in a country with more cities of over a million people than the whole of Europe. This is the same message coming from China, as the two nations look beyond being manufacturing powerhouses and aspire to the creative capital of the west. The problem here is that &quot;design&quot;, that most expansive of disciplines, means everything from infrastructure and housing to products and branding. And in India, the frames of reference can veer wildly between the design of luxury hotels and solutions to slum housing. At the IDF, there was rather less of the latter. Instead, the main question preoccupying the local speakers was this: how can India draw on its venerable traditions to forge a distinct design identity? Design, it should be said, has not had long to thrive in India. It was only in 1991 that the country liberalised its economy and opened up to global imports. For decades prior to that, you could only buy two types of car: the Ambassador (an old Morris Oxford) and the Premier Padmini (an old Fiat). During this period, known as &quot;the licence permit quota raj&quot;, manufacturing was in the hands of a select few who operated as monopolies. After liberalisation, India started to market its goods globally, but everything looked derivative. &quot;Products were designed as if they were from everywhere and nowhere, they were acultural,&quot; says Bangalore-based graphic designer Sujata Keshavan. &quot;They couldn&apos;t look Indian because Indian products were associated with poor quality.&quot; In 1989, she co-founded Ray and Keshavan, the first company in India calling itself a design agency. Best known for designing the corporate identities of technology services giant Infosys and no less than four Indian airports, the company was so successful that it was bought by WPP, the world&apos;s largest advertising group. Yet, as Indian design agencies grow, there remains a hang-up over the issue of identity. On the one hand, this might have something to do with the fact that so much of India&apos;s cultural identity comes from its craft traditions, which do not translate naturally into a western, predominantly modernist concept of design. But numerous speakers also argued that in fact India&apos;s innate design culture is one of anonymity. The names of the architects and master craftsmen behind such masterpieces as the Red Fort in Old Delhi are rarely known. &quot;Design is perceived as a single act of genius, and that&apos;s alien to our culture,&quot; says Ambrish Arora of architecture and interiors firm Lotus. His response is to relinquish the intellectual property rights on his designs, making them all available on an open source basis. It&apos;s a marked contrast from most designers, who fight to protect their ideas from being copied, and it&apos;s exactly the kind of structural influence (rather than merely aesthetic) that India has the potential to start exercising on global design culture. Dharmalingam Udaya Kumar faced the question of identity head on when he entered a competition in 2010 to design the symbol of the rupee (only the fifth currency to get its own symbol). How do you represent a nation with 16 different languages in a way that&apos;s universally recognisable? His winning design uses a Hindi script that hangs from the line instead of sitting on it as most alphabets do, so he turned the top crossbar into the country&apos;s flag. The result not only works locally but sits comfortably next to the dollar and euro symbols. But there are also native talents that are less visible. Keshavan suggests that one of India&apos;s great strengths is in system design. This is evident not just in the efficiencies of scale achieved by manufacturers such as Tata Motors, the producer of the world&apos;s cheapest car, the Tata Nano. Take the Aravind Eye Care system, which runs surgeries 24 hours a day. The process is so streamlined that the Aravind hospitals treated 2.5 million patients in 2009 alone. Similarly, the dabbawala system in Bombay ensures that millions of home-cooked lunches are delivered in tiffins (lunch boxes) to workers across the city. There&apos;s no product, just a delivery system so effective that meals are almost never late or lost. Fashion is another sector that is strong in India, partly because the government invested in fashion education to support the huge textile industry. Indeed, the government is looking at building four new design academies, but it&apos;s not clear if or when these will materialise. Some feel the government should do more, others feel that private enterprise should step up. &quot;India needs to start thinking of manufacturing as a cultural act,&quot; says Satyendra Pakhale, an Indian product designer based in Amsterdam. It&apos;s a point well made, as that is exactly the attitude that turned Italy, another country with a fine craft heritage, into one of the world&apos;s great design cultures. &quot;There&apos;s still so little understanding of design in India,&quot; says Keshavan. &quot;Right now it&apos;s become fashionable, partly because of the market success of Apple \u2013 so &apos;design&apos; is the new buzzword.&quot; She feels that it will take time and, inevitably, education. But for me the real question that needs resolving in India is about what design is for. There was a tension at the IDF between design as a force for systemic change and &quot;design&quot; as the provider of luxury lifestyles for India&apos;s new elite. The hottest ticket in New Delhi last week was the launch of the local Architecture Digest, the magazine that specialises in the flamboyantly decorated interiors of the rich. It&apos;s not that design needs to be treated with a hair-shirted seriousness, but the sooner the conversation moves beyond the thrill of this new found glamour, the more powerful it will be.", "sentences": ["&quot;India needs to start thinking of manufacturing as a cultural act,&quot; says Satyendra Pakhale, an Indian product designer based in Amsterdam."], "title": "How will India design its new identity?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/15/india-design-identity-forum-new-delhi", "tags": ["Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "India", "Tata"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-15T18:00:02Z", "article": "Governments have a historic opportunity this June to create the institutions needed to fulfill the promise made at the 1992 Earth Summit. The Rio+20 UN conference on sustainable development should mark nothing less than a constitutional moment, putting the planet on a more sustainable path. But, it is in grave danger of being stillborn, lacking the political will to commit to the transformations required to collectively thrive within planetary boundaries. The need for action hardly needs rehearsing. To put it bluntly, humanity is demanding more of the Earth than it can supply, sending us toward tipping points beyond which the planet&apos;s air, water and other natural systems can&apos;t recover. The current structures can&apos;t cope with this new reality, as was underscored by the disappointing outcome of the recent climate change negotiations in Durban, South Africa. Despite the more than 900 environmental treaties in the past 40 years, human-induced environmental degradation continues, reaching levels that prompted the International Council for Science (ICSU) to warn last year that we have &quot;reached a point in history at which a prerequisite for development \u2013 the continued functioning of the Earth system as we know it \u2013 is at risk.&quot; While the science could not be clearer, far less systematic attention is devoted to assessing the governance reforms required. How to create a &quot;constitutional moment&quot; will be a focus of the ICSU-sponsored Planet Under Pressure conference in London later this month. There, some 3,000 experts on global change and sustainability will provide a state of the planet assessment, discuss concepts for planetary stewardship and societal and economic transformation, and prescribe a route to global sustainability. As our input into that process, we, together with 30 other leading scholars from around the world, undertook the first independent assessment of the state of environmental and sustainable development governance, with our summary findings appearing in the journal Science today. Our overarching conclusion: tinkering won&apos;t be enough. The situation requires a fundamental transformation of existing practices.. First, the largely ineffective and politically paralysed UN Commission on Sustainable Development should be replaced by a high-level council under the UN general assembly, to better handle emerging issues such as water, climate, energy and food security, natural disasters and the linkages among them, and to fully integrate environmental, economic and social sustainability goals. To be effective, the world&apos;s largest economies \u2013 the G20 - should hold 50% of the votes, with the rest distributed among smaller states. Second, environmental and social goals must be mainstreamed into the activities of all global economic institutions. This avoids the current situation where their activities undermine gains achieved by environmental treaties because of poor policy coherence. This will require meaningful high-level dialogue among economic development and environmental institutions and the same government ministers \u2013 especially of finance or treasuries \u2013 to attend such dialogues to ensure consistent national engagement at the highest levels. The UN Sustainable Development Council that we propose could host such dialogues. Third, the Nairobi-based UN Environment Programme should be elevated to a fully fledged international organisation with a status similar to the World Health Organisation \u2013 a step that would give it greater authority, more secure funding and facilitate the creation and enforcement of international regulations and standards. Such a change should not be simply symbolic, but include mobilisation of resources to properly monitor the state of the planet including socioeconomic indicators. While our proposals focus first on intergovernmental institutions, they aim to facilitate necessary transformations at the national level, where decisions must be made on how best to respond to local needs. Similarly, reforms must send more consistent signals and incentives to the private sector to engage and invest in the necessary transformation to a green economy. For example, governments must close regulatory gaps at the global level, including in the development and deployment of emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, synthetic biology, and geoengineering. Finally, the environment crisis is part of a wider set of issues; including poverty, financial and political instability, and uneven economic development. This interconnectedness increases our collective vulnerability. It makes effective earth system governance even more imperative. \u2022 Frank Biermann is chair of the Earth System Governance Project and professor of political science at the VU University Amsterdam, the Netherlands. \u2022 Steven Bernstein is professor of political science and director, master of global affairs programme at the Munk School, University of Toronto, Canada.", "sentences": ["\u2022 Frank Biermann is chair of the Earth System Governance Project and professor of political science at the VU University Amsterdam, the Netherlands."], "title": "How Rio+20 can herald a constitutional moment | Frank Biermann and Steven Bernstein", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/15/rio20-constitutional-moment", "tags": ["Rio+20 Earth summit", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Global development", "Environmental sustainability", "Sustainable development", "Environment", "Green politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-16T22:58:01Z", "article": "The staff topping up the drinks machines at the Olympic Aquatics Centre do a double take as a fresh-faced young man takes three bottles of Diet Coke and \u2013 insisting they are not all for him \u2013 promptly stuffs them into his bag. Their surprise is understandable as the young man in question is Great Britain&apos;s Olympic diving hopeful Tom Daley, thirsty after a morning&apos;s hard graft at a test event at the Olympic Park (even though he would later manage only seventh place in the final of the synchro Fina Diving World Cup). Amid the inevitable jokes about not recognising him with his clothes on, the Coca-Cola staff continue with their own training, getting to grips with the logistics of the centre that will host thousands of spectators of swimming, diving and water polo, all in a thirst-inducing temperature of 28C. When the beverage giant and Olympic sponsor was planning how it would serve soft drinks to the millions who will take part in, and watch, this summer&apos;s games, it decided the best way was to learn from past experience. At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, its workforce was 800-strong. But for London it has decided the operation should be slicker and more efficient, with those chosen better trained to cope with the eight-hour shifts and tough physical work. In a top-down hiring strategy, Malcolm Plows, the company&apos;s UK venue operations director, hand-picked 21 people from Coca-Cola&apos;s core business to take with him to the 2010 Olympic winter games in Vancouver \u2013 all have senior management roles for the forthcoming operation in the UK. &quot;We were very selective,&quot; Plows says. &quot;It was arduous because we wanted people who were absolutely passionate and committed about making the 2012 games a success. Those 21 were sent out to Vancouver to get their hands dirty.&quot; There they undertook what Coca-Cola calls &quot;activator&quot; roles \u2013 everything from filling shelves to filling coolers. Among them was Jason Burkinshaw, Coca-Cola&apos;s venue operations controller and previously national insight manager, who says: &quot;The aim was to really understand the nuts and bolts of the operation. The overriding thing we came back to the UK with, was: it&apos;s really hard, physical work, so when we did our recruitment for London, we had to drive that message home. We can&apos;t afford people arriving who then say: &apos;This is not for me&apos;.&quot; The big differences between Vancouver, Beijing and London were around space and cost and, as Plows says, a summer Olympics is five times bigger than winter. Coca-Cola will effectively be a foster parent for its 500 employees working at the park for between four and six weeks (eight if they are on duty during the paralympics, too). During that time, they will both work and sleep under the corporate umbrella, with accommodation provided at the Holiday Inn in Cromwell Road, on the other side of London, where meals and general wellbeing will be taken care of. As Plows says: &quot; We are taking 500 people from the 3,500-strong GB business to work for the Olympics at one of the busiest times of the year, July and August, when sales of soft drinks go up by at least 25%.&quot; Staff were signed up a year ago and have since undergone physical and technological training. Plows adds: &quot;As well as making them aware what jobs they are going to do, we have been trying to get them fitter. We have told them that everyone on the park is going to have to walk between 6\u201310km a day; that they are going to have to lift 100 cases a day (each containing 24 bottles and weighing 12.5kg). They will need to get themselves used to that, particularly if they have been in office jobs.&quot; Staff will be lugging a lot of heavy equipment around and shifting cases from refrigerated &quot;reefers&quot;, or containers, at key positions on the site. Not that it is just jobs for the boys; apparently women outnumber men in the final tally. All will have training in manual handling (to help them shift bulky objects) and health and safety, while extra tips on &quot;how to get fit without going to the gym&quot; have been provided by Dave Redding, head of performance science at the British Olympic Association and former England rugby fitness coach. Burkinshaw, himself no physical pushover as an &quot;iron man&quot;, says: &quot;We will have 500 people doing what more than 800 did at Beijing, so we will need to go that extra mile.&quot; The GB business will supply 325 staff, swelled by workers from future host countries. Coca-Cola&apos;s operation in Russia, where the 2014 Winter Games will be held, will send around 20. There will be a similar number from Brazil, summer host in 2016. There will also be team members from the company&apos;s activities in France, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Also in the contingent are students and 45 youngsters aged between and 18 and 21 from disadvantaged backgrounds \u2013 through Coca-Cola&apos;s collaboration with sporting charity StreetGames \u2013 and all subject to the company&apos;s &quot;one team, one T-shirt&quot; philosophy of equal treatment. At the Aquatics Centre test event, sales of drinks are already 10% up on forecasts, as I tour the venue with two of the trainees who are being deployed from elsewhere in the business. The two activators are being shown how to check the stock in the machines and carts, and how to place orders on iPads, using ground-breaking technology being used for the first time and which could save 1m pieces of paper. Plows reels off what are, indeed, Olympian-sized figures: &quot;We expect to be serving 23m drinks over the eight weeks of the Olympic and the Paralympic Games. Yet it&apos;s an operation you would never know about unless you dig a little bit deeper. It is part of the sponsorship that doesn&apos;t get very well documented.&quot; Among other mind-boggling forecasts, it is estimated that the 2,000 participating athletes will drink an average of eight to 12 soft drinks a day. The Olympic Park is expected to host 200,000 to 250,000 visitors each day with a peak of 300,000 at the start of the athletics events. Inevitably, the logistics of what is being dubbed the UK&apos;s largest peacetime catering operation are huge. Coca-Cola will be helping to quench the thirst of the athletes, their families, the Olympic workforce \u2013 including the media \u2013 as well as visitors (who will pay for their drinks). The park will house 10 enormous restaurants (including the UK&apos;s largest McDonald&apos;s) and 1,800 kiosks and concessions such as mobile carts and &quot;ambient racks&quot;, and none must run out of drinks. Coca-Cola recently at the centre of a scare in the US over the carcinogenic content of the colouring of its flagship beverage has, in the UK, been stung by criticism of its near-monopoly at the games, which means people cannot bring their own drinks into the park. Adding to the complexity of the operation is the largest range of soft drinks ever offered by the company at an Olympic Games. Plows goes on: &quot;At the last London Games [in 1948] all we offered was Coke. Now we have 17 products, including Innocent smoothies and juices. One in four will be a sugar drink, likely to be Coke, while the rest will be water, juice or non-sugar. And most drinks will be consumed on the go, or in the stadium. The staff will be working closely with the caterers and workforce managers to make sure that everybody has the chance to have a soft drink if they need it.&quot; Coca-Cola has form as a sponsor, as Plows explains: &quot;As a business, Coca-Cola has been sponsoring the Olympic Games for donkey&apos;s years \u2013 since the Amsterdam Games in 1928 \u2013 and our co-operation with each local organising committees and the IOC [International Olympics Committee] \u2013 has evolved over the years. The way we help backstage has developed as we have learned from every Games. The culmination was at Beijing, when we had more than ever \u2013 over 800 people \u2013 helping out.&quot; But back to the logistics, and Plows insists that what is provided is &quot;a very bespoke beverage service. It is unique because everything is in line with Olympic security. We will be moving about 23m servings over the Games, of which 40% is back-of-house, 60% front-of-house. &quot;Our staff will be responsible for putting all the merchandising equipment and menu boards in place. What isn&apos;t visible is the way we keep topping workforce areas and putting drinks in areas like the doping areas.&quot; By day, the staff replenishing the outlets must be sensitive to the huge crowds moving through the venues, while night deliveries must be organised via the one-way ring-road which is only open to them between 12.30am and 7am. Life for the Coca-Cola Olympic workforce is designed to mirror that of the athletes in the Olympic Village. The gruelling shift patterns and hard physical grind will be rewarded at the hotel with a dedicated lounge manned 24/7 with football games, Wii and television, where they will have fresh fruit, energy bars and soft drinks, even a massage area. Plows says: &quot;We need our staff fit, well, healthy and ready for action the next day.&quot; The majority of the staff will be between 25 and 40, and likely to end up working a six-day week, or even more: Burkinshaw recalls: &quot;In Vancouver people often worked on their day off because they had the major perk of a backstage pass.&quot; Tom Daley&apos;s surprise appearance at the drinks stand highlights the risk of staff being &quot;star struck&quot;. But Plows says: &quot;Staff are forbidden from asking for autographs and sitting in seats at any event. We have a zero tolerance policy for getting drunk or misbehaving at the hotel.&quot; During my visit, two regional Coca-Cola managers \u2013 Neville Saunderson and David Ison \u2013 were being shown the backstage areas not seen by the public, including the athletes&apos; lounge, their own warm-up area and even the long bank of hairdryers. Ison says: &quot;It&apos;s one of those things that I will probably only get to do once in a lifetime.&quot;     olympics table Photograph: Guardian  ", "sentences": ["The staff will be working closely with the caterers and workforce managers to make sure that everybody has the chance to have a soft drink if they need it.&quot; Coca-Cola has form as a sponsor, as Plows explains: &quot;As a business, Coca-Cola has been sponsoring the Olympic Games for donkey&apos;s years \u2013 since the Amsterdam Games in 1928 \u2013 and our co-operation with each local organising committees and the IOC [International Olympics Committee] \u2013 has evolved over the years."], "title": "Putting Olympic staff through their paces", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/mar/16/olympic-staff-through-paces", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-18T00:07:00Z", "article": "We are sitting in the office of Burma&apos;s chief of police in Nay Pyi Taw, the national capital of what, until a few months ago, was one of the most closed societies on Earth. Carved out of jungle and scrubland in 2005 at a reported cost of \u00a32bn, Nay Pyi Taw is the ultimate socialist vanity project, a testament to the vaulting ambitions of the secretive military junta that has ruled Burma for more than four decades. To obtain this rare audience, we have had to negotiate numerous roadblocks and armed checkpoints. Despite the recent installation of a western-friendly civilian government, I am half-expecting to be escorted to the border. Instead, we are sitting in high-backed teak chairs sipping tea with the chief of police and discussing how the countess&apos;s development agency, Association Fran\u00e7ois Xavier-Bagnoud, can help the government address the problem of human trafficking and the diseases, such as Aids, that come in its wake. I should say straight away that Albina du Boisrouvray, as she is more usually known, hates being called &quot;Countess&quot;, though clearly her title must have come in useful when dealing with the generals. For today&apos;s meeting, she is wearing a lightweight summer dress with a floral print, high heels, and large spiral earrings studded with what look like small diamonds. The jewellery appears expensive but, as Du Boisrouvray reveals later when we return to our hotel, the earrings are vintage and the &quot;diamonds&quot; are glass. The dress, meanwhile, was designed by an acquaintance. Nevertheless, Du Boisrouvray exudes Rive Gauche glamour and I am fairly sure that the chief of police and his colleagues dressed, like him, in regulation-issue blue uniforms have never seen anything quite like her. But appearances can be deceptive and none more so than in the case of Du Boisrouvray, a regular visitor to Burma who has been sharing uncomfortable truths with the junta for 20 years. Pleasantries and the ritual exchange of business cards over, it is no surprise when she launches into her spiel, about how FXB is no fly-by-night development agency but is passionately committed to fighting Burma&apos;s burgeoning Aids epidemic and working for the long-term betterment of the country and its people. FXB&apos;s philosophy, she explains, quoting the words of her intellectual mentor, Jonathan Mann, the former head of the World Health Organisation&apos;s Aids programme, is that you cannot hope to defeat an epidemic disease such as Aids without also addressing fundamental political and social issues. &quot;As Jonathan used to put it: health and human rights are inextricably linked,&quot; says Du Boisrouvray. &quot;They go hand in hand.&quot;     Albina du Boisrouvray meets Aung San Suu Kyi, who will contest elections with her National League for Democracy party in two weeks. Photograph: Kaung Htet    If the chief of police is surprised by her reference to human rights in a country notorious for summary detentions and the torture of political prisoners he doesn&apos;t show it. Instead, he smiles and tells her that he has heard many good things about FXB&apos;s Burma programmes and would welcome the opportunity to collaborate on human trafficking issues, something the Ministry of Interior recently decided should be made a political priority. &quot;But tell me,&quot; he asks, momentarily departing from the official script, &quot;what is it that first brought you to Burma?&quot; Du Boisrouvray hesitates, considering how best to respond. FXB&apos;s motto is &quot;Forgotten people, forgotten issues, in forgotten places&quot;. But in the case of Burma, that is only the beginning of the story. To understand how Du Boisrouvray came to be involved in Burma and how she has managed to keep FXB&apos;s programmes afloat during the darkest days of the junta, one has to return to Mali and the 1986 Paris-Dakar rally. It was during that race that her only son, Fran\u00e7ois, plunged to his death while flying a rescue helicopter over the desert. Aged 24, Fran\u00e7ois had been flying helicopters for his father Bruno Bagnoud&apos;s alpine rescue company, Air-Glaciers, since the age of 11 and was a highly experienced pilot, which is why Thierry Sabine, the rally organiser, had picked him to man his dual-control Ecureuil helicopter. No one knows exactly what happened, but it appears that after being forced to land in a sandstorm in Mali at night, Bagnoud took off again, only to crash into a dune some 20 miles short of his destination. By the time Du Boisrouvray reached the crash site, it had been thoroughly picked over by Tuareg nomads, but from the skid marks she and her husband guessed the helicopter must have suddenly lost power and flipped over as Fran\u00e7ois attempted a soft landing. Besides Bagnoud and Sabine, there were three other passengers, including the singer-songwriter Daniel Balavoine. No one survived.     A doctor checks drugs at an FXB clinic. Photograph: Kaung Htet    Du Boisrouvray, then a film producer with little interest in health and development issues, was devastated. Her response was to abandon film \u2013 in a career spanning 17 years she produced 16 features, including the 1984 desert war romance, Fort Saganne, starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu \u2013 and set up a foundation in her son&apos;s name. In 1989, she auctioned her jewellery and art collection, as well as a substantial slice of her father&apos;s real estate business, at Sotheby&apos;s in New York and put $100m into FXB. One of her first acts was to join forces with M\u00e9decins du Monde and lobby the United Nations to adopt the Convention on the Rights of the Child. To persuade countries to ratify the convention, Du Boisrouvray joined 15 destitute children on a voyage retracing the routes of African slavers. The voyage opened her eyes to the plight of vulnerable children, an issue close to her son&apos;s heart. It also coincided with growing concerns about the worldwide spread of HIV and Jonathan Mann&apos;s warning that the Aids epidemic was creating thousands of orphans, many of them infected with HIV. &quot;That was something no one had thought very much about at the time,&quot; says Du Boisrouvray. &quot;I thought, this is where FXB can really make a difference.&quot; To make the best of FXB&apos;s limited resources, she decided to channel aid specifically to children already infected with HIV. At the same time, she began supporting the extended families and communities caring for those children by setting up &quot;FXB villages&quot; offering everything from medical and psychosocial care to educational training and microfinance initiatives. The result is a network of more than 100 programmes in 15 countries, including South Africa, Uganda, Colombia and Thailand, with 450 employees and more than 1,000 volunteers. While bigger NGOs such as Save the Children may be better funded, FXB aims to punch above its weight by fostering deep relationships in the countries where it operates and committing to women and children for the long term. Du Boisrouvray is also fearless when it comes to making the connection between health and human rights. Indeed, one of the most remarkable aspects of her story is that it was her concern for the plight of sex workers who were being trafficked across the Burmese border to Thailand and her determination to repatriate the survivors, many of whom had been infected with HIV, that first forced the generals to confront the truth about the Aids epidemic in Burma and their responsibility for the ravages it was inflicting. &quot;When I came here in 1992 the generals knew nothing about Aids,&quot; she explains when I first meet her in Rangoon on a sweltering night in February. &quot;In the beginning, I think their primary concern was for the military and for their own families. But bit by bit they have opened up.&quot;     The Sunday Empowerment Group at the FXB vocational training centre in Shwepyitha, north of Rangoon, offers support to HIV positive men and women, information about safe sex and free condoms.

The fan-cooled verandas and verdant gardens are awash with returning expats and businessmen hungry to ink deals before the expected lifting of western sanctions in April. You can tell how much Burma has changed in the last year simply by the number of laptops and iPads open at adjoining tables. Prior to the installation of a civilian-led government in March 2011, access to the internet was strictly controlled and dissidents faced arrest and detention for posting blogs critical of the regime. Now former &quot;enemies of the state&quot;, such as Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy (NLD) leader who spent a total of 15 years under house arrest in Rangoon, are allowed to campaign openly for parliament and foreign journalists are increasingly free to ask uncomfortable questions, though the Burmese press is still subject to close censorship. &quot;I never thought this day would come,&quot; says Du Boisrouvray. &quot;It&apos;s wonderful to see this opening up. Let&apos;s just hope Burma doesn&apos;t go the way of its neighbours and surrender to consumerism.&quot; In the autumn of 1992, when Du Boisrouvray arrived in Rangoon for the first time, it was a different world: &quot;No taxis, no street lights, everything plunged in darkness.&quot; There had been parliamentary elections two years earlier but, although the NLD had won a resounding majority, the military had not allowed parliament to convene. Instead, General Ne Win, the leader of the 1962 coup d&apos;etat, ruled Burma as a nominally socialist republic, pursuing a ruinous policy of economic isolation while rigging the constitution to ensure the military would always command a parliamentary majority. It had taken several months for Du Boisrouvray to arrange a visa. Her representations were not helped by the fact that earlier that summer, at the 1992 international Aids conference in Amsterdam, she had accused the junta of complicity in the murder of eight prostitutes. The previous year, with the help of a group of activist Thai lawyers, FXB and M\u00e9decins du Monde had rescued eight underage Burmese sex workers, as well as girls of other nationalities, from a brothel in Chiang Mai in Thailand. But while the Chinese and Laotians had been repatriated, the Burmese girls never made it home. Instead, Du Boisrouvray was told their bodies had been seen floating in a river on the Thai-Burmese border. Her assumption was that they had been murdered by Burmese border guards. &quot;I was screaming, &apos;I&apos;ve got to know what happened to these girls because it&apos;s rumoured they&apos;ve been killed because they were HIV positive.&apos; I told the delegates, &apos;You&apos;re talking about the prostitution of underage children but I&apos;ve got a precise case; won&apos;t you help me to do something about it?&apos;&quot; By now, Du Boisrouvray had also discovered other girls being trafficked to brothels in Ranong in western Thailand near the south tip of Burma. Incensed, she informed her friend Saisuree Chutikul, a Thai cabinet minister, who in turn instructed the Thai police to raid the brothels. They rounded up 270 women, including 95 Burmese, half of whom were HIV positive. It was Du Boisrouvray&apos;s determination to make sure they did not suffer the same fate as the other women and that they would receive access to medicines and psychosocial support in their home country that convinced her to go to Burma. Not surprisingly, at first the generals were unwelcoming and refused to grant her a visa. But eventually, after she called on her contacts at the French embassy and Burmese medics sympathetic to her cause, the regime relented. To this day, Du Boisrouvray does not know precisely what prompted their change of heart but, given her later discovery that the girls were most likely murdered by Thais, not the Burmese, she has a theory. &quot;I think it was because I was accusing them of a crime they hadn&apos;t committed and they wanted to prove they were the good guys. Also, at the time they knew next to nothing about Aids and were worried what the epidemic could mean for their families, so I was a kind of safe way for them to get information from the wider world.&quot; It was the beginning of a 20-year relationship with Burma that would see Du Boisrouvray forge close ties with some of the most senior members of the regime and found programmes that continue to pay dividends to this day. To get an idea of how FXB has made a difference to the lives of women and children in Burma infected with HIV, I journeyed with Du Boisrouvray and her Burma country director, Kathy Shein, to an FXB vocational training centre in Shwepyitha, a sprawling township north of Rangoon. There, on a tropical Sunday afternoon as the mercury nudged 40C, I was shown around workshops equipped with spindles and looms where women are trained in weaving fabrics and manufacturing bags and soft toys for local shops and markets. The centre also has a medical centre, where patients can get regular check-ups and advice on taking antiretroviral medications, as well as a kindergarten where orphans are taught the rudiments of reading and writing. However, the heart of the centre is its Sunday Empowerment Group where women and men gather to support one another while FXB staffers distribute condoms and reinforce messages about safe sex. Living with HIV is never easy, Du Boisrouvray explains, but in Burma where stigmatisation is widespread and people still believe the virus can be transmitted by touch, it is doubly hard. These challenges are brought home to me by one of the 95 sex workers repatriated to Burma 20 years ago by Du Boisrouvray. Toe Toe, now aged 44 and the centre&apos;s head seamstress, says she never intended to become a sex worker but was sold into slavery by a &quot;friend&quot; of the family who had told her he would arrange safe passage to Bangkok where she would work in a fruit market. Instead, after enduring a four-day journey in an open boat in the Andaman Sea, she was taken to Charlie&apos;s Inn, a seedy fisherman&apos;s bar and brothel in Ranong. There, she was beaten repeatedly until she agreed to have sex with clients. It was only when the Thai police raided the brothel several months later that Toe Toe realised she had not been in Bangkok after all. But by then, of course, it was too late: she had contracted HIV. Even today, Toe Toe is reluctant to speak about her ordeal. She explains that when neighbours discovered she was taking medications for Aids they shunned her, driving her from her village. It is only when Du Boisrouvray arrives, prompting a flood of tears followed by much hugging, that Toe Toe agrees to tell me her story. She is not the only victim. Sitting beside her are Marwei, 48, who was also sold to a sex ring by &quot;friends&quot; and ended up in another brothel in Ranong, and Zar Ni, the only woman who admits trading sex for money willingly. Caught up in the same Thai police raid, all three were taken to a women&apos;s shelter in Bangkok. To this day, they will never forget the moment Du Boisrouvray walked in and shared a meal with them. &quot;You were so beautiful, so young,&quot; Toe Toe tells her. &quot;We thought you were an angel. Do you remember how at the end we all stood up and applauded you?&quot; It is a testament to FXB&apos;s advocacy \u2013 among its other duties, FXB helps secure antiretroviral medications for women and children enrolled in its programmes \u2013 that of the 50 who tested positive for HIV in 1992, half are still alive. One of those who did not make it is the mother of Kyaw Shan. Now aged 13, he lives with his father in a monastery and has a permanent air of sadness. Like many orphans of the epidemic, he is himself HIV positive. The only moment he smiles is when he is embraced by an 18-year-old volunteer called Yie Tone. Yie Tone, I notice, wears her hair short and dresses like a boy. It is only later that I learn her mother died of HIV when she was 12 and that soon after her stepsister tried to sell her to a sex ring. Luckily, she was able to seek sanctuary with FXB. Her dream now is to become a human rights lawyer. If it was Toe Toe and her co-workers who first brought Du Boisrouvray to Burma, it is for Kyaw Shan, Yie Tone and all the other invisible victims of the epidemic that she has continued working with the regime. It hasn&apos;t been easy. In 1996, for instance, she was banned from entering the country after writing a critical article in the New York Times. In 2003, with the accession to the prime minister&apos;s office of Khin Nyunt, who despite being the then chief of military intelligence was considered a moderate, she was allowed to return, but a year later Khin Nyunt was deposed by conservative elements in the junta and access again became difficult. Despite whoever has been in power, however, Du Boisrouvray says she has always been able to find people sympathetic to her cause and to this day she is on first-name terms with two former health ministers. In the past, she would never have visited Nay Pyi Taw, not because the trip would have been hard to arrange but, she says, because in those days she did not want to be seen to be supporting the regime. Now that things appear to be opening up, she feels the generals deserve to be given the benefit of the doubt &quot;This is not a time to criticise the junta,&quot; she says. &quot;Instead, let&apos;s support them and see how far they are prepared to take the reforms.&quot; Although the press is still subject to censorship, more and more stories are being passed and those who can afford internet charges no longer find access to the BBC and dissident news sites blocked. The next test is the parliamentary elections in two weeks. While there are 48 seats up for grabs on 1 April the vote is not expected to alter the balance of power because under the constitution the military is entitled to a quarter of the seats in the lower house and the remainder are dominated by the main pro-military party. That is why veteran Burma watchers believe the real test will come later this year when the NLD and other independent parties begin to flex their muscles and demand changes to the constitution. No matter who takes power the country faces big challenges. Although the incidence of HIV in Burma is lower than in many parts of Africa, the UN estimates there are currently some 120,000 Burmese living with HIV, of whom only a third are receiving antiretroviral drugs, leaving some 80,000 without access to vital medications. To make matters worse, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is rampant, greatly complicating treatment protocols. The crisis can be clearly seen at the M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res drop-in clinic in northern Rangoon where doctors only have the capacity to treat the most critical cases. Everyone else is simply turned away. &quot;It&apos;s very demoralising,&quot; says Peter Paul de Groote, MSF Burma&apos;s head of mission. &quot;In some cases, we are talking about people with full-blown Aids. It&apos;s like the 1980s all over again.&quot; The tragedy is that with annual spending on health at the equivalent of 50 cents per person \u2013 one of the lowest in the world \u2013 Burma does not have the capacity to close the treatment gap, and with the next funding round of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria currently suspended there seems little prospect of western donors making up the shortfall in the near future. All the more reason, says Du Boisrouvray, why she is determined to remain in Burma and continue working with the regime. &quot;Toe Toe knows that theoretically she should have died a long time ago in that brothel. The tragedy is she is still dependent on us for medicines and support and the same is true for many of the other women. FXB is their family. To abandon them now would be the biggest crime of all.&quot; If you wish to make a donation or support FXB&apos;s work please go to www.fxb.org", "sentences": ["Her representations were not helped by the fact that earlier that summer, at the 1992 international Aids conference in Amsterdam, she had accused the junta of complicity in the murder of eight prostitutes."], "title": "How a determined French countess helps Burma's Aids orphans", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/18/burma-fxb-aids-charity-trafficking-boisrouvray", "tags": ["Human trafficking", "Charities", "Aung San Suu Kyi", "World news", "Law", "Society", "Voluntary sector", "Aids and HIV", "Myanmar"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-19T13:37:44Z", "article": "     David Cameron set the scene yesterday for battles with Tory traditionalists and Liberal Democrats by pledging to take bold action to build up Britain&apos;s infrastructure. In a sign of No 10&apos;s anxiety over accusations that it has struggled to promote growth, the prime minister pledged to tackle a &quot;failure of nerve&quot; by holding a consultation on whether to build a Thames estuary airport and to reform &quot;bureaucratic&quot; planning laws. The consultation on a &quot;Boris Island&quot; airport, which is a victory for Boris Johnson, the London mayor, raises the prospect of a general election clash between the Tories and Liberal Democrats in the south-east. The Lib Dems are standing by their general election manifesto pledge in which they said they would oppose &quot;any expansion&quot; of airports in the south-east. The prime minister is allowed under the terms of the coalition agreement to hold the consultation because the Tories and Lib Dems agreed only to rule out expansion of existing airports. The Tories could go into the next election with a commitment to build a new airport, though sources stressed that the prime minister had an open mind. In his speech, the prime minister cited the consultation as an example of his bold thinking on building up Britain&apos;s infrastructure. &quot;We need to retain our status as a key global hub for air travel. Not just a feeder route to bigger airports elsewhere, in Frankfurt, Amsterdam or Dubai. Yes, this will be controversial. We will need to take decisions for the long term.&quot; He also confirmed that he would publish a new national planning policy framework that would lead to the biggest simplification in 60 years of &quot;bureaucratic, top-down planning laws&quot;. The National Trust and the Daily Telegraph have been running a campaign against the planning reforms on the grounds that they will undermine the green belt. Cameron said: &quot;We must get our planning system fit for purpose. It needs to be quick. It needs to be easier to use. And it needs to better support growth, jobs and homes.&quot; Cameron set out his plans to rejuvenate Britain&apos;s infrastructure in a speech at the Institution of Civil Engineers in which he confirmed that the government was looking to invite sovereign wealth funds to lease trunk roads and motorways in England. This would be modelled on the funding system for water mains and sewerage, which has led to improvements. But Cameron insisted no tolls would be introduced on existing capacity. &quot;This is not about mass tolling \u2013 and as I&apos;ve said, we&apos;re not tolling existing roads,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s about getting more out of the money that motorists already pay.&quot; He said the time had arrived to strengthen and rebuild Britain&apos;s infrastructure as he invoked the memory of Victorian pioneers. &quot;We are falling behind our competitors,&quot; he said. &quot;And falling behind the great, world-beating, pioneering tradition set by those who came before us. There is now an urgent need to repair the decades-long degradation of our national infrastructure and to build for the future with as much confidence and ambition as the Victorians once did. &quot;Our national heroes include men of iron and steam like Brunel, Stephenson and Telford \u2013 all commemorated in Westminster Abbey alongside former prime ministers and great authors like Charles Dickens. Our inheritance includes daring bridges and soaring stations \u2013 structures built with Victorian swagger and intended to last like Norman castles.&quot; The prime minister promised to &quot;blast through the vested interests and bureaucratic hurdles&quot; as he said he would: \u2022 Work with the private sector to replace Britain&apos;s nine nuclear power plants, which are due to come to the end of their lives between now and 2030. There will be no state subsidy. \u2022 Ensure that 90% of properties have access to high-speed broadband by 2015. The remaining &quot;hard-to-reach&quot; properties will have at least &quot;functional broadband&quot; of two megabits per second. George Osborne, the chancellor, will announce 10 &quot;superconnected cities&quot; with access to 100Mb broadband. \u2022 Auction the 4G network to ensure that it covers 99% of the population. The prime minister said he was braced for protests. &quot;I&apos;m not dogmatic about this. There will be costs and protests. And I am certainly not doing it in the hope of immediate political advantage. I can see the furious objections \u2013 the banner headlines \u2013 already.&quot;But rather than give in we should ask instead: what is it that people want for the future? Reasonable things. A decent home. A clean environment. Jobs for their children. The ability to get around without hassle, huge costs or endless jams. And then we should take the necessary steps to make these things a reality, not leave future generations to deal with the consequences of our cowardice.&quot;", "sentences": ["Not just a feeder route to bigger airports elsewhere, in Frankfurt, Amsterdam or Dubai."], "title": "Cameron faces battles on two fronts over infrastructure plans", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/19/cameron-plan-improve-britain-infrastructure", "tags": ["David Cameron", "Transport policy", "Budget 2012", "Budget", "UK news", "Politics", "Transport", "Road transport", "Air transport", "World news", "Planning policy", "Environment", "Travel and transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-23T11:43:00Z", "article": "For two days last weekend, Belgrade played host to the inaugural Resonate festival, a new media event gathering together artists, programmers, and assorted types from the creative and technology industries. Trading insights - often late into the night - were code artists, designers (graphic, interaction and otherwise), film-makers, programmers of all persuasions, visualization folk, creative technologists, and others - all brought together by the vision of Maria Jelesijevi\u0107, a Belgrade-based visual artist, and Filip Visnjic, editor-in-chief of the Creative Applications Network. As indicative as anything of the nature of Resonate was the frequency with which speakers began talks with gambits like: &quot;I&apos;m not really sure how to introduce myself, because my work kind of...falls in between categories.&quot; Jer Thorp, data artist in residence at the New York Times, had a humble take on this when he said he often felt in a position of &apos;extreme mediocrity&apos; when it came to the practice of any one of the skills involved in his work. Audiences were taken on journeys, from discipline X to Y, sometimes detouring into Z, by professionals whose entire modus has been to work in the gaps between. An enormous and hugely varied body of work was presented of which I can only begin to give a taste. J\u00fcrg Lehni spoke about Paper.js, on open-source, vector graphics scripting framework running on top of HTML 5 canvas that he developed with his partner Jonathan Puckey, an Amsterdam-based designer. He also spoke about his other work, not least his now well-known drawing machine &apos;Hector&apos;, which uses a script - and a series of pulleys, levers and string - to program the movements, and sprays, of a can of paint. Josh Nimoy, a West Coast-based code artist, talked the crowd through some 30 years of art production, from his earliest paintings as a kid, through the stunning visuals he produced alongside Bradley Munkowitz for the recent Tron film. He also gave one of the more memorable descriptions of the thing clients seemed to want when they asked for his fancy visuals, namely: &quot;Sexy bullshit.&quot; Jonathan Puckey presented the &apos;Conditional Design manifesto&apos;, an attempt to define an approach to design - regardless of &apos;chosen media&apos; - as a reaction to a world where computation, or computational processes, are increasingly prevalent. (One of the principles is a questioning of the use of random functions: &apos;Avoid arbitrary randomness. Difference should have a reason.&apos;) Jer Thorp gave an introduction to Open Paths, a place where users can upload, securely store and make use of personal location information gathered by their mobile devices. It was designed, he said, to return to users the power to understand and use their data in a world where that data is largely collected for the exclusive use of corporations. Separate to the talks were a suite of workshops where participants got a more &apos;hands-on&apos; experience of various technologies.     The \"RGB+Depth\" framework combines a Kinect device with a high-definition camera    One of the best-attended was one about a new framework called &apos;RGB+Depth&apos;, where a Kinect device is attached to a high-definition camera, thereby adding a depth component to filming. This generated a lot of attention. Film-makers, such as the Berlin-based Gabriel Shalom recognised the potential of a world where, instead of just frames, what directors are effectively capturing in shooting is a &apos;point cloud&apos;, enabling them to experiment with the creation of &apos;virtual cameras&apos; in post-production. Other workshops talked participants through the use of libraries to assist computational design tasks (Karsten Schmidt), programming visual effects (by Andreas Mueller, of Nanika), digital stereoscoping (Richard Difford and Anne-Laure Guiot), and, popularly, Niklas Roy&apos;s beguiling &apos;Electronic Instant Camera&apos;. Great festivals don&apos;t have &apos;themes&apos; - the best assemble interested folk and hopefully allow them to exchange ideas. (Big tick to Resonate on that front.) But if there was a motif that ran through the festival - whether in the talks, workshops, or interstitial conversations, it was this: that if this is an age when computation affects pretty much everything - not least design, then there seems to be a strong theme emerging around how &apos;a human element&apos; can join in that affectation. This can often manifest itself as a concern for instances where humanity is absent, as evidenced by Jer Thorp&apos;s quote (in a data context) that &quot;we&apos;ve ignored the human context of systems&quot;, and J\u00fcrg Lehni&apos;s (in a software tool context) that &quot;there is great promise in combining manual and combinatorial ways of work.&quot; There was a simultaneous recognition that computers have given rise to different kinds of human behaviour, often in unexpected ways. Field, for instance, a London-based agency, remarked that &quot;by adding features to a system, you create possibilities&quot;, citing the example of a new style of make-up  - consisting of large, black and white triangles on the cheeks - which allows the wearer to avoid detection by facial recognition systems. Overall, a brilliant and inspiring event.

Paintings by John William Waterhouse, William Holman Hunt and GF Watts are among 23 being lent to an exhibition in Leighton House Museum, Kensington, by Sydney businessman John Schaeffer. Many of the works, which include a Holman Hunt to be exhibited at the Tate Britain&apos;s Pre-Raphaelite show this autumn, have not been seen since the early 20th century. Schaeffer was born in Amsterdam and migrated to Australia in the 1950s as a virtually penniless ship&apos;s steward who knew little of the art world. He eventually saved enough to acquire a cleaning business, transforming Tempo Services from a firm employing 25 people into a plc with a staff of 23,000. He told the Observer: &quot;It was the early dawn of outsourcing. Within a few years, just about every organisation would no longer think of doing its own cleaning, but would give it to a contractor. The little company I bought flourished\u2026 [becoming] one of the top 20 companies in Australia.&quot; Visiting the Tate&apos;s 1984 Pre-Raphaelite exhibition was a life-changing moment, he said. &quot;It galvanised my collecting. The whole exhibition struck me \u2026 the poetry, the storylines, the romanticism. As a businessman who didn&apos;t have any formal training, it \u2026 caused me to suddenly pick up books and feverishly read [about] what inspired the artists.&quot; His fascination was further boosted by a visit to Leighton House, the exotic former home and studio of the Victorian artist Lord Frederic Leighton. Schaeffer said: &quot;Of all the Victorian artists, I found him to be the king on the top of the mountain.&quot; Yet in the 1950s and 1960s, at a time when high Victorian art was deeply unfashionable for collectors, British public collections sold off masterpieces that would today be worth millions. By the time Schaeffer began collecting in the 1980s, they had begun &quot;scaling up in price&quot;. Even so, paintings that he could then buy for \u00a3100,000 would now cost a million, he said. His loans to Leighton House will include Lord Leighton&apos;s Flaming June, a tender depiction of a woman curled up asleep, one of the most famous of all Victorian paintings. Schaeffer spoke of being seduced by its &quot;sheer beauty&quot;. Other loans include The Birth of Eve, a spectacular painting with lifesize figures painted by Solomon J Solomon. Daniel Robbins, senior curator at Leighton House, said that it was &quot;somewhat controversially sold off&quot; by Ealing council in the 1940s: &quot;Now the canvas is returning for the first time.&quot; Pre-Raphaelite and 19th-Century Art from the John Schaeffer Collection will be at Leighton House, London W14, from 26 April-23 September.

In the weeks leading up to the Guardian&apos;s Open Weekend, we invited readers to submit their own questions for the artist. The responses were, by definition, unrepresentative and unscientific. But what a revelation they were. My usual preparation for an interview had seemed so self evident until as to merit little attention. Whoever the interviewee, when drawing up questions I almost always gravitate towards their fault-lines and conflicts \u2013 the paradoxes and puzzles in their life and work. But our readers, it soon transpired, had other ideas. Starting from a broad position of admiration, most of their questions could be characterised as devices to illuminate Perry&apos;s personality, or invitations to expand on his relationship with his work. It came as quite a shock to realise that only one of all their questions would have featured on my list. Conversely, lots of them posed a fantastical scenario, based on a hypothesis \u2013 for example: &quot;If you could travel back in time ...&quot; \u2013 which would never have even crossed my mind. The conclusion was rather sobering. If these questions were representative of what readers actually found interesting, it might be time for a radical rethink. To be fair, though, no research method would have generated my single favourite question, submitted by the artist&apos;s wife, who tweeted: &quot;What&apos;s for dinner?&quot; Perry is one of the few people I&apos;ve met who actually go, &quot;Ha ha ha,&quot; when they laugh \u2013 as he does, with earthy abandon, when I read out her question, before pointing out: &quot;Well she&apos;d know the answer to that.&quot; Resplendent in a baby-doll dress of appliqu\u00e9 satin, and pantomime dame make up, he adds, deadpan, &quot;I&apos;m an old-fashioned man. As you can see.&quot; Perry must be about as close to the perfect interviewee as one could hope for. He dresses for the occasion, and deploys the risque, occasionally catty candour of the underdog outsider. He likes to preface a reply with a quote, and the breadth of his erudition is almost as impressive as his gift for counter intuitive aphorisms: &quot;Innovation,&quot; he declares, for example, &quot;is overrated.&quot; If Perry were a politician, these could easily be dismissed as sound-bites. But he commands the sort of giddy affection we tend only to bestow on our most improbable heroes. The artist became a household name more or less overnight, when he surprised the art world by winning the 2003 Turner prize. Perry had already been working as an artist for the best part of 20 years by then, but wasn&apos;t particularly well known within art circles, let alone to the public at large. Born and brought up in Essex, he&apos;d endured a fairly miserable childhood and escaped to London, via art school, as soon as he could. Never fashionable, his success as an artist had been respectable but unremarkable \u2013 until the Turner prize made him a star. Perhaps the clearest single theme to emerge from readers&apos; questions was their impression that the contemporary art world \u2013 embodied by Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin and so on \u2013 is a bit cynical, whereas Perry represents wholesome integrity. Interestingly, although Perry comes across as something of a mischief-maker, his answers are deceptively skilful, managing to both confirm the audience&apos;s distinction between himself and the Young British Artists (YBAs) \u2013 and yet never endorsing any explicit criticism of his glitzier contemporaries&apos; work. &quot;Contemporary art has become this baggy old bag; you can dump any old thing in and people say it&apos;s art,&quot; he will concede. &quot;I don&apos;t want to see something you could think up in the bath and just phone it in. If you go to the Tate, every scrap of paper, every piece of poo \u2013 literally \u2013 is only made significant because it has a famous name attached. As an artist I&apos;m very aware of what I call Picasso-napkin syndrome \u2013 I&apos;ve got this 20th century version of the midas touch, where if I do a little doodle it&apos;s worth money! And that&apos;s quite a weird and horrifying curse, if you&apos;re in the creative business, because you become incredibly self conscious.&quot; Perry has the audience in giggles when he observes: &quot;Now that conceptual art has appeared on the Archers, you know that the game is up,&quot; and reflects, &quot;The most interesting thing about Damien Hirst is probably his accounts. Not to say that his work isn&apos;t interesting as well,&quot; he adds quickly. &quot;But the most interesting thing is probably the accounts.&quot; He calls biennales &quot;banalies&quot;, and says the modern gallery-goer&apos;s attitude to contemporary art &quot;is theme park plus sodoku. They want to go, &apos;My god it&apos;s so sexy, shocking, big, shiny, amazing!&apos; But,&quot; and he starts to mime chin-stroking introspection, &quot;&apos;what&apos;s it about, what&apos;s it about?&apos; My attitude to art is: is it good art? Is it giving me visual pleasure?&quot; He thinks art whose sole purpose is to shock is &quot;a bit boring. It&apos;s a bit lame,&quot; and though he sees a place for shock in art \u2013 &quot;I suppose there&apos;s an element that, you know, you need salt on your potatoes; I think it&apos;s part of the kind of excited tingle of looking at an art work,&quot; he thinks it&apos;s become &quot;a kind of worn-out thing&quot;. All of which goes down wonderfully with his audience. But he is very careful to steer clear of anything that could be construed as an art-world cat-fight. &quot;I think the prank, if you like, of just signing a piece of paper and saying that&apos;s art \u2013 that&apos;s great, and it kind of had to be done, you know, make that boundary of what art can be,&quot; he offers diplomatically. A reader&apos;s question\u2013 &quot;Compared with Grayson Perry, most of the YBAs of the 90s were, and are, humourless self-important pretentious bores. Discuss,&quot; \u2013 makes him laugh raucously, but he replies, &quot;Well I know quite a lot of them and they&apos;re very funny, so that&apos;s a very sweeping, terrible bitter generalisation \u2013 probably,&quot; Perry grins, &quot;from a failed artist.&quot; Another question \u2013 &quot;Given that much of the YBAs success could be attributed to their having gone to college with Damien Hirst, what would you identify as your own lucky break?&quot; is jokily dismissed as clearly from &quot;another bitter artist&quot;. And yet his answer is intriguing. A member of staff at an Amsterdam gallery, Perry recalls, came across one of his pots while rummaging through the basement for a ceramic show. She called him, got to know him, and asked if he&apos;d like to exhibit a show in their gallery. That show won Grayson the Turner Prize in 2003: &quot;So I guess that was my lucky break.&quot; Over the years since then, Perry&apos;s work has increasingly featured his childhood teddy bear, called Alan Measles; he recently toured Bavaria on a motorbike, with Alan balanced on the back in his own custom built glass shrine, and he plays with the idea of Alan as a god. The bear is almost as famous as Perry by now, and a reader wants to know who Perry prefers \u2013 himself, or his bear? &quot;Oh well it depends. If I&apos;m going to play the game then of course Alan is my deity and I owe everything to him. Therefore I would say that he is the senior partner. But of course I&apos;m afraid to say that I projected everything onto him, so I&apos;m sorry Alan but he owes everything to me. I have invented him. I hate to tell this to people but most gods were invented by someone. I&apos;m sorry. It&apos;s just that I&apos;m in the present, whereas the famous gods were invented by someone a long time ago.&quot; An audience member asks if he is serious about regarding Alan as a god, or merely being satirical, and Perry admits that at first the idea was a joke, but over time has evolved into &quot;a serious look at how religions form.&quot; The best religions, he adds, &quot;develop organically. On Twitter, probably.&quot; Alan Measles may or may not be a God, but he is unquestionably a celebrity \u2013 as is Perry \u2013 and many questions explore the theme of the artist as a personality. Perry handles them all with the unflappable poise of a media veteran. &quot;Well one of the first things a journalist asked me after I won the Turner prize was, are you a loveable character or are you a serious artist? And I kind of replied, is it an either or? We live in a media saturated world. I&apos;m sure artists of the past would have dealt with it in just the same way. If you&apos;re in the business of communication and images, then if you ignore the media-sphere you&apos;re just cutting off your own foot. It&apos;s just daft.&quot; He is equally pragmatic about the relationship between contemporary art and finance. His 2009 work, Walthamstow Tapestry, satirised our slavish devotion to brands \u2013 and yet his recent exhibition at the British Museum was sponsored by the luxury brand Louis Vutton, as well as a City firm, Alix Partners. The only question I would have asked myself came from a reader who felt troubled by this partnership, and suggested that artists should be chronicling the wealthy&apos;s abuses, not rubbing up to them, but wondered if they could no longer afford to bite the hand that feeds. &quot;Well,&quot; Perry responds equably, &quot;Nam June Paik said an artist should always bite the hand that feeds him \u2013 but not too hard. It&apos;s one of my favourite quotes, that one. My show wouldn&apos;t have happened without a sponsor, full stop. It&apos;s just \u2013 you have to chew on it, it&apos;s a real thing. It&apos;s not a kind of new thing.&quot; He is similarly pragmatic about becoming a brand. &quot;Well it&apos;s interesting because we use the word brand in a very derogatory way a lot of the time. I do it as much as anyone. But i think a brand is also sort of like momentum; it gets you through the bad patches if you&apos;ve got a good brand.&quot; He adds, though, &quot;As an artist I&apos;m extremely aware, increasingly, that everything that comes out of the studio I have to feel it&apos;s of the correct quality. I can&apos;t just sit on my brand at all. I think the worst behaviour of brands is when they&apos;re all brand and no quality.&quot; Perry spent six years in therapy, from the late 90s to early 2000s, and is married to a psychotherapist, so many questions come up about the relationship between art and therapy. &quot;Therapy&apos;s been a huge influence,&quot; he says, &quot;and, yes, being married to a therapist has been amazingly influential because we talk all the time about therapy issues and I think it&apos;s a very clear eyed way of looking at the world. I look at my art during the time I was in therapy and it was a kind of flowering; I got into top gear at that point.&quot; In fact he came to the end of therapy the year after winning the Turner prize, so I ask if he thinks this was coincidental or connected. &quot;Yeah, if you do therapy you&apos;ll win the Turner prize,&quot; he jokes. Therapy had a major impact on Perry&apos;s transvestism, which began in childhood and quickly became a compulsion, but sounds like a pure pleasure for Perry today. He used to talk about dressing up as an alter ego called Claire, but therapy taught him to reconcile his two gender identities, and the construct of a female self called Claire now feels to him like a bit of anachronism. Perry goes along with the Claire shtick as far as he can, but it&apos;s evident that his patience is wearing thin. I put a question from a reader who says that, when dressed as Claire, Perry is &quot;the spitting image of my mother in law&quot;. Perry&apos;s timing and deadpan delivery are faultless: &quot;Well, he&apos;s got a very interesting mother-in-law.&quot; Asked where he shops, he says he doesn&apos;t; his clothes are all custom-made, often by the fashion students he teaches every year. &quot;I say to them, make me something that I would be embarrassed to wear. I challenge you to do it! And they try their hardest, bless them. I get some superb outfits out of it, I really do.&quot; Someone asks Perry to name the most humiliating thing that&apos;s ever happened to him. &quot;And did you enjoy it?&quot; He laughs. &quot;Well it was nothing to do with dressing up, probably. It was probably some hideous faux pas that I&apos;ve made. No, when I talk about dressing for humiliation, it&apos;s probably a fantasy of humiliation that I kind of have, rather than actual. Like a lot of sexual fetishes, you know, the fantasy is much nicer than the reality.&quot; Claire is, famously, banned from Perry&apos;s studio, and a reader asks, Why does Claire have to be so neat and clean. Doesn&apos;t she need a busy space too? &quot;She&apos;s not a real person,&quot; he points out with a tart laugh. &quot;This is it. It&apos;s me in a dress. I&apos;m a busy man these days so I dress up when other people dress up, or I&apos;m doing a show. If other people are putting on a bit of slap then I will.&quot; I&apos;d decided not to ask Perry any of the hypothetical questions readers had submitted \u2013 just because they were rather elaborate and would, I feared, take up too much time to get through, one alone running to well over 100 words. But then someone in the audience asked a concise one: if Perry could live another 200 years as an artist, would he still be a ceramicist or would he use digital media? &quot;Oh I do use digital media,&quot; he countered. &quot;Now I only make pots probably half the time, if that. My next show, I&apos;ve done it all on Photoshop mainly. I&apos;m not a luddite when it comes to digital media at all.&quot; Well well. At the very beginning Perry had expressly asked not to be questioned about future projects \u2013 and yet this reader&apos;s hypothetical scenario got him talking about it, and produced the one news story of the session. Truthfully, I would never have asked that question. It is a sobering and rather confronting thought. The overwhelming legacy of this experiment is, to my surprise, guilt. I feel terrible about all the readers whose questions I never got to ask. I consider emailing them with apologies and explanations \u2013 until it occurs to me that they, more than anyone, have probably gained the single greatest insight into what it&apos;s really like to interview people. It&apos;s not about deciding what to ask, or how to trick the interviewee into answering. Most of the time, it&apos;s really just about what to leave out.", "sentences": ["A member of staff at an Amsterdam gallery, Perry recalls, came across one of his pots while rummaging through the basement for a ceramic show."], "title": "Grayson Perry: 'The most interesting thing about Damien Hirst is probably his accounts'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/25/grayson-perry-interesting-thing-damien-hirst", "tags": ["Grayson Perry", "Art and design", "Turner prize", "Damien Hirst", "Turner prize 2003", "Tate Britain", "Awards and prizes"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-25T16:47:44Z", "article": "Far right and anti-Islamic groups are due to hold a rally in Denmark on 31 March organised by the English Defence League (EDL) which it claims will be the start of a pan-European movement. The rally will take place a few weeks before the start of the trial of Anders Behring Breivik, the far right extremist who has confessed to the murder of 77 people in Norway last July, and is expected to attract supporters of at least 10 anti-Islamic and far right groups from across the continent. It is the second time the EDL has tried to hold a meeting in Europe. In October 2010 about 60 supporters turned up to a planned rally in Amsterdam and were attacked by Ajax football fans and anti-fascists. The EDL claims the 31 March event will be bigger. It is expected to attract several hundred people drawn from defence leagues and other far right groups that have emerged around Europe over the past two years. Observers are divided over whether the event is a significant step towards a coherent European far right movement but the possibility has raised concern. Nick Lowles from Hope not Hate, which campaigns against racism and fascism, said he was not expecting a big turnout but added some key figures from emerging far right groups would be there. &quot;The march in Denmark will bring together many of the leaders of the so-called &apos;counter-jihad movement&apos; and it is another sign of the growing international anti-Muslim networks,&quot; he said. The EDL says the Denmark rally will discuss the formation of a European Defence League with representatives from far right and anti-Islamic groups in Italy, Poland, Germany, Finland, Sweden and Norway expected to attend. Lowles said: &quot;Their focus on the threat of Islam, presenting it as a cultural war, has a far wider resonance amongst voters, especially in northern Europe, than old-style racists. They conflate Islamist extremists with immigration and in the current economic and political conditions it is extremely dangerous.&quot; Claude Moraes, the Labour MEP for London who chairs the all-party group on racism in the European parliament, described the demonstration as a critical moment and said there was widespread complacency about the threat posed by groups such as the EDL among mainstream European politicians. &quot;They have missed what is a fundamental change in the way the far right is working. Despite all the evidence of the growing influence and importance of these proxy groups there is still a real complacency about how they are operating, how deeply embedded they are becoming and how they are shaping the debate,&quot; Moraes said. Last year, a report from the thinktank Demos found a new generation of young, web-based supporters who embrace hardline nationalist and anti-immigrant groups. It concluded that far right and anti-Islamic groups were on the rise across Europe. The exception appeared to be the UK where the British National party failed to make any breakthrough last year in parliamentary and local elections. In a separate report, Matthew Goodwin from Nottingham University and Jocelyn Evans of Salford University found that a hardcore of far right supporters in the UK appears to believe violent conflict between different ethnic, racial and religious groups is inevitable, and that it is legitimate to prepare even for armed conflict. Breivik claimed he had contact with the EDL ahead of the attacks, adding that he had &quot;spoken with tens of EDL members and leaders&quot;. In response to the killings, the league issued a statement condemning the Norway killings and adding that it had no contact with Breivik. The EDL, which emerged from Luton in 2009 to become the most significant far right street movement in the UK since the National Front, claims to be a peaceful, non-racist and set up to protest against &quot;militant Islam&quot;. Many of its demonstrations have descended into violence and Islamophobic and racist chanting, attracting known football hooligans and far right extremists. In the last year it has staged demonstrations in communities with large Muslim populations including Bradford, Leicester and Tower Hamlets in London. However, it has been hit by divisions and internal rows and some of its supporters have been involved in smaller, but often more violent activities, such as targeting trade union meetings and anti-racist groups. A big turnout of anti-facists from Denmark and other European countries is expected in protest at the rally in Denmark. Projekt Antifa, a Danish coalition of anti-fascist groups, has booked coaches to take protesters from Copenhagen to Aarhus where the demonstration is being held, describing it as &quot;the capital&apos;s biggest anti-fascist mobilisation for more than 10\u00a0years.&quot; British anti-racists are also planning to travel to the rally.

As part of the British Council&apos;s Cultural Leadership International programme, Mission 2062 brought together 30 creative professionals from Europe, the Middle East and North America, all united by their interest in discovering new ways of working towards a sustainable, equitable and diverse global culture. The emergency bell has been ringing for several years already with the economic crisis adding to the ongoing challenges of globalisation and climate change. So when La Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Lyrique \u2013 a new venue based in an old Parisian theatre built in 1862 \u2013 decided to programme a 2062 season to celebrate the building&apos;s 200th anniversary 50 years ahead of time, it was natural that the event use the device of the imaginary future as a way to help direct our actions in the present.    Utopic/dystopic ideas are traps. The future is made in the present; cultures need more space for contesting reality. #m2062 #tn2020 #fb&mdash; Daniel Latorre (@danlatorre) March 23, 2012      Culture as a verb UK-based facilitators Rohan Gunatillake and Suzy Glass used storytelling to guide the group into the future by taking on alter egos from La Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Lyrique in 2062. It can be challenging to step outside of ourselves and our current views and situations, and Mission 2062&apos;s narrative-led and playful approach made it easier to imagine a wide range of future scenarios and explore different perspectives on the challenges awaiting us. Scenario-based discussions included the skills needed by the superhero artists of 2062, natural disasters affecting western Europe, and the abolition of copyright laws. With the ongoing conflict between individuals and institutions, there was a common consensus that most progress will be made by embedding culture in a more radical way throughout society and not by isolating it in a defined sector. Building on Canada&apos;s Paolo Pietropaolo&apos;s statement that &quot;music should be a verb not a noun&quot;, Tim Jones from the UK suggested the same for culture. It is increasingly important to listen to the people, with institutions acting as a bridge. &quot;That&apos;s why we need intermediaries and support to continue the work already begun,&quot; added Marie Le Sourd from France, giving as an example the many European networks already active.    We need to build more connected networks of diversely skilled individuals to create vibrant &amp; healthy communities grounded in place. #m2062&mdash; Jennifer Armstrong (@livewithart) March 24, 2012      The power of networks was also a common theme of discussion with it being recognised that networks cannot be forced but are built out of a need. Discussing the future and creating enough space outside of our day-to-day challenges to share and develop ideas is an absolute necessity, and having organisations such as the British Council to support initiatives like this workshop is encouraging. &quot;They plant the seeds and let the trees grow,&quot; said Noel Hidalgo from New York. It is then up to each tree to develop into various shapes in their own local environment.  Communication and information are global \u2013 production and consumption is local    Will the power of the people prevail over experts in 2062 community design and placemaking? #m2062&mdash; Jennifer Armstrong (@livewithart) March 22, 2012      Mission 2062 closed with Jer\u00f4me Delormas, the current director of La Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Lyrique, meeting his imagined 2062 successor Germaine, played by Suzy Glass. She told him about the major events shaping 2062 imagined by the participants during the workshop, including community awards replacing the Oscars in prestige and the rise of plurality in response to the growth of carbon-copy culture. It was encouraging to see that Jer\u00f4me had already begun to consider many of these challenges and opportunities and has started to build a visionary artistic and social programme, including educational and local initiatives such as the creation of a web platform that will turn La Ga\u00eet\u00e9 into a meeting place for buyers and local producers of organic food. &quot;La Ga\u00eet\u00e9 should be a place of resistance&quot; added Delormas. &quot;Not to close itself but to be an open place for all citizens.&quot; Mission 2062 was an important, inventive and inspiring event which will influence and energise the participants in different ways. &quot;The major impact is that we all will go back home with more certainty about our convictions,&quot; said Andr\u00e9 Akutsa from Marseille. The conversation will go on until 2062. As long as we will have people who wish to make things differently, we will discuss, we will share ideas, we will build our futures together.

For Europe&apos;s far-right parties the rally, coming so soon after the murders in south-west France by a self-professed al-Qaida-following Muslim, marks a moment rich with potential political capital. Yet it&apos;s also a delicate one, especially for Marine Le Pen. Well before the killings, Le Pen was assiduously courting Jews, even while her father and founder of the National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was last month convicted of contesting crimes against humanity for saying that the Nazi occupation of France &quot;wasn&apos;t particularly inhumane&quot;. Marine must disassociate herself from such sentiments without repudiating her father personally or alienating his supporters. To do so she&apos;s laced her oft-expressed Islamophobia (parts of France, she&apos;s said, are suffering a kind of Muslim &quot;occupation&quot;) with a newfound &quot;philozionism&quot; (love of Zionism), which has extended even to hobnobbing with Israel&apos;s UN ambassador. Almost all European far-right parties have come up with the same toxic cocktail. The Dutch MP Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-immigrant Freedom party, has compared the Qur&apos;an to Mein\u00a0Kampf. In Tel Aviv in 2010, he declared that &quot;Islam threatens not only\u00a0Israel, Islam threatens the whole world. If Jerusalem falls today, Athens and Rome, Amsterdam and Paris will fall\u00a0tomorrow.&quot; Meanwhile Filip Dewinter, leader of Belgium&apos;s Vlaams Belang party, which grew out of the Vlaams Blok Flemish nationalist party, many of whose members collaborated with the Nazis during the second world war, has proposed a quota on the number of young Belgian-born Muslims allowed in public swimming pools. Dewinter calls Judaism &quot;a pillar of European society&quot;, yet associates with antisemites, while claiming that &quot;multi-culture ... like Aids weakens the resistance of the European body&quot;, and &quot;Islamophobia is a duty&quot;. But the most rabidly Islamophobic European philozionist is Heinz-Christian Strache, head of the Austrian Freedom party, who compared foreigners to harmful insects and consorts with neo-Nazis. And yet where do we find Strache in December 2010? In Jerusalem alongside Dewinter, supporting Israel&apos;s right to defend itself. In Scandinavia the anti-immigrant Danish People&apos;s party is a vocal supporter of Israel. And Siv Jensen, leader of the Norwegian Progress party and staunch supporter of Israel, has warned of the stealthy Islamicisation of Norway. In Britain EDL leader Tommy Robinson, in his first public speech, sported a star of David. At anti-immigrant rallies, EDL banners read: &quot;There is no place for Fascist Islamic Jew Haters in England&quot;. So has the Jew, that fabled rootless cosmopolitan, now suddenly become the embodiment of European culture, the &quot;us&quot; against which the Muslim can be cast as &quot;them&quot;? It&apos;s not so simple. For a start, &quot;traditional&quot; antisemitism hasn&apos;t exactly evaporated. Look at Hungary, whose ultra-nationalist Jobbik party is unapologetically Holocaust-denying, or Lithuania, where revisionist MPs claim that the Jews were as responsible as the Nazis for the second world war. What&apos;s more, the &quot;philosemite&quot;, who professes to love Jews and attributes superior intelligence and culture to them, is often (though not always) another incarnation of the antisemite, who projects negative qualities on to them: both see &quot;the Jew&quot; as a unified racial category. Beneath the admiring surface, philozionism isn&apos;t really an appreciation of Jewish culture but rather the opportunistic endorsement of Israeli nationalism and power. Indeed you can blithely sign up to both antisemitism and philozionism. Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik described himself as &quot;pro-Zionist&quot; while claiming that Europe has a &quot;considerable Jewish problem&quot;; he saw himself as simultaneously anti-Nazi and pro-monoculturalism. The British National party&apos;s Nick Griffin once called the Holocaust the &quot;Holohoax&quot;, subsequently supported Israel in its war &quot;against the terrorists&quot;, but the day after the Oslo murders tweeted disparagingly that Breivik was a &quot;Zionist&quot;. Most Jews, apart from the Israeli right wing, aren&apos;t fooled. They see the whole iconography of Nazism \u2013 vermin and foreign bodies, infectious diseases and alien values \u2013 pressed into service once again, but this time directed at Muslims. They understand that &quot;my enemy&apos;s enemy&quot; can easily mutate into &quot;with friends like these ...&quot;. The philozionism of European nationalist parties has been scrutinised most closely by Adar Primor, the foreign editor of Haaretz newspaper, who insists that &quot;they have not genuinely cast off their spiritual DNA, and ... aren&apos;t\u00a0looking for anything except for Jewish absolution that will bring them closer to political power.&quot; Similarly Dave Rich, spokesman of the Community Security Trust (CST), which monitors antisemitic incidents in Britain, told me that far-right philosemites &quot;must think we&apos;re pretty stupid if they think we&apos;ll get taken in by that. The moment their perceived political gain disappears they revert to type. We completely reject their idea that they hate Muslims so they like Jews. What targets one community at one time can very easily move on to target another community if the climate changes.&quot; Rich&apos;s words, spoken before the murder of Jews in Toulouse, now sound chillingly prescient. The president of the French Jewish community, Richard Pasquier, judges Marine Le Pen more dangerous than her father. French Muslim leaders rallied round\u00a0Jewish communities last week. Next week sees the start of Passover, a festival celebrating the liberation of Jews from slavery in Egypt, when Jews often think about modern examples of oppression. Let&apos;s hope that French Jewish leaders use the occasion to rally\u00a0round Muslim communities, and\u00a0to\u00a0remember that ultimately, racism\u00a0is indiscriminate. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 March 2012.

But after more than half a century of being overlooked, it has been authenticated as a genuine and outstanding work by Rembrandt. And the identification \u2013 by the world&apos;s leading expert on the 17th century Dutch master \u2013 will make a multimillion pound difference to its price tag. The painting, known as The Old Rabbi, has rarely been seen by the public since it was last exhibited in 1950. Since then it has hung in the private apartments of Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, family home of the dukes of Bedford. Although there is no suggestion it will now head for the auction rooms, the price difference between a genuine Rembrandt and even the best work by his studio is in the order of millions. In 2009, a world record was set for his work when a half-length portrait of a young man sold for \u00a320m at Christie&apos;s. &quot;We were all so excited at the expert verdict \u2013 the Duke was absolutely cock-a-hoop,&quot; said Abbey curator Chris Gravett, who had noticed the evident quality of the painting during his nine years working for the duke, and had become increasingly intrigued by it. This was despite competition from a collection that includes 10 paintings by Van Dyck, 12 by Reynolds, three Gainsboroughs, and a room virtually wallpapered with 24 Canalettos bought by the 4th Duke on the Grand Tour in the 18th century. The detective work by Ernst van de Wetering, a Dutch art historian and chair of the Amsterdam-based Rembrandt Research Project, has also restored the reputation of another suspect painting \u2013 a portrait of the artist&apos;s wife Saskia owned by the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie in Berlin. Van de Wetering, who spent a long day at Woburn poring over the panel, now believes the two pictures are a pair, linked by details of costume, pose and jewellery \u2013 particularly the rings on their beautifully contrasted hands. The young woman&apos;s smooth flesh is markedly different from the tissue-paper-like crinkles of the old man&apos;s skin. He believes the pictures represent the biblical story of the exiled Ruth who married the kindly but much older Boaz. Both appear to be painted on mahogany panels from the same packing case which originally held sugar from the West Indies. The Berlin painting is dated 1643, but Van de Wetering believes the slightly later date on the Woburn painting was added after the painting was completed. Gravett has contacted the Berlin museum, and hopes one day the two paintings can be displayed side by side. Authenticating Rembrandts is notoriously tricky, and many paintings in national and private collections have been in and out of favour. Frequently hard up and on occasions bankrupt, Rembrandt took on alarming quantities of work, was helped by his pupils and studio assistants and sometimes overpainted earlier works. Since its brief outing to an exhibition of treasures from Woburn Abbey at the Royal Academy in 1950, where its authenticity was questioned, The Old Rabbi has hung high up in the private library among a group of paintings which have turned out not to be what previous dukes of Bedford had hoped, including a &quot;not Van Dyck&quot;, a &quot;not Hogarth&quot;, and two others not by Rembrandt. Although there is no reference to The Old Rabbi in the family archives before a mention of it being cleaned in 1791, Gravett believes it was probably acquired with the two &quot;not Rembrandts&quot; in the 1740s. It will now be taken down and displayed at head height, as the star exhibit among the display of gold and silver in Woburn Abbey&apos;s vaults when the house reopens to the public next weekend.", "sentences": ["The detective work by Ernst van de Wetering, a Dutch art historian and chair of the Amsterdam-based Rembrandt Research Project, has also restored the reputation of another suspect painting \u2013 a portrait of the artist&apos;s wife Saskia owned by the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie in Berlin."], "title": "Rembrandt's painting The Old Rabbi authenticated as one of pair", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/28/rembrandt-old-rabbi-painting-authenticated", "tags": ["Rembrandt", "Painting", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-03-28T08:15:53Z", "article": "Tomas Overtoom and Liza Koifman are the founders and creative team of clothing label OntFront (ontfront.com). How would you characterise your style? We put together this concept with hip-hop in our minds. When we started five and a half years ago, the things you could buy in stores were t-shirts and jeans or business suits. We decided to launch items for men that are exactly in between casual streetwear and more tailored, quality garments. In terms of fashion, what stores or brands really stand out? Of course Patta shoes are what Amsterdam is famous for. Filling Pieces, which we have in our store, is an Amsterdam shoe brand that does really well. Tenue de N\u00eemes on Elandsgracht has Japanese denim and denim-inspired looks. They&apos;re young and really good at what they do. In the south, there&apos;s 1, which takes the purity and practicality of the heritage style and makes it fresh. They have classic English hunting jackets, which are bought by kids who listen to hip-hop. Where can you go to hear new music? Normally we go to the Sugar Factory, Bitterzoet, Studio 80, Club Up, and places like that. Chicago Social Club is a new club night held in Boom Chicago. In terms of music, it&apos;s similar to Bitterzoet. It has everything from new soul to experimental, so the feel of it really depends on the line-up. For hip-hop, Cafe Struik on Rozengracht also has nice music playing. It&apos;s a small cafe that kind of resembles Cafe De Duivel [ed: now closed], which was more hardcore, but this is more soft and easy-going. Where do you go to grab a good drink? Door 74 is an intimate a cocktail bar. It has a living-room atmosphere with private tables. The girls who work there are amazing mixologists. Vesper is another bar that&apos;s really good with cocktails. It can get quite crowded on Fridays and Saturdays. Go when it&apos;s not too busy, because they don&apos;t have many places to sit. Any places for fashionable people-watching in Amsterdam? The thing about Amsterdam is that it&apos;s small, so every subculture mixes together here. You&apos;ve got Toko MC at the MC Theatre. It&apos;s a restaurant but they also do some club nights. Their food is fusion Surinamese that&apos;s much more refined than anything you can get from a take-away place. The theatre does a lot of multicultural exhibitions and performances with artists from Suriname or Aruba. On Monday mornings you can go to Noordermarkt. You can have coffee on the square and watch the people. It&apos;s a vintage market, so everyone that comes there is usually well-dressed or creative.     Foam.

Jan Ryan, founding director of UK Arts International, spoke of the benefits of bringing international companies to the UK in this week&apos;s Arts head interview: &quot;By being exposed to stories and ideas from other cultures, we learn more about ourselves and expand our own horizons.&quot; She was talking about audiences, but the same could be said of artists. But what are the wider implications of connecting abroad? And away from the fund, how can organisations and creatives form their own links overseas?

I&apos;m hoping to counter that, through a roundabout and slightly contradictory method, with a backhanded celebration of the fact that the UK isn&apos;t always such a bad place to be a cyclist \u2013 that is to say, there are plenty worse. A recent trip took me to two cities which, in their own ways, have significantly more limited cycling cultures. They fall into two distinct camps, so I&apos;ll treat them separately. I&apos;d be very happy to hear your views on both places, or other towns and cities where the cyclist faces a (metaphorical) uphill struggle. \u2022 Cities where cycling will seemingly never thrive. Example: Hong Kong I lived and worked in Hong Kong for just under 18 months and cycled less than at any other time since I resumed the pursuit in my early 20s. I occasionally trundled around the minor, car-free island where I lived, but as for commuting, or even riding at all around Hong Kong island (the main business and residential area) \u2013 forget it. I was reminded of this a few weeks back when stopping over in Hong Kong for 24 hours. It&apos;s one of the very few cities where, in the centre, you barely see any riders at all. There&apos;s several perfectly good reasons, not least that for more than six months of the year the climate is so hot and steamingly humid that even walking more than a few hundred metres raises a fair old sweat. Plus, it&apos;s pretty hilly. But even if you were tempted \u2013 and winter-time temperatures of around 15C or so can be ideal \u2013 you&apos;re taking your life into your hands. I&apos;d forgotten till my return how dominated by cars the roads are. The centre is bisected by multi-lane highways filled with Hong Kong&apos;s pillar box red 1980s-vintage Toyota taxis and homicidally-driven minibuses, generally speeding at a good 50mph. Even on foot the only way to get about is to quickly memorise the network of pedestrian overpasses. Hong Kong might never be Amsterdam but it could certainly do with a bit of a transport rebalance, not least to alleviate its notorious air pollution. So, two questions: can a city like Hong Kong realistically become any more bike friendly? And is their a worse city for cyclists? I&apos;m only talking about the centre of Hong Kong island and Kowloon, by the way. Cycling on the outlying islands or New Territories can be a different prospect. \u2022 Cities where cycling should be more popular than it is. Example: Auckland Yes, it&apos;s hilly in places and, once you reach the suburbs, very spread out, but Auckland really should be awash with cyclists. It has suitably temperate weather and that same spread out-ness leaves plenty of potential space for bike lanes. But wander, with the eye of a regular cyclist, around the city centre, and you&apos;re almost immediately struck by the lack of bikes on the road. Outside peak times they&apos;re almost non-existent, barring the occasional cycle courier. Those you do see generally sport the Lycra garb and haunted expression of the cycling enthusiast in a bike-unfriendly environment. The city is trying to boost numbers and, according to the most recent annual cycling survey, with some success, with 30% more riders on the roads than five years ago. But the numbers remain fairly small \u2013 just under 13,500 &quot;cycling movements&quot; observed on one day at 82 monitoring sites. It&apos;s not helped by a compulsory helmet law, in place since the mid-1990s. I was aghast to learn that the city&apos;s harbour bridge, the main link between the centre and suburbs to the north, has no way at all for cyclists to cross. They must either plonk their bike on a ferry or take a fairly long detour. As an emblem for a city dominated by cars and roads it&apos;s hard to beat. Like with Hong Kong, it&apos;s not as if Auckland couldn&apos;t do with more cyclists. New Zealand might more or less define itself through sport but it&apos;s simultaneously one of the more obese nations on earth. My questions here: are things really as bad as they seem in Auckland? What other cities should be better than they are on this front?

Estimates suggested as few as 160 defence league members from several countries gathered at the inaugural far-right summit in Aarhus for the European counter-jihad meeting, devised to &quot;send a clear message to the leaders of Europe&quot; that Islamism would not be tolerated. EDL leader Tommy Robinson admitted only 15 supporters from England made the trip, despite earlier speculation that hundreds might attend. By comparison, an anti-fascist demonstration in the same city, to protest against the arrival of the EDL, attracted up to 4,000 people. Fears of violence had seen local police mount their biggest operation on the Jutland peninsula with the tense atmosphere amplified by the start of the trial this month of Anders Behring Breivik, the far-right extremist and anti-Islamist who confessed to the murder of 77 people in Norway last July. A cohort of the Norwegian Defence League travelled to Aarhus. Although none condoned Breivik&apos;s actions, some said they shared his frustrations. One, who gave his name only as Simon, from eastern Norway, said: &quot;He had some important points. There are people who share his thinking, if not his methods.&quot; The low turnout in Aarhus is in fact the second time the EDL has travelled abroad to try to forge alliances. Its first attempt, in Amsterdam in 2010, was widely dismissed as a &quot;damp squib&quot;, attracting about 60 supporters who were met with fierce opposition from Ajax football fans and anti-racist supporters. Robinson, the main attraction at the Aarhus summit, was unrepentant despite even fewer of his followers appearing, saying: &quot;Just wait until there are hundreds of us coming in.&quot; Numerous brief scuffles throughout the day between the two groups led to more than 80 arrests as protesters hurled rocks and bottles at each other.", "sentences": ["Its first attempt, in Amsterdam in 2010, was widely dismissed as a &quot;damp squib&quot;, attracting about 60 supporters who were met with fierce opposition from Ajax football fans and anti-racist supporters."], "title": "EDL summit in Denmark humiliated by low attendance", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/31/edl-summit-denmark-low-attendance", "tags": ["English Defence League", "Denmark", "The far right", "UK news", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-04-02T10:58:00Z", "article": "Everybody talks about the internationalisation of higher education and we see it everywhere on the agenda. The global competition for talents, the emergence of international branch campuses, the debate on use of agents for recruitment of students, the internationalisation of the curriculum, all this is widely debated on all levels and around the world. We see not only European, Northern American and Pacific universities embrace the international agenda, but also emerging economies in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East have become pro-active in stimulating the internationalisation of their education. The boundaries between resource countries and target countries of internationalisation have started to become blurred. The positive conclusion one could draw from this picture is that internationalisation is on the rise in higher education. But there are also concerns. In our essay with the deliberately provocative title &apos;The End of Internationalisation&apos; (International Higher Education, CIHE Boston College, number 62, winter 2011), we stated that there appears to be a trend to move from substance to form, and that the popularity of this might lead to a devaluation of what internationalisation means and implies. Looking at recently published articles, one could get the impression that internationalisation has an identity or mid-life crisis, as Jane Knight wonders in IMHE Info (OECD/IMHE, August 2011). What in our view certainly does not help the discussion is to focus on relabeling. A recent phenomenon in the debate on the future of internationalisation of higher education appears to be the inclination to put new broad labels on the term, such as mainstreaming, comprehensive, holistic, integrated and deep internationalisation. The most common current label appears to be &apos;comprehensive internationalisation&apos;, in particular thanks to the paper with that title of past NAFSA-president John Hudzik and with the subtitle &apos;From Concept to Action&apos;. We have little against action plans to enhance the notion of internationalisation, but if one compares Hudzik&apos;s &apos;definition&apos; of comprehensive internationalisation with the generally accepted definition by Jane Knight on internationalisation of higher education: &quot;the process of integrating an international, intercultural or global dimension into the purpose, functions or delivery of post-secondary education&quot; which finds its foundation already in the early 1990s, one cannot see much difference. And that applies to other labels as well. We want to raise some considerations on what might and might not help us getting things back on track. To do so the main question is of course: why should we have to put it back on track? If we proclaim the end of internationalisation, why revive a corpse? It is the process and its different approaches which need, in our view, reorientation. This implies that the end is also the beginning of a new internationalisation. We advocate a reorientation towards outcomes and impacts and away from a purely input and output approach. Instead of bragging about the number of students going abroad and hosting of international fee paying students, the number of courses in English and the abstract claim of making students global citizens, we want to focus on learning outcomes. How can we make sure that students receive the right learning outcomes that make them ready for a world that is more and more interculturally and internationally connected? What does that mean for faculty development? What are the implications for the assessment of students? How can instruments such as study abroad, international classrooms, teaching in another language, recruitment of international students and cross-border delivery, contribute to that process? In other words: how can we make sure that all students and not only the small elite of already internationally-oriented students and faculty receive the basic intercultural and international skills and knowledge they need in current society? Is it possible to look at new ways of internationalisation such as virtual exchange? Can we learn from experiences with internationalising secondary education and build on them? Or are we sticking to the classic concepts of cross-border mobility? In recent years we have seen good practices of new approaches to internationalisation; we should embrace them and incorporate them. Without denying the importance and good work of international offices, internationalisation has to move out of these offices and become part of curriculum development, quality assurance, faculty development. In our perception the issue is not the commonly claimed divides between competition and cooperation, between at home and abroad, or between the institution and the student that have to drive the process. Instead, it should be the focus on outcomes and so on the question of why and how internationalisation can contribute to the improvement of quality of education. If we proclaim the end of internationalisation, why revive a corpse? Uwe Brandenburg is project manager and partner at the Centre for Higher Education Development Consult, Germany.

I ask students this all the time. If money and geography were no object, where would you go and what would you do? My job is to help their wildest dreams become reality. This week someone asked me what I would teach, if I could teach anything. I panicked. First, just as students doubt my veracity, I doubted my questioner. He didn&apos;t really mean anything. He meant within the bounds of the curriculum. To be fair, I don&apos;t mean queen of the fairies or king of the world when I pose the question. I mean architect in Amsterdam, soprano at La Scala, zoologist in Zambia, and so on. Even so, freedom is terrifying. Second, my mind raced. Here was my chance &quot;to dream the impossible dream&quot;. Don&apos;t blow it. Say something unbelievably creative and compelling, right now. I recited courses I&apos;d taught before and the standard array of material I&apos;d proven myself qualified to teach in graduate school and more recent scholarship. Woo hoo! Who is this boring woman? I posed a slight stretch comparative course that would necessitate a colleague&apos;s participation. I&apos;ll give myself half a point for that. I dared to share my fairy queen fantasy - a course on Bollywood, which we agreed belongs in another school altogether. My La Scala moment eluded me, and I&apos;m still mad. I embarked upon this blog in hope that I would arrive at a delayed answer via my virtual revisitation of the conversation and my inadequate reply. I want students to step into the past with me and embrace its unexpected lessons. I don&apos;t care who begat whom among the high or low born. I like to pass among the ghosts and see the world through their eyes to the extent I can. When that happens as I read a poignant diary entry or detailed newspaper description, the veil of eternity lifts. I want to share that. Guess what? It&apos;s hard. I want to take my students through the portal to the past so they will not stand on a Florida stage at some future date and proclaim opponents&apos; staffers &quot;bad historians,&quot; because they disagree over chronology while utterly incapable of making the empathetic leap into others&apos; lives themselves. I want my students to enter other real (not fictional) people&apos;s lives and ensure that they look at rioters and riot police as beings with mothers, lovers, dreams, and despairs similar to their own. To achieve this goal with greatest efficacy, I would need a time machine. Although my sons are at work on a device to break the space time continuum I can&apos;t build it into the curriculum just yet. Instead, I must rely on an assortment of old documents, contemporary discussions, and pedagogical alchemy to transport students through time by different means. When I&apos;ve taught before, we&apos;ve galloped across sixteenth-century Europe and crisscrossed the Atlantic in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as I&apos;ve attempted to guide my charges through the world that was and in many ways still is. Certain episodes make my task easier. Three Sovereigns for Sarah allows them to experience the Salem witchcraft trials acted expertly by Vanessa Redgrave with the actual documents for her script as opposed to the exponential fiction of Daniel Day-Lewis ulcerating in The Crucible. Few historical moments demonstrate social-political self-destruction with such visceral impact, but it feeds the fantasy that all the world was New England until 1776. It wasn&apos;t. Puritans just produced more words per person than most. I want the rising generation to meet Conrad Weiser as he moves across an ocean, up the Hudson and down the Schuylkill in conversation with Natives and Europeans of multiple tongues but few printed words. I want students to enter the lives that desperate widows and runaway wives patched together in the colonial countryside. So many men, women, and children flit though my mental landscape from Portland to Pune all while I realise that I&apos;ve missed millions more who could shed light on the delights and dilemmas of the human condition. If I could do anything and teach anything, I would visit them all with students in tow. I just need that machine....

While motoring organisations anticipate a relatively jam-free holiday weekend, airlines are expecting lengthy waits at passport control due to a shortage of Border Agency staff to carry out the rigorous passport checks demanded by the Home Office. British Airways and Virgin Airlines are among 11 companies that have written to the home secretary, Theresa May, to demand action to combat delays, claiming there is a &quot;mismatch between policy and resource&quot;. A Virgin spokesman said a full check would undoubtedly mean lengthy queues at airports. More than 370,000 passengers will leave Heathrow between Good Friday and Easter Monday, while 200,000 will pass through Gatwick. Threatened strike action by baggage handlers at Stansted has been called off. Those staying at home may have to negotiate closures and delays on the road and rail networks, although the Highways Agency said many works would be completed by Thursday night or suspended for the long weekend. Unseasonal wintry weather closed the A66 trans-Pennine route and some roads as far south as Cheshire on Tuesday, with freezing temperatures forecast again in the north expected to make conditions treacherous for drivers on higher ground. The Association of Train Operating Companies and Network Rail expect to carry seven million passengers over the Easter weekend. Engineering works will cause some disruption, with services to London mainline stations Euston, King&apos;s Cross, Liverpool Street, and Waterloo among those affected.

The RAC said it believes high fuel costs \u2013 with some stations reportedly selling petrol at up to 30p more than the 141.8p a litre average pump price \u2013 may deter motorists, although the AA said up to 54% of its members surveyed were likely to drive somewhere this Easter. The RAC predicts other potential motorway hot spots on the M20 coast-bound in Kent, the M40 in Warwickshire, M4 westbound into Wales, and M55 towards Blackpool. Traffic information company Inrix has identified roads heading for the West Country as most likely to cause headaches for motorists, with traffic building to a peak on Good Friday afternoon. Drivers on the M1 around Luton in Bedfordshire also expected to face holdups. More broadly, the Highways Agency believes Thursday evening and Easter Monday afternoon are likely to be the busiest over the bank holiday weekend as people set out and return from short breaks. Transport company National Express said Thursday would be the busiest day for coach travel.

And that must have been something of a relief to the Duchess of Cambridge as she notched up another royal milestone by becoming a waxwork. Photographers and camera crews jostled for position on Wednesday morning as Madame Tussauds in London unveiled its Catherine and William engagement tableau. It owes much to the skill and expertise of the Tussauds modelling team \u2013 around 30 people worked on the two models, which each cost \u00a3150,000 \u2013 that the duchess is so faithfully recreated. They were forced to work from photographs alone as, unlike previous royal subjects including the Queen, Diana, Princess of Wales, and the Duchess of Cornwall, neither the duchess or the duke was available for the traditional three-hour sitting. &quot;We created the engagement scene, that press call when they both looked a little bit nervous but so happy,&quot; said Louis Wiltshire, responsible for the duchess&apos;s head. &quot;We started by using as many pictures as we could get hold of from all sort of different occasions and we pieced the head together from different photos to get the structure right \u2013 likeness is important but so is the expression.&quot; As for the duchess&apos;s vital statistics, they remain a secret. St James&apos;s Palace obligingly provided the couple&apos;s heights, leaving the Tussauds team to deduce the rest through comparing their proportions with other royals from photographs. Unlike his wife, Prince William has long been on display at the central London attraction. But he has been flatteringly upgraded, including re-sculpted features and a head of hair created strand-by-strand \u2013 with, at cursory glance, a few strands more than actually adorn his real head. Stephen Mansfield, who made the prince&apos;s head, has previously worked on waxworks such as David Cameron, the Duchess of Cornwall and David Beckham, said: &quot;Visitors have been demanding this for ages, we do marketing work and the duke and duchess were right at the top of what people want to see.&quot; Michiels Ralfons, a teacher from Belgium on holiday in London with his wife and two children, was among the first members of the public to see the new additions.

Alas, however, Galloway&apos;s hectic schedule did not quite allow him to inform his loyal Bradford campaign team of the happy news. Thus one volunteer was mortified to read the papers on Tuesday and realise that the woman she had met on Galloway&apos;s battle bus two days earlier was not, in fact, the third Mrs Galloway Rima Husseini, with whom the MP has two young children, but the newly minted fourth, Putri Gayatri Pertiwi. Knowing that the MP and Husseini had recently had a second child (son Faris was born in December), the campaigner had asked Mrs Galloway where the children were. &quot;Er ... in London,&quot; came the embarrassed reply from the woman who had held the title for less than 24 hours. \u2022 Excellent, meanwhile, to see Tottenham&apos;s Jobcentre Plus, inconveniently torched during last August&apos;s riots, being reopened this week by the employment minister Chris Grayling (we&apos;ll quickly pass over the fact that while locals spotted a frenzied street-cleaning effort before a recent visit by communities minister Eric Pickles to tidy the streets, they didn&apos;t bother for Grayling). James Snelling, the centre manager, told the local Haringey Independent he was &quot;really thrilled&quot; to see it reopening. &quot;I think what we have today is a real opportunity to show people how many opportunities there are out there.&quot; We can help with that.

The high-pitched wailing accompanying it, meanwhile, is the mournful song of sculptor Luke Jerram, who created the artwork \u2013 several tonnes of steel tubes designed to interact with the breeze. Following admired outings at Lyme Park and the Eden Project, Jerram was persuaded by a US company to instal the sculpture at Docklands so that its execs could fly in to discuss buying the work. No sooner was it in place, however, than he got another call saying the firm had decided on another piece instead. If no buyer can be found Jerram may be forced to sell it for scrap. &quot;Compact designer Docklands property,&quot; he says dismally, &quot;no kitchen or bathroom facilities.&quot; \u2022 Is this the most party appropriate contraption ever?

It was fired in Sarajevo, where on Friday \u2013 also the city&apos;s day of liberation from fascism in 1945 \u2013 tens of thousands of citizens walked in silence along the length of an extraordinary installation: 11,541 red chairs, each representing a life lost during the siege of the city between 1992 and 1996. The monument was the work of Haris Pasovic, famous for producing Samuel Beckett&apos;s Waiting for Godot with Susan Sontag during the siege. The crowds filed past the representation of a river of blood in muffled silence, placing flowers and sometimes scrawled names, weeping openly when passing the 1,000 or so tiny seats commemorating the city&apos;s murdered children. But 90% of the 100,000 killed in Bosnia&apos;s war were lives lost beyond the infamous siege of the capital, in places the world has long forgotten: Visegrad, Foca, Vlasenica, Prijedor\u2026 and, of course, Srebrenica. It was in the rural reaches that two million people would be burned out of their homes over the three bloody years to follow. Within three months of this weekend in 1992 the Bosnian Serbs had unleashed a hurricane of violence across the land, putting Muslim and Croat villages and towns to the torch. It was my accursed honour, along with Penny Marshall of ITN, to stumble into and reveal the existence of concentration camps in the far north-west of Bosnia, Omarska and Trnopolje, into which thousands of non-Serbs were corralled to be killed, tortured, raped \u2013 and the survivors deported. I kept in touch with those who survived and those who were bereaved by the camps and, in time, their children, over the 20 years. They were shattered and scattered across Europe and the US; scattered in history too, for the narrative of what happened was never given back to them; there has been no reckoning in Bosnia, no real calling to account beyond judgments at the tribunal in The Hague. And certainly no &quot;closure&quot;, to use that ghastly term. I watched them rebuild their lives, or try to, and even their incinerated houses. I went to weddings at which one refugee child from Switzerland would marry another from Missouri, their parents having been neighbours once, so that the villages lived on, but in far-flung exile. And last year, for a book, I toured this diaspora, across Europe and the US, to measure the reckoning. &quot;Reconciliation&quot; and &quot;post-conflict resolution&quot; are buzzwords these days and a lucrative industry for the colonial international strata that still live, on tax-free salaries, in Sarajevo. But these words \u2013 reconciliation and resolution \u2013 are also lies, for what I found, in the absence of reckoning for these refugees and survivors, was post-conflict irresolution. Open wounds and nightmares that deepen with time, redeemed \u2013 if at all \u2013 not by any fantasy of reconciliation, but strength of will, family, alcohol and laughter among those who call themselves &quot;the limbo people&quot;. &apos;I am a man who laughs. This is what saved my life \u2013 silly jokes&apos; FIKRET AKIC: Then a prisoner in the Trnopolje camp; now back at his home near Kozarac Who could forget the image of Fikret Akic behind the barbed-wire fence at Trnopolje? He had been transferred that morning from another camp, Keraterm. I met Fikret again in Slovenia in 1993. He said he had been &quot;talking to trees \u2013 people wondered, what kind of a man wants trees for friends?&quot; His life became a tribulation, and a survival of sorts \u2013 an industrial accident working at an abattoir in Denmark, then finding a wife \u2013 &quot;I woke up one morning and I was married&quot; \u2013 and having three children. I also met him several times again at the annual Omarska commemorations. Fikret was each time more the jester, the man of defiance and hollow humour, the humble sage. In 2008, he took me to the foundations of his childhood home in Alici, far above Kozarac. And he promised me he would rebuild it. Last year Fikret greeted me with the words: &quot;I have not been sleeping, Eddie!&quot;. Not only had he started work on his childhood home, for his mother, but he had also built another in town for his own family. Only there was a terrible cruelty of fate: his younger brother had suddenly flipped. He had woken up one morning, talking about the camps, and has never stopped doing so since. Their mother is therefore obliged to spend much of her time caring for him at a mental hospital in Denmark. I asked Fikret: So how did you make it, how did you survive? He answers with care: &quot;Two things. One: I am a man who laughs. And this is what saved my life. I survived because of silly jokes that are more sad than funny. But if I hadn&apos;t learned to laugh at all, I wouldn&apos;t have made it. We are funny people in Bosnia, and that is how we have survived.&quot; And the other thing that stood between you and despair? He swept his arm across the valley below: &quot;This place. Out here in the vukojebina&quot; \u2013 a Bosnian term for the wild, literally, &quot;where the wolves fuck&quot;. &quot;If it wasn&apos;t for this place, I&apos;d be long dead.&quot; &apos;I feel a need to keep my Bosnian self alive, keep the culture alive&apos; AZRA BLAZEVIC AND EDINA STRIKOVIC: Then a family in Trnopolje; now living in St Louis, Missouri, and Germany In the Trnopolje camp, Azra Blazevic toiled as best she could in a supposed &quot;medical centre&quot;, to treat those brought in after beatings by camp guards. Off-camera, Azra said: &quot;It&apos;s as bad as you fear. They kill, they torture \u2026 take this.&quot; And she slipped us a roll of undeveloped film. It contained horrific images of emaciation and of torsos beaten black and blue. Four years later, the time came to testify at The Hague war crimes tribunal against its first defendant, Dusko Tadic, who had toured the camps, killing and beating at will. Witnesses arrived at the Bel Air hotel in the heart of the Dutch seat of government and I noticed a woman with a more collected demeanour than the others. Azra, I thought to myself, Azra from Trnopolje, here? &quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;it&apos;s me.&quot; From the witness box, Azra Blazevic began to recount the story of life in the camp and of the mass rape of young girls, a theme which had eluded us in 1992. She now lives in the US. On Easter morning 2011, my train from Kansas City pulled into a halt called Kirkwood and there was Azra. In the US, she says, &quot;people love the idea of progress \u2013 it makes people happy if things are supposedly getting better in the world, they like happy endings. I was kindly invited to a Christmas party recently, and someone asked: &apos;What happened in Bosnia?&apos; I said: &apos;Do you really want me to tell you in five minutes over Christmas crackers?&apos;&quot; Touring the US, Bosnia and Europe talking to the survivors, I travelled with Edina Strikovic, Azra&apos;s daughter, who had been a child prisoner when I had first met her. Edina, raised in Germany and the US, talked about a life made up of &quot;leaving home to go home. You are always living in limbo. I feel a need to keep my Bosnian self alive, to keep the culture alive as well as the memory, an imperative \u2013 personal and generational. My parents&apos; generation are on their own; they&apos;ve survived, but they&apos;re still in limbo.&quot; &apos;They never took my pride. Not even with sexual assault. I was an object&apos; JADRANKA CIGELJ: Then a prisoner in the Omarska camp; now living in Zagreb The use of rape as a means of brutalisation in Omarska was not widely known until a film was made in 1996 entitled Calling the Ghosts in which two women, Jadranka Cigelj and Nusreta Sivac, talked for the first time about sexual abuse in the camp. The women told how they would be summoned from their sleeping quarters to one of two larger rooms at the end of the corridor and there violated, usually on a mat on the floor. What emerged was a grotesque hierarchy perceived by the violators to equate rank among the women with rank within the camp command: the commander of Omarska, Zeljko Mejakic, had made it his business to &quot;have&quot; a woman called Jadranka Cigelj, as the senior official in the arch-enemy Croatian nationalist party. I came to know Jadranka in New York, but she now lives in Zagreb. &quot;At night, the guards would come to the doors of our quarters, call us out and take us away,&quot; she said. One night at about 9.30, the door opened and there was the commander of the guards, Zeljko Mejakic, and he called my family name. &quot;I followed him and went into the room where he led me. There were six or seven men there. First they insulted me \u2013 then Mejakic ordered me to lie on the floor and took his liberties with me. &quot;This went on for four hours, after which I was taken back to the room. I didn&apos;t tell anyone what had happened to me, and nobody asked \u2013 it was an unspoken rule, that we not share what had happened to us during these intervals.&quot; Last summer, a train from Zagreb arrived at Prijedor station. As it pulled away, Cigelj picked her way across the tracks and out into the town where she grew up and from which she was taken to Omarska. She stood out immediately: elegantly dressed and carefully made up, an apparent outsider in tatty Prijedor, not someone retracing her life here and its abrupt end. Jadranka was visiting her best friend in the camp, Hasiba, or &quot;Biba&quot;, Harambasic. There followed an extraordinary, entirely unsolicited exchange, as dusk fell. &quot;What they did to me was the worst thing they could do,&quot; said Biba. &quot;My pride was not taken from me by the abuse and physical hardship. But when they sexually violated me, they took the last of my pride. When they did that to me, I thought to myself: &apos;I&apos;m done. I&apos;m dead inside&apos;.&quot; Jadranka replied softly: &quot;That&apos;s not how it was for me. They never took my pride. Not even with sexual assault. I was an object, not a subject, and the subject kept her pride. &quot;Pride is looking straight at your violator, so that he knows what he has done and what he is. If I had let him do it for a piece of bread, that would have taken my pride. But by force, no.&quot; Jadranka adds: &quot;This was my offence,&quot; and she pulls out an identity card from the period: a haughty face, high cheekbones, jet black hair and very beautiful. &quot;Six months after that picture was taken, I was in Omarska. I was attractive, divorced, intelligent and successful \u2014 GUILTY!&quot; &apos;It was a different kind of screaming: a man who knows it won&apos;t stop&apos;  SATKO MUJAGIC: Then a prisoner in Omarska; now living in the Netherlands At the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, witnesses testified to horrific episodes of torture in Omarska such as when one prisoner was forced to bite off the testicles of another, called Emir Karabasic, while the guards whooped. Satko Mujagic had been the boyfriend of Karabasic&apos;s niece. He told me that two days before this, &quot;Emir was in our room, beaten so bad he couldn&apos;t walk and seemed to know something awful was going to happen. There was a man with us called Hamdija, who asked Emir: &apos;What have they done to you?&apos; and Emir replied: &apos;Nothing compared to what they&apos;ll do next&apos;. A prisoner gave him a jacket, saying &apos;that&apos;ll protect you a bit&apos;, but Emir said: &apos;I won&apos;t need anything any more&apos;. &quot;We heard the song they played while they were doing what they did: it was famous, by Sinan Sakic, called &apos;Pusti Me Da Zivim&apos; \u2013 Let Me Live. He was screaming for 35 minutes, and we sat upstairs and listened. It&apos;s a different kind of screaming from a normal beating, the screaming of a man who knows that it&apos;s not going to stop, and it&apos;s only a matter of minutes before you depart this life. You can&apos;t reproduce it and you don&apos;t hear it in any other circumstances.&quot; Satko now lives in the Netherlands. He picked up Dutch quickly, playing basketball; as early as 1994, he had enrolled to study law at the University of Amsterdam. &quot;But there were moments: I turned 21 in Haarlem and held a party at an asylum seekers&apos; centre. And while other people would have celebrated their 21st birthday happily, I ended up running down the road at 3am, naked from the waist up, screaming and crying.&quot; At another party, Satko met his former sweetheart again: &quot;And she asked me what had happened to her uncle. All I could say was: &apos;He&apos;s dead&apos;. And I ran to the lavatory, and cried and howled \u2013 &apos;Why? Why?&apos; \u2013 and she was banging on the door: &apos;Satko, what&apos;s happening?&apos; It was 90 minutes before I could open the door.&quot; &apos;What happened to me all that time in the camp that I felt no pain?&apos; DZEMAL PARATUSIC: Then a prisoner in Omarska; now living in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire Under the guns of their captors, the prisoners in Omarska were too scared to talk \u2013 apart from one emaciated man seated at a table who looked up and said: &quot;I don&apos;t want to tell any lies, but cannot tell the truth.&quot; His name was Dzemal Paratusic. For years afterwards I worried that our conversation could have cost him his life. Then, in 2004, during a meeting about Bosnia at Westminster University in London, Dzemal walked in: I nearly fell off my chair. He had been among the first 68 Omarska survivors to be evacuated after we found the camp, and was granted asylum in Britain. Dzemal had worked in the steel industry, all over Yugoslavia. Now living in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, he found a full-time job with the county council as a driver-attendant working with disabled people. At the end of the war, the surviving population of Dzemal&apos;s village of Kozarac was scattered all over Europe and the world. His childhood home, where his father was murdered and from where his mother was expelled, remains in ruins. &quot;I want to rebuild that house,&quot; he said. &quot;I want my mother to see it; and I&apos;d like to live up there myself one day \u2013 away from everyone, and everything, surrounded only by nature.&quot; Last year, I returned to Borehamwood, to talk to Dzemal about surviving and reckoning with the legacy of the camps. &quot;Problems started when I went back to Omarska for the commemoration in 2009: flashbacks, impossible to sleep \u2013 I sleep for about an hour each night, then into a sleep again in the morning and, in that time, I am back in the camp \u2026 I often ask myself: what was happening to me all that time in the camp that I felt no pain?

It was\u00a0part of a series of horse portraits\u00a0I put together at\u00a0the mounted police unit\u00a0in Rotterdam. It was the first time I had\u00a0ever done a project on site, and I\u00a0specifically wanted\u00a0the animals to be bare, because police horses are never really free like\u00a0that. My subjects are always working animals. I started with police dogs and horses, then moved on to army horses in Rome, and more recently worked with tigers in sanctuaries in the US. I&apos;m always interested in what the animal&apos;s role is within society, without trying to preach about how we mistreat\u00a0them. I&apos;ve heard the cliche: that people like animals because then they don&apos;t have to deal with their own species. But, as a photographer, I\u00a0think they give you a blank canvas. If you look at a person, you immediately know they have a story. Looking at an animal gives more leeway for the\u00a0imagination.

Richard Deakin, chief executive of Nats, said the architects of the Thames Hub airport had not contacted them beforehand to discuss its feasibility. Norman Foster and partners unveiled the blueprints of the \u00a350bn project last November. London mayor Boris Johnson has championed the idea of a Thames estuary hub in response to a growing clamour in the aviation industry and business for more capacity. The government has indicated that a much-anticipated consultation on aviation this summer will look at all options for airports except a third Heathrow runway, although the launch has been delayed until after the mayoral elections. Deakin said the proposed site for the new airport, on the Isle of Grain, was directly under the convergence of major arrival and departure flight paths for four of London&apos;s five airports. Pointing to the Thames estuary on a map, he said: &quot;The very worst spot you could put an airport is just about here.&quot; He said there were &quot;serious challenges&quot; to integrate an airport into that traffic pattern, and added: &quot;We&apos;re a little surprised that none of the architects thought it worthwhile to have a little chat&quot; with the air traffic controllers. While Deakin conceded that &quot;technically anything is possible&quot;, he said that beyond the well-documented risk of strikes from the thousands of birds found in the wetlands, the proximity of Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport would also affect traffic patterns and force aircraft into more circuitous flight paths. Such flight paths would run counter to much of the work being done to reduce fuel consumption in air travel. Industry bodies such as Sustainable Aviation say significant cuts in aircraft CO2 emissions could be made by planning more direct, intelligent flight paths. He said that from an air traffic control point of view, &quot;the single biggest thing we could do to reduce CO2 in the UK is to build a third runway at Heathrow&quot;. Deakin claimed that the extra runway could cut the need for aircraft to hold in the skies before landing. &quot;Heathrow holding is not about airspace \u2013 it&apos;s about lack of tarmac. I&apos;m very confident you&apos;d eliminate all the holding patterns in one go.&quot; Pressure for new airport capacity has grown in recent months after intense lobbying from airport operators BAA and calls from within the Conservative party for the government to reconsider its opposition to the third runway \u2013 although a block on all airport expansion is explicitly laid out in the coalition agreement. Last month the prime minister apparently gave fresh impetus to Boris Johnson&apos;s vision by announcing he would &quot;examine the case for an estuary airport&quot;. David Cameron said Britain needed &quot;to retain our status as a key global hub for air travel, not just a feeder route to bigger airports elsewhere, in Frankfurt, Amsterdam or Dubai&quot;. The owners of Heathrow argue that there is a need for more capacity at a British &quot;hub&quot; airport \u2013 one big enough to allow enough connecting flights and transfer flights to make long-haul routes economically viable. However, they believe \u2013 and the Department for Transport&apos;s own analysis has concluded - that there is only room for one such hub airport in the UK, meaning that any Thames estuary airport would mean the closure of Heathrow and loss or relocation of 70,000 jobs in the M4 corridor. Johnson&apos;s original &quot;Boris Island&quot; plan was for an airport at Shivering Sands, a few miles east of Foster&apos;s planned hub. He has said Heathrow is &quot;fundamentally in the wrong place&quot;. Campaigners question the need for extra capacity. Environmentalists meanwhile have warned that any Thames estuary airport development would spell disaster for local birdlife, including protected species. The Foster scheme, at the easternmost point of the Hoo peninsula, would incorporate a \u00a36bn new Thames barrier crossing and a \u00a320bn four-track, high-speed passenger and freight orbital railway around London, as well as new roads to serve an airport with four runways capable of handling 150 million passengers every year. A spokesperson for Foster and Partners said that one of its architects, Huw Thomas, along with two members of the Halcrow engineering group collaborating on the project had since visited Nats&apos; Swanwick HQ, in December 2011. A DfT spokesperson said: &quot;In the summer we will consult on an overarching sustainable framework for UK aviation and alongside this we will publish a call for evidence on maintaining effective UK hub airport connectivity.

He highlighted two recent incidents that had occurred on charter flights, seen by the disapproving eyes of Home Office monitoring staff. One, on the outbound flight, involved a guard writing on the face of his colleague with a marker pen. The other, which occurred when the same flight returned to the UK, involved a guard &quot;breaking wind, seemingly on command, for the benefit of entertaining colleagues&quot;. The letter from Roy Stagg, the acting senior charter operations manager at Reliance, admonished the &quot;childish&quot; behaviour, which he linked to a deeper, and potentially more ingrained problem. He wrote: &quot;The company is dealing with something more cultural than isolated \u2026 culture can be hard to change but it is not impossible.&quot; An investigation by the Guardian has revealed the scale of the challenge facing Reliance. The company, which took over the deportation contract in May last year, has faced a revolt from within, with disenfranchised guards angry at what they saw as a host of cost-cutting measures and changes to working practices. Reliance also recognises that tough action needs to be taken to stamp out the prejudice and sometimes aggressive behaviour among some of its staff. Under European employment regulations the company inherited staff from the previous contract-holder, the private security firm G4S, which was plagued by reports of brutal treatment and neglect of detainees. Jimmy Mubenga, 46, an Angolan deportee, died while being forcibly restrained on a flight from Heathrow in October 2010. Three G4S guards were arrested on suspicion of possible manslaughter \u2013 they remain on bail. The Guardian has obtained details of seven other cases in which detainees claim they were assaulted or abused by escort guards since Reliance took over the contract. Reliance said it had been made aware of five of the cases which it said were &quot;thoroughly investigated by UKBA and all allegations of assault were found to be unsubstantiated&quot;. It added: &quot;Reliance takes it duties and responsibilities relating to all public contracts extremely seriously and this includes demanding the highest standards of those who work in every area of the organisation.&quot; In the most recent case, which Reliance said it had not been made aware of, Nelson Babaze claimed he was beaten so badly by guards who escorted him on a flight to Uganda that he feared he was going to die. The 35-year-old, who came to the UK in 2001 claiming he had been &quot;abused and tortured&quot; in his home country, said he was repeatedly punched and kicked by guards in two separate attacks in February. One took place as the plane was on the runway at Heathrow, the other as they waited for a connecting flight at the airport in Ethiopia \u2013 where he claimed local soldiers joined in. &quot;I was scared for my life,&quot; Babaze said from Uganda, where he is in hiding. &quot;They were hitting me and punching me and I was so weak \u2026 in the end I could no longer fight or scream and I thought &apos;ok that is it, there is nothing more I can do&apos;.&quot; Felix Brunner Wamala claimed he was also assaulted by guards as he was also being deported to Uganda \u2013 this time on Christmas Eve. Wamala, 41, said he was hit and kicked leaving him with bruises to his legs and knees. In September Faith, a Nigerian asylum seeker, claims she was assaulted in front of her three young children on a plane bound for Italy. The alleged incident occurred just two weeks after the launch of the government&apos;s new &quot;family-friendly&quot; removal policy. &quot;The escorts beat me on the chest and legs, pulled my hair, twisted my left hand and put their hands around my neck,&quot; she said in October. &quot;I thought they were about to strangle me.&quot; Adbi Adam claims he was assaulted by Reliance staff during his removal to Amsterdam on the 9 August. He said escort guards grabbed his head and another escort guard tried to headbutt him. Two months earlier Joseph Kuate claims he was assaulted by Reliance staff during an attempted removal to Cameroon. He claims that, during the removal, escort guards &quot;pushed my neck backwards so hard I thought I was going to die&quot;. In May, just a couple of weeks after Reliance won the contract, Zeto Kembuku said he was assaulted during an attempted removal to the Democratic Republic of Congo from Heathrow. He claims he was dragged to the ground where he was kicked, before an escort put his hands over his mouth making it difficult for him to breathe. In a statement Reliance said it took its &quot;duties and responsibilities relating to all public contracts extremely seriously and this includes demanding the highest standards of those who work in every area of the organisation.&quot; It continued: &quot;Staff are trained in de-escalation and the use of force techniques, as set out by the UKBA, but these are only used as a last resort \u2026 Reliance operates a zero tolerance approach to unacceptable behaviour in the workplace and complaints made against staff are thoroughly investigated and, where necessary, action is taken.&quot; A statement from the UK Border Agency said: &quot;In all but one of these cases, we have either received no complaint or have conducted a thorough investigation which has found allegations over the use of force were entirely without merit.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;I thought they were about to strangle me.&quot; Adbi Adam claims he was assaulted by Reliance staff during his removal to Amsterdam on the 9 August."], "title": "Deportation contractor Reliance faces litany of abuse claims against staff", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/13/deportation-contractor-reliance-abuse-claims", "tags": ["Immigration and asylum", "UK news", "G4S"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-04-14T23:05:30Z", "article": "Take me there: Keswick Mountain Festival The gentle rustle of weather-resistant trousers, the sweet taste of Kendal Mint Cake \u2013 it can mean only one thing: the return of the Keswick Mountain Festival (16\u201320 May).

Travel clinic: foodie short break The dilemma I&apos;d like to take my husband, who turns 40 in June, away for a foodie short break, somewhere we can have a memorable meal without spending a fortune. Sam, Bishop&apos;s Stortford Joanne replies With an abundance of farm produce and fresh seafood, great gastro pubs and speciality food shops, north Norfolk is a gourmet hotspot. The recently opened Gunton Arms is a quirky pub with rooms combining rural charm with a contemporary edge, but the food is the star. Stuart Tattersall, former head chef to Mark Hix, is causing a stir with his gutsy, seasonal fare including venison from the surrounding park and Cromer crab. With rooms starting at \u00a395 and a three-course meal from \u00a325 a head (excluding wine) the bill won&apos;t give you indigestion. Stock up on local specialities such as hot-smoked salmon at the Cley Smokehouse, Binham Blue cheese from Mrs Temple&apos;s Cheeses in Wells-Next-The-Sea and charcuterie from Byfords Deli in Holt. The excellent Wiveton Farm Caf\u00e9 is a great-value lunch stop and from June you can pick your own produce, including asparagus, strawberries and globe artichokes. For a hands-on finale, treat your husband to a half-day cookery demo run by Michelin-starred chef Galton Blackiston at Morston Hall hotel (\u00a375).

A total mystery to most of my friends and family, this fascination has endured for more than 50 years. Although I was only 10 years old in Melbourne in 1956, the drama, the colour and the national pride in people like Ron Clarke, Betty Cuthbert and John Landy are still a vivid memory. The cross-cultural experience of our &quot;Olympic visitor&quot; (suburban homes were asked to open their doors to accommodate the overflow of visitors) is also an enduring memory. We stayed in touch with her for 30 years, until her death. My brothers and I went to many semi-finals and even some finals of a variety of events (tickets were then relatively easy to get!). At school we did projects on the history of the games, we looked at the flags of all the different countries, we learned the names of the competitors and listened to the national anthems. Suddenly my 10-year-old world stretched far beyond Australia. The happiness and excitement of these experiences carried me through the gradual tarnishing of the Games: the tragedy of Munich, the doping scandals, the bribes, the strutting athletes and their endorsements, the tidying up of venues so that visitors would not be put off by the poor. I closed my eyes and ears to the talk of money. I knew about the costs (Montreal took from 1976 to 2006 to finally pay off its Olympic debt). But somehow I retained a childish belief in the coming together of so many countries. Well, no more. My romance is over. Like many a lovesick fool, I have finally seen the light. Good luck, Londoners, in coping with the enormous cost, the hype, the privileged speeding by in their chauffeur-driven BMWs, and the stifling, staggeringly expensive security measures. I doubt that a 10-year-old Londoner will have any memories in common with that little girl in Melbourne so long ago. Pity. Lisbeth Clemens Montreal, Canada \u2022 Londoners, and British taxpayers in general, should be relieved at the efficient use of taxpayer funds to be spent on security at the 17-day Olympic Games. At $867m, this is a real bargain. In fact, there is real cause for concern that the budget falls far short of what is needed and is putting the lives of amateur athletes from around the world at risk. Consider that Toronto spent more than that in security costs for the 2010 combined G8 and G20 meetings. The G20, the major component, lasted two days and the G8, in a separate location, lasted one. To be fair, we should add one day on either end for arrivals and departures. So the total time for these two events might have been six days. And the total number of people being protected was, yes, 20. This $43m-odd per person clearly shows that Londoners are playing fast and loose with the lives of 17,000 Olympians, spending a mere $95,500 to keep each one of them alive. Even taking into account Canada&apos;s reputation for uncontrolled civic violence and continuous terrorist threats, the UK costs are clearly below par. Yes, London is spending $125m on an 18km fence (equal to $41,000 per kilometre per day), but truly effective fencing costs more like $183,000 per kilometre per day. As far as anyone can tell, around 15,000 uniformed law enforcement types, including military, (it&apos;s particularly hard to tell because many of the officers wisely removed their ID badges) formed the core of the protective forces in Toronto. On a per-protectee basis these 750 officers again demonstrate how ineffective the planned (and let&apos;s use the high-end estimate of 49,000 officers) one security officer per three athletes will inevitably be. In light of these clearly inadequate security arrangements, I for one, will not participate on the Canadian Summer Olympic team in London this year. And I will be encouraging all my 60-year-old compatriots to similarly embargo these clearly dangerous games. Laurence Bernstein Toronto, Canada The truth about JFK Richard Luscombe does not present the whole truth when he writes that &quot;The inquiry into the [JFK] murder concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald ... acted alone&quot; (What did Castro know of JFK plot? 23 March). Referring to &quot;the inquiry&quot; implies that there was only one. In fact there were two, the second demanded by a US public and Congress outraged that the first inquiry&apos;s conclusions were so patently in variance with the facts. The second inquiry found that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy. I expect better from Guardian Weekly. Greg DePaco New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada Building the wall South Africa was also an armed camp until it ditched apartheid (Israel races to fortify its frontiers, 6\u00a0April). Today most South Africans are happy to live in a normal society. In the same way, Israel will not be safe until it ditches Zionism and becomes a country for all its people, including for the remaining indigenous Christians and Muslims who constitute a fifth of the population. Israel will be safer if it joins the Middle East, like South Africa joined Africa. The white South Africans thought they would be driven out, but that did not happen. Mikael Grut London, UK Stacking the courts Martin Kettle&apos;s warning about a politicised US judiciary might better be directed at the stacking of courts anywhere with judges so conservative that they effectively don&apos;t subscribe to democracy at all (Beware US-style judiciary, 6 April). The highest courts in most anglophone countries are effectively picked by politicians, who themselves are increasingly selected by the corporate interests of their respective countries. Judges, in turn, are mainly drawn from a profession renowned for its preoccupation with the conservative values of authority, decorum, tradition and hierarchy. Australia, which outwardly seems just another moderate country, is also the only developed democracy unconstrained by a bill of rights or a major party that supports one. The opposition opposes a tax on windfall profits from mineral exports, while the ostensibly more liberal federal government has floated the idea of legislating against public criticism of its private-sector logging exporters. The devotion of elected leaders, their sponsors, and hence their appointees, to abstract principles of democracy and justice seem feeble compared to their passions for power and economic victory. John Hayward Weegena, Tasmania, Australia European values The nine-month investigation conducted by the Council of Europe into the deaths of all but nine of 72 African migrants in the Mediterranean last year criticised Nato and the UN for insufficient planning for the inevitable increase in refugees fleeing north Africa during the intervention in Libya (Damning verdict on refugee boat tragedy, 6 April). I rather fear that the response to the exodus of migrants was perfectly well planned and ruthlessly executed: it was to simply leave men, women, children and infants to slowly die on the high seas, thus hopefully deterring others who might share the same aspirations. They did, after all, know exactly where the stranded migrants were located. I&apos;m not sure what was ever really meant by &quot;European values&quot;, but I&apos;ve got a better idea now. Jim Thomson Salzburg, Austria Death of proper English Regarding your piece Darwinian competition kills off words (6 April): If you&apos;ve heard a BBC commentator say &quot;the amount of cars on the road this weekend \u2026&quot;, you already know that spoken English, at least, is ridding itself of &quot;unnecessary&quot; duplications. Amount replaces number, much is as good as many, and not/or is as accurate as neither/nor. The misplaced apostrophe is the first sign that it&apos;s a punctuation mark we don&apos;t need and may lose entirely (and wouldn&apos;t Shaw be pleased): it&apos;s is a possessive, coat&apos;s is a plural and does&apos;nt, well, you know what I mean. Intelligent, thoughtful but error-ridden comments on websites, and copywriters who think the adverbial \u2013ly is a frill (Apple tells us to &quot;Think different&quot;), imply that our schools have given up teaching the why of grammar though, as an English teacher in Holland, I know how few and how simple the rules are.

But the cheapest available ticket Guardian Money could find from London to Paris on megabus.com was \u00a34 - for travel on Sunday 20 May. Transport group Stagecoach, which owns Megabus, has pledged to &quot;shake up&quot; the European coach market in the new move, which offers cross-channel customers a link between London and Boulogne, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. It announced fares starting from just \u00a31 or \u20ac1 and up to \u00a350 (plus 50p booking fee) on a fleet of new coaches equipped with free Wi-Fi and toilets.

The journey by bus from London to Paris will take approximately nine hours. But internet talkboards are full of complaints that the tickets sold out quickly and questions about how many there were to begin with. A spokeswoman for Megabus said: &quot;We won&apos;t be giving a detailed breakdown of seat costs but there are \u00a31 seats available on every service. As tickets have been on sale for the past month, many of the cheapest fares have already been snapped up. We have already sold out more than 80 trips but there are still plenty of good value seats on sale.&quot; The Advertising Standards Authority&apos;s code on sales promotions does not specify how many seats must be available before a company can advertise a fare. Instead it states that: &quot;Promoters must be able to demonstrate that they have made a reasonable estimate of the likely response to a sales promotion and that they were capable of meeting that response. Phrases such as &apos;subject to availability&apos; do not relieve promoters of their obligation to do everything reasonable to avoid disappointing participants.&quot; However, the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) says in a help note that &quot;if marketing communications include a &apos;from&apos; fare, a minimum of 10% of reservable seats must be available at that fare&quot;. Disappointed bargain-hunters should note that bookings for the next wave of travel dates \u2013 from Monday 21 May \u2013 will be released shortly. The service is expected to be very popular with students, who get a further 10% discount if they hold a NUS card.

It isn&apos;t even the best on Blue, the album on which it appears (A Case of You is, obviously. Or is itCalifornia?). But it is the one song I know for sure has stamped itself on my mind in a way that goes beyond merely liking the melody or a clever lyric. I rarely choose to play it; it chooses to swim up from my subconscious and play itself to me. And I&apos;ve learned to think of it as a child tugging on my skirts, trying to alert my attention to something that isn&apos;t quite right. The first time I heard it, in my early 20s, I was in a relationship I wasn&apos;t sure I wanted to be in and Carey, with its jaunty, joyful tune and Mitchell&apos;s airborne vocals, made me think hot, dusty sunshine and wine and new friends and &quot;scratchy rock&apos;n&apos;roll&quot; sounded like a much better option. Mitchell&apos;s exquisitely painful \u2013 and never bettered \u2013 songs about relationships ending are to be found elsewhere on the album, of course; this song is about her time in a hippy commune in Crete in the late 60s, a place she had found when, in her own escape from the fame and success of her first three albums, she set off around Europe. Carey was the cook at the Mermaid Cafe, who wore his red hair tucked into a turban, the &quot;bright red devil who keeps me in this tourist town&quot;. When Mitchell sings &quot;It sure is hard to leave here, but it&apos;s really not my home,&quot; it is not laced with bitterness and regret but an optimism that the right path is to be found elsewhere. I ignored it back then (we didn&apos;t split until a year later) but I try not to now. If I start to have doubts \u2013 in a relationship, in a job \u2013 I start to hear, quietly at first, that jangly intro and a repeat of the opening lines: &quot;The wind is in from Africa/ Last night I couldn&apos;t sleep.&quot; Over a period of weeks and months it can become deafening. I&apos;m often still too crippled by fear and comfort to do anything, but on occasion this song has spurred me into action. Carey is a reminder of escape and possibility. I like to think that one day I will, like Mitchell suggests, go to Amsterdam or Rome and &quot;rent me a grand piano, and put flowers &apos;round my room&quot;.", "sentences": ["I like to think that one day I will, like Mitchell suggests, go to Amsterdam or Rome and &quot;rent me a grand piano, and put flowers &apos;round my room&quot;."], "title": "Old music: Joni Mitchell \u2013 Carey", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/19/old-music-joni-mitchell-carey", "tags": ["Joni Mitchell", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Folk music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-04-20T21:55:12Z", "article": "The Northern Ireland tourist board is currently running a campaign with the slogan: &quot;Our Place, Your Time&quot;. The idea is to change perceptions of Northern Ireland. This is no longer the land of the Troubles: it is a land flowing with milk and honey. Golfers bestride the nation. Young bands go strutting their stuff. Snow Patrol play on a loop. The swell and the spirit of the Titanic, built in Belfast, continually rises. Film-makers, artists, fancy new buildings. And the writers, those most recalcitrant of citizens, the guaranteed gain-sayers and the nay-sayers? The troubled conscience of a troubled nation? Even the writers are rethinking. The Light of Amsterdam is Northern Irish novelist David Park&apos;s eighth book. But it might as well be his first. It&apos;s the first book he&apos;s published since retiring from teaching and becoming a full-time writer: the first book he&apos;s published that takes place almost entirely outside Northern Ireland; and most importantly it&apos;s his first book \u2013 perhaps the first book by a serious Northern Irish novelist \u2013 that might be described as a genuinely post-Troubles novel. We are sitting in Park&apos;s cottage, nestled in hills of County Down, with views out over the Mourne Mountains. He&apos;s trying to explain, over tea and biscuits, in his quiet, patient way, what it felt like being a writer in the old Northern Ireland. &quot;You felt that you were in a forced marriage, an arranged marriage. Could you write a romance set in Tuscany? Would it feel morally appropriate?&quot; For Park, the answer was clear: no. Not possible. Ulster said no. This was not the time or the place for romances in Tuscany. There were other, more pressing demands and stories that had to be told. One might argue that the trouble with the Troubles was not that writers made it their subject, but that it made them its subject. Like everyone else, they were subjugated. Their time. Their place. &quot;The Troubles had a deadening impact,&quot; agrees Park, ruefully. &quot;It damaged creativity. Our creativity was stunted.&quot; Park&apos;s work, from his early collection of short stories, Oranges From Spain (1990), all the way through The Healing (1992) and The Rye Man (1994), Stone Kingdoms (1996), The Big Snow (2002) and Swallowing the Sun (2004), to his highly-acclaimed dissection of the mechanisms of the peace process, The Truth Commissioner (2008), wrestled constantly and imaginatively with the subject of political violence. There were consequences. There are scars. Images abound throughout his work of contamination, of self-disgust, of stains, and of ineradicable sins. In The Healing, perhaps his most disturbing novel about the psychic damage done by the Troubles, one of the protagonists harbours dreams and fantasies of retribution, keeping a file of cuttings about everyone killed. &quot;He thought of the names listed in the books \u2013 the great catalogue of the smitten, the host consumed by the creeping sickness spreading out and infecting more and more \u2026 Affliction, settling like a plague and brooding on the land, infecting the souls of men and women.&quot; For Park, at last, the infection seems to have been suppressed. &quot;Finally, I was able to write a different kind of book,&quot; he says. &quot;I wanted to write a book about love. And so naturally I thought, let&apos;s get out. Let&apos;s go to Europe.&quot; The Light of Amsterdam isn&apos;t exactly a romance set in Tuscany, but it&apos;s pretty close. It&apos;s a book about love. And it&apos;s set in Holland. The book begins, symbolically, in 2005 with George Best&apos;s funeral, and Belfast saying goodbye to a favourite son and hello to a new era. Park says he adored Best \u2013 he recalls as a child seeing him play at Windsor Park, the Northern Ireland home ground, and there&apos;s a photograph of Best, in the iconic old Man United kit, in his study. &quot;In some fanciful way I see him as model for a writer: fabulous balance; brave; and the way he took the ball so close to the opponent, inviting the lunge, and as soon as they lunged, they just lunged into space, and he was gone \u2026&quot; With The Light of Amsterdam, Park, like his hero, dips his shoulder and accelerates into space. He&apos;s not the only one. However you look at it, however narrow-eyed and sceptical, this is an extraordinary period for writers in Northern Ireland, as new horizons open up, and different expectations and responsibilities begin to make themselves apparent. There have of course always been the poets, and exceptional new poets continue to emerge \u2013 Miriam Gamble (The Squirrels Are Dead, 2010), Eoghan Walls (The Salt Harvest, 2011) and Alex Wylie (New Poetries V, 2011), to name just a few, and many of them associated with the so-called and almost mythical Group, once attended by Seamus Heaney, which continues to meet at Queen&apos;s University in Belfast, and is currently presided over by Ciaran Carson, the Belfast poet par excellence. But there are now emerging novelists to rival the poets: Darran McCann, whose first novel, After the Lockout, was published earlier this year; Garrett Carr, author of a trilogy of young adult novels; Sheena Wilkinson, another young adult author, whose sequel to her first prize-winning novel, Taking Flight, is about to be published. Park, born in 1953, belongs to an older, established group of Northern Irish writers which includes Glenn Patterson, who has himself just published a book, The Mill For Grinding Old People Young, which is, in effect, a kind of companion piece to Park&apos;s novel. As Park&apos;s is a post-Troubles novel, so Patterson&apos;s is a pre-Troubles novel, set in early 19th-century Belfast. Belfast, book-ended. In The Truth Commissioner, Park has one of his characters \u2013 Henry Stanfield, the patrician, snobbish truth commissioner himself \u2013 express disgust at Belfast, with its passion for &quot;self-consoling mythology&quot; and its attempts to &quot;reinvent itself as a cosmopolis&quot;, but Park is at pains to point out that he doesn&apos;t share Stanfield&apos;s scepticism. &quot;It&apos;s not possible to remember what this place was like 30 years ago and not feel we live in a better time. There are still things that are not fully resolved, but we&apos;re moving in the right direction. I remember those times in the 70s when Belfast closed at six o&apos;clock. The city is slowly Europeanising itself. We&apos;re not quite Paris \u2026 but we are seeing a flourishing, the potential for wider perspectives. More space \u2026&quot; I wonder if in fact the lightness of tone in his new book is related more to his own sense of space and opportunities, having retired from teaching, and with his children now grown up and gone away to university. &quot;Maybe,&quot; he says. &quot;Certainly for me, teaching was not a vocation. I just got my degree and stayed on the bus, and the next stop was teacher training. It was an economic necessity.&quot; All of his earlier books were written on holidays and in the evenings, he says. &quot;And the problem was, you would come to the book and it was cold. Sometimes there could have been two or three months between the writing. The fashion these days is for writers who teach. But I was a teacher who wrote. Writing for me was always a secondary occupation. If I had to choose between marking the coursework and writing, I marked the coursework. That&apos;s what I was paid for.&quot; Those pressures and tensions found eloquent voice in the person of John Cameron, the narrator of The Rye Man, a newly appointed head teacher who is overwhelmed by his own sense of failure and by the deadening culture of common assessment instruments, and tiers of entry, and external assessment resources: interestingly, it is perhaps his angriest book. So he&apos;s relieved to have left the burdens and bureaucracy of teaching behind? &quot;I get to write every morning, for a few hours, and that&apos;s good.&quot; His work rate has definitely increased: he&apos;s already a third of his way through his next novel, provisionally titled The Poets&apos; Wives, about the wives of William Blake and Osip Mandelstam. But he&apos;s also cautious \u2013 &quot;More time doesn&apos;t make you a better writer&quot; \u2013 and conscious that it was teaching that got him started as a writer, and that helped sustain him. Oranges from Spain, his first book, was published when he was 37. He explains: &quot;I had a class in an inner-city Belfast secondary school \u2013 it was tough. I was supposed to be reading 101 Dalmatians with them. But there weren&apos;t any dalmatians on the Newtownards Road, as far as I could tell. And these two boys had a fight in the class, and they hit the fire door and fell out the back and I realised that something needed done.&quot; And so he went home and wrote a story, typed it up, and brought it in to the class, and read that to them instead. &quot;Killing a Brit&quot;, published in Oranges From Spain, is a story about a Belfast schoolboy who witnesses the aftermath of a British soldier having being shot. His students loved it. &quot;So really I started writing out of desperation and fear. It was a lifejacket. It was sink or swim.&quot; His teaching career, he says, also determined the characteristic shape and range of the books, which often consist of discrete episodes and scenes narrated by different characters. &quot;I always composed in parts \u2013 building blocks. As a full-time teacher, it was the only thing that made it possible for me to write. Also,&quot; he adds, smiling, &quot;as a full-time teacher I never had a chance to do any research.&quot; The new book is set in Amsterdam at Christmas. He&apos;s never been in Amsterdam at Christmas, he admits, though he has visited the city on a number of occasions. &quot;It was the first European city I ever really stayed in, and I was just so struck by the beauty of it, and by the history that wasn&apos;t divisive or sectarian. It was just so different. I thought it was the most fabulous place I&apos;d ever been.&quot; Park grew up in a working-class family in east Belfast. His father was a storeman in a factory. &quot;He gave his pay packet to my mother, and she gave him enough money for a Daily Mirror every day and maybe a bar of chocolate once a week.&quot; The family all attended the local Baptist church. The legacy of his Protestant evangelical upbringing is obvious everywhere in his books: plots which revolve and resolve themselves as stories of personal redemption; numerous scenes of transfiguration; and above all, a return again and again to moral questions and dilemmas. It&apos;s these dilemmas that fascinate him, much more so than mere storytelling. &quot;It&apos;s not the narrative that I&apos;m interested in. Conventionally you need a narrative. But if I could write a book without a narrative, I&apos;d be happy.&quot; He doesn&apos;t pre-plan or outline his novels: the only notes he used for The Light of Amsterdam was a single yellow Post-it note, with the characters&apos; names written on it, as an aide memoire. Searching for an image to explain his mode and methods, he recalls a tableau on the front wall of the Baptist church of his youth, showing a rainbow and the words of &quot;Psalm 29&quot;, &quot;Worship the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness&quot;. &quot;As a child, and even now, I wonder, what is the beauty of holiness?&quot; It&apos;s no surprise then that he says that he admires the quiet work of Alice Munro, John McGahern and Carol Shields, writers where &quot;there is no ego on the page. I cannot bear a book where the writer&apos;s ego is on the page. I believe a book is essentially moral. And the ego disfigures the writing. I can&apos;t have the author&apos;s cleverness or humour. I want the essence. I want it to be pure.&quot; That yearning for purity, he says, is also a debt he owes to his mother, who was a profound influence on his work. He recalls an early memory, when he was seven or eight years old, in Belfast city centre. &quot;The police were chasing a man through the crowd. And they caught him, and the man was thrown to the ground, and I was conscious of the crowd&apos;s gratification that a criminal had been caught. But I was conscious also of my mother&apos;s sadness that this individual had been hurt. And that passed to me, silently. Nothing was said, but it was understood.&quot; This extension of sympathy to the Other has become increasingly marked in his work \u2013 most brilliantly and most troublingly perhaps in The Truth Commissioner, in his depiction of Francis Gilroy, the former thug and terrorist who becomes Minister for Culture, yet who has barely ever read a book, and who feels no real remorse for his crimes. &quot;I became fascinated by his character. The temptation was merely to patronise him or satirise him. But I found an instinctive sympathy for him.&quot; Finding sympathy and extending sympathy is one of the preoccupations of the new novel, which tells the story of three sets of protagonists who all leave Belfast and arrive in Amsterdam for a long weekend. One of the protagonists, Alan, is a lecturer who is separated from his wife and who is taking his son with him to Amsterdam to see Bob Dylan in concert. Father and son have nothing in common. Another of the main characters, Karen, is a single mother on a hen weekend with her daughter, who is appalled by her child&apos;s vulgarity and selfishness. And Richard and Marion are a wealthy, middle-aged couple whose lives have drifted apart, and whose daughter is about to reveal to them a secret. &quot;The book is really about how to love your child,&quot; says Park. &quot;How to give your child love without forcing your values on them. You want them to share your moral values, but that&apos;s not how it works. It&apos;s about going on loving even when it&apos;s difficult.&quot; In the light of Amsterdam, the characters are able to gain a fresh perspective on their lives, and each other. &quot;What I have come to realise,&quot; says Park, &quot;is that communal healing is not to be found in truth commissions or in institutions, but is simply to be found in the renewed rhythms of life. Young people falling in love, children being born. The great danger about being a Troubles writer was that the book became a weapon: one attempted to impose humane values on barbarism. But in the end that just becomes a kind of feel-good exercise. And that doesn&apos;t produce good art.&quot; I ask him what he thinks is good art, and he slowly gets up, goes into another room, and puts on the opening bars of Dylan&apos;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, with it&apos;s beautiful, freewheeling, life-affirming cascade of chords. And then he walks back into the kitchen. He doesn&apos;t need to explain any further. His place.

At a dinner to celebrate the occasion he stood up and addressed a room full of friends and supporters. The meal had been cooked by five of the original 15 &quot;graduates&quot; of the restaurant, who a decade ago had swapped lives that had been derailed or drifting for the discipline and opportunity of the kitchen, and the TV series that attended it. Oliver is an emotional speaker at any time but the anniversary had been made doubly poignant by the recent suicide of one of that original cohort, Kevin Boyle. When Oliver stood up he talked about the fact that 340 young people had now gone through the Fifteen kitchens, in London, Cornwall and Amsterdam; he talked about the culture of mentoring that the restaurants had fostered, about the high excitement and &quot;brilliant risk&quot; of the launch, and he also talked about Kevin.     Fifteen's first graduates in 2002 Photograph: Chris Terry    On the wall of the restaurant is a framed photograph of the original group of Fifteen and Oliver went through them one by one outlining with a paternal kind of pride what they had gone on to achieve. &quot;Ralph I saw two months ago in New York, head chef of the Spotted Pig, with a Michelin star, just moved to LA to do his own thing. Ben is sous chef at Fifteen Cornwall, so they are starting to come back in the family. Tim here is one of our great young talents, owner of the fabulous Trullo up the road. Warren is running the Anchor &amp; Hope doing just an incredible job. Kerryann is a full-time mum at the moment but helping in the community in Hackney showing people how to cook\u2026&quot; He then looked at the next face and tried to collect himself, failed and went on anyway with his voice cracking and his eyes filling with tears. &quot;And then there is Kevin here, whose mum and dad are sitting over there. Sadly Kevin is not with us. We lost him but he was a beautiful boy and a great, great talent and one thing I know for sure is he would have just loved being here tonight\u2026&quot;     Jamie with the kitchen garden club, Orford primary school, Suffolk Photograph: Matt Russell    By the time of that dinner I have spent quite a lot of time trying to get the measure of what Jamie Oliver is about these days. I&apos;ve been up to his Ministry of Food in Bradford, I&apos;ve watched a group of kids at the Lilian Baylis school in Kennington (about which Conversative MP Oliver Letwin once said he would rather beg on the streets than send his kids to) making cakes as part of the Home Cooking Skills qualification, and talking passionately about their ambitions to be chefs; I&apos;ve spoken to headteachers who have signed up to the latest Oliver initiative for school kitchen gardens; I&apos;ve eaten in his restaurants and cooked from his books, and flipped through some of his magazines. I&apos;ve watched him on YouTube giving a TED lecture to Bill Gates and Al Gore among others, and I&apos;ve re-watched him scolding American moms for feeding their children Coke in babies bottles, and berating corporate executives for dishing up &quot;pink slime&quot;. I&apos;ve also sat down for an hour or two with Oliver himself, before and after another long-haul mission to spread the gospel of his food revolution in South Korea and Australia. For all that, though, it is when I talk to Kevin Boyle&apos;s mother Patti, after the dinner, that I properly understand what it all might mean.     Jamie Oliver with Kevin Boyle Photograph: Nigel Howard /Rex Features    Kevin Boyle took his own life after being diagnosed with diabetes, the latest in a lifetime of physical setbacks, and one he feared might take away his opportunity of doing what he lived for, cooking, and moreover, cooking with Jamie. &quot;As I said at my son&apos;s funeral,&quot; Patti Boyle recalls, proud and heartbroken, &quot;we had struggled on our own with Kevin, for a long time. It was Fifteen that actually gave him another 10 years. For that I will be eternally grateful to Jamie. Kevin was an amazingly generous person, but very troubled. The goodbye letters that he wrote to us, he wrote in church. The funny thing was that his friends there who saw him writing said they just thought he was writing menus as usual\u2026&quot; Kevin Boyle had holes in his heart, he was an asthmatic, he had a speech impediment, he had problems with his ears, and he had all the difficulties that come with depression. He never thought he would achieve anything much until he started to cook. After Fifteen he worked at Le Caprice and Smiths of Smithfield. He cooked for the Prince of Wales and the prime minister. But he never really left Fifteen. &quot;If Kevin had a couple of weeks off or was between jobs he would just come in and volunteer,&quot; Oliver recalls. &quot;At the last student graduation in October, he was setting up for the night, he was serving drinks and looking after people and he was last man here at one in the morning stacking chairs.&quot; When Boyle died, Oliver went through all the emails they had exchanged in the last few years. &quot;It was immensely sad, just because he was always so positive, always writing about how we could help other people. Nothing about himself or what he was going through.&quot; When it came to Kevin&apos;s funeral, Patti Boyle became a bit frantic about catering, knowing that her son would have wanted to put on a proper spread. But Oliver already had all that in hand, and organised the lot in a way that would have made Kevin proud. &quot;The thing about Jamie,&quot; she says, &quot;is that because he has been turned into a brand, people forget he is still a human being, and quite a remarkable human being. For all that Kevin and the others learned, I also think Jamie learned a lot from them about what could be achieved by working together. As he said at Kevin&apos;s memorial, when he started out at Fifteen you would never have got those people in the same room, let alone working with each other, but by the time they left they were the firmest of friends.&quot; She gestures around the restaurant itself. &quot;You know what this place is, it&apos;s a little bit of light in a lot of people&apos;s worlds.&quot; To understand anything about Oliver you have to start with Fifteen. It is really where it all began for him, he believes. It&apos;s when he turned from a celebrity chef on a scooter to one-man global food missionary. He was 25, not that much older than the unemployed teenagers he had taken on. He had already done three series of The Naked Chef, after being spotted working on the grill at The River Caf\u00e9 by a smart Channel 4 producer looking for a new TV cook in 1998. His series had gone all round the world, there had been books, but the money had only just started coming through. To start Fifteen he mortgaged his house against the restaurant without telling his wife, Jools. &quot;It was a moment of madness really,&quot; he says now. &quot;But I was a kid with a new lump of cash and thought, sod it.&quot; Cynics will say that nothing Oliver does is without a knock-on commercial advantage but he is unrepentant about what success has allowed him to achieve. If Fifteen had just been a one-off, he says, then his detractors might have had a\u00a0point. In fact he has trained his 30 or more chefs a year out of his own pocket, at \u00a325,000 each. Most of them came to him through the parole service. Three quarters still work in the industry, many highly successfully. &quot;Back in the first three years the tabloids were always running &apos;expos\u00e9s&apos; of how so and so has been on drugs or has a record for robbery from before they came to Fifteen,&quot; he says. &quot;It took a lot of years to explain, &apos;Yes these are the people we are trying to get involved. Kids from prison or kids from broken homes or just kids that needed a break.&apos;&quot; Talking to Oliver you quickly realise that the reason he knew for sure that food could change people&apos;s lives, and bring them together, was that his own life has been changed so immeasurably by it. He has faith in his recruits at Fifteen because he could have been one of them himself. When he was at secondary school, he recalls, he was in special needs classes for maths and anything involving reading and writing. &quot;The only things I got any marks in were art and geology which were the only subjects I did that had any practical hands-on aspect to them. I loved school, but I was rubbish at it. Luckily I was cooking from the age of eight and it stopped me resenting that experience.&quot; At the Lilian Baylis school there are plenty of kids who were just like Oliver once was. The children in Miss Rusling&apos;s cooking class have a bit of a reputation in school, several are on statements, most had behavioural issues when it came to maths and English and history, but for the hour in which I was with them, and they were working on their cooking, you could hardly have hoped to see a more engaged group of 14-year-olds. While they mixed their ingredients they were talking about the meals they had cooked at home in the previous week, shepherd&apos;s pies and curries. Before the school adopted Oliver&apos;s curriculum they would have been taught &quot;food technology&quot; which, as Rusling explains, was all about how food was produced: &quot;They were asked, &apos;How can you market an omelette?&apos; when many of them didn&apos;t know what an omelette was. They were supposed to be designing pizza boxes and so on\u2026&quot; Oliver, having spent a lot of time in schools working on his healthy school lunches programmes, realised that part of the problem was that children had no direct experience of making food. &quot;School cooking lessons weren&apos;t sufficient \u2013 you would have crap pictures of lemons on the page and yet no lemons in the classroom. That is one of the issues that we have tried to address.&quot; For Oliver, of course, the issues don&apos;t stop coming. In his office behind Fifteen in Islington, among a creative-looking jumble of current preoccupations, page proofs, thank-you letters, magazine covers and plans for his next book (of 15-minute suppers), he smiles at the idea that any of what he does is really planned. &quot;I really wish it was Jamie Oliver the brand,&quot; he says. &quot;But it really isn&apos;t like that at all. It has always felt more like a pinball sort of journey than any smooth career, I mean pinging between things that interest you, and anger you. In the mind of the public, I obviously work at a certain noisy level. But in my own brain everything I do still seems quite intimate and small, and parochial in a way. I still hope that by doing little things they can have a big consequence.&quot;     Promoting School Dinners in 2005 Photograph: Julian Makey/Rex Features    It is quite startling to realise just how far Oliver&apos;s parochial message has spread. His books sell in more than 100 countries. Four or five million people each month from across the globe use his website as a forum for all food-related information and discussion and recipes. One thing leads to another. The British School Dinners series was shown in 80 countries, and has resulted in &quot;debates in parliaments where there wasn&apos;t even a school meal system. It got people talking about hospital and prison food, all these institutions, and had people asking whether any of these places were being catered to by forward-thinking people or by box-ticking procurement machines who bought any old shit&quot;. When he talks about some of this, for all his relentless positive energy, I can&apos;t help detecting a background note of weariness. The first time I meet him he is full of flu \u2013 &quot;the only time it&apos;s ever happened to me&quot; \u2013 and is contemplating his flight to Australia. When I ask if he feels that the responsibility for global nutrition that he seems to have taken on seems onerous, he doesn&apos;t disagree too strongly. But he is not about to give up on it. &quot;You can&apos;t just stir all this up and then walk away,&quot; he says, more than once. His Ministry of Food projects are a case in point. I visited the one in Bradford, in a shop on the high street, and sat in while an animated group of men and women each made a Jamie Oliver jambalaya on eight hobs. They had come for different reasons \u2013 a couple of men had recently retired and wanted to know their way around a kitchen, some of the women were embarrassed that they hadn&apos;t had the confidence to make dinner for their children at home \u2013 but they now all shared this in common: six weeks earlier they hadn&apos;t been able to cook, and now they could, and they not only took a great deal of satisfaction in that, they were evangelical about teaching others.     Cookery class at the Ministry of Food in Bradford Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Observer    Soraya Overend, who has run the Bradford Ministry for the three years it has been open, explains how they run sessions for boys who have been in young offenders institutes, for recent widowers, for mothers who don&apos;t know the basics and children who want to learn, and corporate groups who want to build teams. Since day one the courses have been hugely oversubscribed; the comments book is full of the most heartfelt praise. The Bradford centre is mostly funded by the council; elsewhere, in Leeds for example, the local NHS trust helps out. But funding is at best erratic, and Oliver&apos;s hopes to have a ministry in every city have not materialised. He seems tired at having to make the arguments again. &quot;It doesn&apos;t cost much money. Whereas the problems it addresses \u2013 chronic health issues related to bad diet, and obesity \u2013 cost us all a huge amount of money. It&apos;s clearly working. So, I ask politicians, &apos;Are you going to crack on with it?&apos; They tell me no, we want to have your name above it. Well, if it&apos;s got my name above it then I need to be in charge of all the standards. So then all of a sudden I became responsible for yet another thing\u2026&quot; You hesitate to ask Oliver if he is spreading himself too thin because it is obviously the argument that he has with himself all the time. For a person who seems almost clinically optimistic, it is hard for him to let any opportunity to sell his message about eating well go by. It was the reason he took his school dinners road show to America, to the corporatised fast-food belly of the beast, with predictably incendiary results. Wasn&apos;t there a voice in his head telling him he couldn&apos;t take on the whole world? &quot;Of course. And America is the worst use of my time commercially, let alone in terms of my family. But I was offered a primetime show on the biggest network in the country to talk about food politics, a subject that had hardly ever been aired at all on American television. So I had to do it.&quot; His battle narrowed to a campaign against &quot;pink slime&quot; \u2013 the modified scrapings of carcasses that had once gone to dog food but had, due to an industrial rinsing process, become a component of three quarters of the &quot;ground beef&quot; in supermarkets and burgers. A couple of years after he aired the issue, Oliver is winning. Under unprecedented pressure from American consumers, some supermarkets and fast food chains, including McDonald&apos;s, have begun to drop products containing pink slime. In his campaigning, Oliver is not afraid to play a long game, to get the facts out there any way he can and hope others take up the cause. His speech to America&apos;s 2,000 corporate leaders, that followed his $100,000 TED prize two years ago, resulted in 1,800 offers of partnership and support. If he has a vision for the next 10 years it is to get some of those up and running. If he has a plan, it often looks like working on everything all at once. &quot;We have small teams working on various projects,&quot; he says. &quot;We are currently trying to be robust in America and Australia.&quot; On his trip to Melbourne he signed off a \u00a33m project funded by the state government and a corporate partner to establish Ministries of Food across Victoria. &quot;But trying to be an octopus in all these places is almost impossible. And obviously I have a family as well. So I have had to make hard decisions about finding some time to be of some use at home. I feel I can&apos;t work any harder than I am because I have four young children of my own to look after, too\u2026&quot; The Australian investment is something he is particularly enthusiastic about. &quot;I often seem more welcome over there than I am here,&quot; he suggests. If he has lost any faith over the last decade it is in the efforts of British politicians to make a difference. Having fought to get minimum nutritional standards for school food universally agreed, he is now watching those standards be eroded by the academy system which allows schools to opt out of everything, including health guidelines. &quot;I&apos;m apolitical,&quot; he says, &quot;in that I haven&apos;t voted since I started being involved. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a party political issue. It&apos;s a national issue and the arguments are clear. Me and Mr Gove haven&apos;t got very far on this one though. This mantra that we are not going to tell schools what to do just isn&apos;t good enough in the midst of the biggest fucking obesity epidemic ever. The public health of five million children shouldn&apos;t be left to luck or chance\u2026&quot; Oliver believes that the dismantling by default of the child nutrition white paper is the single most dangerous thing the coalition has done. He is not going to give it up without a fight. He has urged cross-party support for a debate on the issue, which led to an early day motion from the Tory MP Zac Goldsmith. A global &quot;Food Revolution Day&quot;, on 19 May, will boil down its British message to one word he suggests: &quot;Gove.&quot; &quot;We don&apos;t want bullshit about the big society. We want a strategy to stop Britain being the fifth most unhealthy country in the world. The most unhealthy country in Europe. This is the first generation of kids expected to live not as long as their parents. Tell me, Mr Gove, Mr Lansley, how you plan to change that? Two out of five kids are obese. What is in your arsenal? The fact is, they are doing nothing\u2026&quot; As he develops this rant, formidable in its frustration, I wonder if he believes his own perceived success has begun to get in the way of his message, that in the usual British way we half believe that with all his money he should be sorting out these problems himself? He suggests that may be the case. And that is one of the reasons why he has been &quot;quite commercial in the last four years&quot; (he has opened 30 more Italian restaurants, and launched the Union Jack&apos;s chain alongside publishing the bestselling cookery book of all time, Jamie&apos;s Thirty Minute Meals). He suggests these ventures have begun to look like a means to an end. &quot;Part of what I am trying to do now is to set up some really sustainable businesses so I can hive off some cash into pots to prove some of these ideas about children and food \u2013 school gardens, fresh and healthy eating, cooking skills \u2013 to a point where public opinion will be so strong that no politician dare argue. That&apos;s the vision for the next 10 years I\u00a0guess. I want to really show them.&quot;     Jamie Oliver with kids from Rotherfield Primary School Photograph: Levon Biss for The Observer    Oliver says this with all his usual laddish goodwill, but also with a note of adult resolve, as though it is his fate, somehow, not just his mission. What started 10 years ago for him with Fifteen, with a group of hard-to-reach kids like Kevin Boyle and a small, powerful idea about how food might change lives, has grown into something even Oliver with all the chutzpah going, couldn&apos;t quite have imagined, but which he is determined to advance. It is interesting to watch him go about his business, local and global, stirring things up as best he can. After a decade at the barricades, he remains hopeful that his revolution has only just begun. jamieoliver.com/foundation", "sentences": ["When Oliver stood up he talked about the fact that 340 young people had now gone through the Fifteen kitchens, in London, Cornwall and Amsterdam; he talked about the culture of mentoring that the restaurants had fostered, about the high excitement and &quot;brilliant risk&quot; of the launch, and he also talked about Kevin."], "title": "Jamie Oliver: 'Tell me Mr Gove, Mr Lansley.

Aussie rules football, that is. Canberra-born Taunton is predictably enthusiastic about the national sport station, which last week signed a deal with the Premier League to take its football commentaries global. It is, says Taunton, the &quot;biggest thing&quot; that has happened to TalkSport since it launched as Talk Radio 17 years ago. But it&apos;s when the discussion turns to Aussie rules that Taunton&apos;s eyes really light up. &quot;It&apos;s a great game, a rough game,&quot; he says. &quot;If you are anywhere near the ball I am allowed to take you out at any time so long as I don&apos;t do it in your back. And if you have the ball as long as I don&apos;t go above the neck or below the knee you are fair game. It&apos;s true sport.&quot; Which is a rough approximation of what TalkSport, owned by ITV Northern Ireland licensee UTV, has been trying to do to its licence fee-funded rival, BBC Radio 5 Live, over the past few years, launching a sustained critique of its output and the way it buys sports rights. TalkSport has chipped away at 5 Live&apos;s dominance of live Premier League football and broadcasts 64 games a season (compared with the BBC&apos;s 128, down from 192 a couple of years ago) with another 32 games on Absolute Radio, the Times of India-owned commercial station which UTV has twice tried to buy. With big name signings such as Russell Brand and, controversially, disgraced Sky Sports pair Richard Keys and Andy Gray, to sit alongside fellow presenters such as Alan Brazil, Stan Collymore and Darren Gough, TalkSport has been rewarded with record audiences and was station of the year at the 2011 Sony Radio Academy Awards. Its latest four-year deal with the Premier League, beginning with the new season less than four months away, will enable it to air live top-flight English football worldwide outside of Europe. The station will broadcast all 380 Premier League matches each season in three languages \u2013 English, Spanish and Mandarin \u2013 and will build 30 studios in the basement of the TalkSport offices, which are a stone&apos;s throw from ITV&apos;s HQ on London&apos;s South Bank. It currently has just two, with a third for emergency back-up. Targeting listeners in the US, India, Indonesia and, ultimately, China, is a prospect far removed from the station&apos;s former heartland audience of white van drivers ringing up to be harangued by James Whale. &quot;My favourite statistic is that 54% of adults [in the UK] consider themselves a fan of the Premier League,&quot; says Taunton, managing director of UTV Radio (GB) and chief executive of TalkSport. &quot;The only country higher is Indonesia, where 56% of people say they are fans. &quot;There are 230 million Indonesians and 60 million Brits. Suddenly we are into markets that are huge. In China 650 million people claim to be Manchester United fans.&quot; The TalkSport brand will be retained for global commentaries which will be broadcast via the internet and (ultimately paid-for) mobile apps via a branded radio player. Taunton is looking at global sponsorship deals with the likes of Coke, Pepsi or Nike and partnerships with local broadcasters. A UTV delegation will shortly travel to south-east Asia. It was the overseas focus that led the station to drop all its remaining non-sports content \u2013 an overnight programme and a weekly show fronted by George Galloway \u2013 earlier this year. &quot;People in Hong Kong, Malaysia or China tune into the station at 1am UK time and they are listening to a debate about whether we are being taxed too much and speed cameras,&quot; explains Taunton. &quot;It&apos;s part of the global positioning of the brand.&quot; The station expects the new operation to be profitable in its third year after \u00a31m losses in the first year and break-even in the second. Start-up costs will be around \u00a3800,000, with Taunton already looking at adding more languages and sports rights. The star performer in UTV&apos;s radio division, which also includes 13 local stations, TalkSport&apos;s profits were up 16% last year to \u00a37.4m with revenues of \u00a331m. Taunton was paid \u00a3387,272. The station will have live commentary from Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine \u2013 along with the BBC \u2013 a far cry from the 2000 tournament in Holland and Belgium when the station (under the previous ownership led by Kelvin MacKenzie), without any live rights, covered the matches by watching the games on TV in an Amsterdam hotel and adding background crowd noise. TalkSport also had exclusive radio commentary rights to last year&apos;s rugby union World Cup, breaking the BBC&apos;s monopoly of live coverage of the event since 1987. The BBC has the exclusive radio rights to the Olympics, but Taunton expects an uplift in audience and advertising from the excitement surrounding the London Games. With an average weekly reach of 3.2 million listeners \u2013 a million up on five years ago \u2013 TalkSport still has only half the audience of 5 Live&apos;s 6.2 million. But with the BBC station grappling with the challenges of its Salford move, and under pressure from the BBC Trust \u2013 partly as a result of TalkSport&apos;s lobbying \u2013 to cover more minority sports and harden up its news coverage, Taunton sees further opportunity. &quot;You would have to believe that we could close the gap over time,&quot; says Taunton. &quot;What we have done together is grow speech radio on a dying medium wave format that the government wants to turn off.&quot; The long-mooted digital radio switchover has been a bugbear for TalkSport, which campaigned against a proposed 2015 switchover date and quit commercial radio&apos;s trade body, the Radio Centre, in protest at its pro-switchover policy three years ago. Taunton also clashed with Global Radio founder Ashley Tabor over the issue and what he perceived to be the Capital and Classic FM owner&apos;s unfair influence over the Radio Centre. He branded Tabor a &quot;rich man&apos;s son&quot; three years ago, but has since shaken hands with him, although a return to the Radio Centre or switchover body Digital Radio UK is not on the cards. &quot;It was a heated time for the industry; it had been a long time coming,&quot; remembers Taunton. &quot;We&apos;d had disputes, not just [with] Ashley but the Radio Centre and other directors for a good 18 months at board level before in the end it just became untenable.&quot; Once the black sheep of the radio industry in the MacKenzie era, TalkSport risked pariah status once again with last year&apos;s hiring of Keys and Gray, who were sacked by Sky Sports after their off-air comments about a female official prompted a sexism row. Taunton describes it as a &quot;great solution for both sides&quot; and says listeners were &quot;willing to put aside what happened and give them the benefit of the doubt&quot;. &quot;I am not saying you would under any circumstances take people on despite what they said,&quot; he adds. &quot;They were genuinely remorseful for what had happened and saw the error of their ways.&quot; Keys and Gray are nominated for a Sony at next month&apos;s 2012 awards and it will be an interesting reception should they win. Programme director Moz Dee, key to the station&apos;s transformation, is also nominated, for station programmer of the year. The pair&apos;s arrival followed the messy exits of James Whale \u2013 fired from his late night phone-in in 2008 for breaching broadcasting regulations after urging listeners to vote for Boris Johnson in the London mayoral election \u2013 and Jon Gaunt, fired in the same year after calling a London councillor a &quot;Nazi&quot;. Taunton has more time for Whale (&quot;an outstanding broadcaster&quot;) than Gaunt, who launched a protracted legal action in the wake of his sacking and published Taunton&apos;s email address, inviting listeners to tell him what they thought. Taunton describes it as &quot;interesting feedback. Some of them needed a dictionary but nonetheless it was colourful.&quot; Their sackings also prompted MacKenzie to criticise Taunton in his Sun column. UTV bought TalkSport from MacKenzie&apos;s Wireless Group in 2005. He was still in situ when Taunton was sent over from UTV&apos;s Belfast operation to take charge of the station soon afterwards. &quot;Kelvin asked if he could have a meeting room for a week. After three weeks he was still there trying to work out his severance package,&quot; recalls Taunton. &quot;I grinned and said is this the time for me to look like the new kid on the block, and you the passionate operator who leaves kicking and screaming? You call your journalist mates and I&apos;ll call the cops.&quot; MacKenzie&apos;s response was of the four-letter variety, he adds. Taunton tells a good tale, and if he wasn&apos;t running the station you imagine he might be ringing it. Especially if it broadcast Aussie rules.", "sentences": ["The station will have live commentary from Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine \u2013 along with the BBC \u2013 a far cry from the 2000 tournament in Holland and Belgium when the station (under the previous ownership led by Kelvin MacKenzie), without any live rights, covered the matches by watching the games on TV in an Amsterdam hotel and adding background crowd noise."], "title": "TalkSport's Scott Taunton on the global game to win more radio listeners", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/22/talksport-scott-taunton-premier-league", "tags": ["TalkSport", "Sports rights", "Radio industry", "Kelvin MacKenzie", "Premier League", "Media", "Football", "Richard Keys", "Andy Gray", "BBC", "Radio 5 Live"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-04-24T08:00:02Z", "article": "&quot;Hard-working Afghan photographer wins Pulitzer&quot; \u2013 that&apos;s the general headline the international press ran with last week as Massoud Hossaini&apos;s photograph, the girl in green, won the Pulitzer prize. In the days that followed, the photo would be widely republished; Hossaini himself became the subject of interviews and articles focusing on the events that took place the day he took this powerful photograph, in the immediate aftermath of a suicide bombing during a religious celebration at a holy shrine in Kabul. Many view this Pulitzer as a welcome change from the usual routine of western journalists being honoured for their work abroad; Massoud&apos;s story was presented as a photographer covering a war and a struggle in his own country, in an effort to let the world see what is happening there. I met him last week and he described his thoughts just minutes after being wounded by the explosion: &quot;I was in shock but I also thought I had to cover that moment. To cover that pain and all those scared faces, to show it to the world \u2026 If I show this, I help those people in some way because the world will know their pain.&quot; As Hossaini is on the receiving end of a flood of well-deserved attention, it might seem like a concern for what is taking place in Afghanistan has been reignited. But what follows the interviews and reprintings of this sad picture? Has the international community really heard the message Hossaini and many like him are try to communicate to their audience? As we post and share &quot;the girl in green&quot; on Facebook walls and tweet links to the picture , are we really receiving the message? The BBC and AFP are among scores of news sources to have run interviews with Massoud, editing down his words to a compact digestible size. They focused on the horror of experiencing a suicide bombing, the modest bravery of continuing to work despite injury and shock, and his personal mission: to show the world what is happening without pulling any punches or giving in to the calls to hide so-called graphic content. All these themes are important, but they are never followed by an open discussion about finding long-term solutions. But that&apos;s just the type of media coverage Hossaini would like to see: &quot;I can&apos;t accept that the nations of the world who have peace at home and stable economies don&apos;t know what is happening in Afghanistan. It shouldn&apos;t be like that. Afghanistan is not on some other planet. We all live together on earth and whatever pain Afghanistan experiences has or will have an impact on the rest of world.&quot; During the World Press Photo award ceremony last week, which was held in the Netherlands, the audience looked on as Hossaini presented a collection of his photos. Most of them were of military activity, suicide bombings, and the struggles of daily life. The audience looked on captivated, offering a round of applause in appreciation of the photographs and the person who took them. Minutes later, they spilled out onto the streets of festive Amsterdam, having drinks and making dinner plans \u2013 not that attendees shouldn&apos;t do such a thing, but it illustrates our world&apos;s strange juxtapositions. Back in Afghanistan, the drawdown of international co-operation continues. Education and development organisations have reduced their activity in the country, as budgets have dried up and security concerns abound. By 2014 military forces will be withdrawn, a decision people in the US and Europe seem very much in favour of. The feeling is thus: &quot;We&apos;ve done our part, and it has been declared a lost cause.&quot; Afghanistan is assumed to be a place from which there are only horror stories to relay. Positive events rarely make it to the international stage, and we don&apos;t ask about the areas where life is actually improving. It is this other reality that Hossaini also wishes the world would notice: &quot;It is true that Afghanistan is in a bad situation and there is conflict, but it doesn&apos;t mean we don&apos;t have good things going on in the country as well \u2026 Plenty of people, especially in the north and centre of the country, are not busy with war; they&apos;re busy with starting businesses, getting scholarships, living life.&quot; We will occasionally stop and look at a photograph, mention it over dinner and maybe give it an award for excellent work. But the idea of staying focused on Afghanistan, despite its problems, doesn&apos;t find its way into the public debate any more. Any call for education, infrastructure, or security development initiatives would be condemned immediately; the mere publishing of these words will result in a barrage of angry comments. But Hossaini has no fear of such condemnation. He lives the reality of today&apos;s Afghanistan with the resolve that the world must know, even if it doesn&apos;t want to know. He runs towards danger and takes photos when others warn him not to: &quot;I travel throughout Afghanistan, I experience all the different cultures, I talk to people and share ideas to find out what is possible. I want to find a solution for our country. I want to see if there really is a solution for us.&quot; \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "sentences": ["Minutes later, they spilled out onto the streets of festive Amsterdam, having drinks and making dinner plans \u2013 not that attendees shouldn&apos;t do such a thing, but it illustrates our world&apos;s strange juxtapositions."], "title": "Massoud Hossaini's Pulitzer-winning photo: after the world stops looking | Mark Fonseca Rendeiro", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/24/massoud-hossaini-pulitzer-image-afghanistan", "tags": ["Afghanistan", "Photography", "World news", "Art and design", "South and Central Asia", "Awards and prizes", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-04-24T12:40:00Z", "article": "The French can be impatient \u2013 some internet users wanted to know the results of the presidential election&apos;s first round before they were officially disclosed at 8pm on Sunday \u2013 which goes against election laws. So just like General de Gaulle during the second world war, codes on Twitter were used with the hashtag #radiolondres to leak preliminary results that were available abroad (from 1940 to 1944, de Gaulle broadcast to his people on &quot;Radio Londres&quot;).  On va se faire un code. &quot;Le flan est au four&quot; \u00e7a veut dire Hollande au 2nd tour. &quot;La tomate est m\u00fbre&quot;, \u00e7a veut dire M\u00e9lenchon. \u2014 Guillaume Champeau (@gchampeau) April 18, 2012   &quot;We&apos;re going to use a code. &apos;Flan is in the oven&apos; means Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has reached the second round. &apos;Tomato is ripe&apos; means it&apos;s M\u00e9lenchon.&quot; Flan, or Flanby, a French flan brand, is a nickname for the Socialist candidate, mainly because of his shape.  After Guillaume Champeau, editor of tech website Numerama.com, published the above tweet , what started as a joke quickly picked up pace. Users began to play hide and seek with the authorities, using metaphors to reveal the results. The presidential campaign was boring. No wonder, then, that a lot of journalists and some canny web users found a way to spice things up at the very end. Code names were easy to guess: there was &quot;Hungary&quot; vs &quot;Netherlands&quot; (Nicolas Sarkozy&apos;s father is from Hungary, Hollande means Netherlands in English), &quot;Fouquet&apos;s&quot; (the expensive restaurant where Sarkozy had dinner after he won five years ago), &quot;dew&quot; for Hollande (ros\u00e9e in French, rose being the Socialist party&apos;s symbol), &quot;tomato&quot; for leftist Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, and &quot;green spring&quot; for Eva Joly: any symbol was a clue. Champeau was one of the first to tweet using the hashtag #RadioLondres. It read like poetry:    Le ciel bleu se couvre. La ros\u00e9e perle sur le jardin. #RadioLondres&mdash; Guillaume Champeau (@gchampeau) April 21, 2012    If you publish the results before 8pm on election night, you face a \u20ac75,000 fine \u2013 an investigation was opened late Sunday, with relevant authorities aiming to crack down on media agencies who allegedly broke the law; anyone tweeting the results with these code words could also have been sued by the national commission for electoral campaign (CNCCEP). But with the avalanche of messages posted between 6pm and 8pm, it could be tricky. French media journalist Emmanuel Berretta nonetheless said on his Twitter account that screen shots of culpable tweets were referred to the prosecutor&apos;s office on Monday. And yet, everyone was at it. Even French satirist Didier Porte \u2013 sacked from the radio station France Inter in 2010 because Sarkozy thought he was &quot;insulting, vulgar and nasty&quot; \u2013 sent a short message about Sarkozy&apos;s possible failure. Porte referred to the UMP poster in which Sarkozy stands in front of the Aegean Sea with the logo &quot;La France Forte&quot; (Hollande had said a few days earlier that Sarkozy &quot;would hit the wave&quot;).    #RadioLondres La vague est mont\u00e9e mais il a toujours pied, je r\u00e9p\u00e8te, la vague est mont\u00e9e mais il a toujours pied...&mdash; Didier Porte (@DidierPorte) April 22, 2012   Criticised for his personal &quot;bling-bling&quot; style during the last five years, our incumbent president&apos;s special shoes were also referred to:    Les talonnettes sont dans les cartons je r\u00e9p\u00e8te les talonnettes sont dans les cartons #radiolondres&mdash; Xavier Frison (@xfrison) April 21, 2012   Jokes were made about our first lady, who married Sarkozy only a few months after he was elected:    Carla Sarkozy serait sur le point de modifier son statut Facebook de \"Mari\u00e9e\" en \"C'est compliqu\u00e9\" #RadioLondres&mdash; Christophe Ginisty (@cginisty) April 22, 2012   We also discussed the weather. This tweet was published at 6:57pm, an hour before the first voting estimates were due to be published. Belgium and Switzerland had the results already via news websites, and any Twitter user could then link to it and invent a code to reveal the estimates:    Apparemment la m\u00e9t\u00e9o mondiale donne : 27\u00b0 \u00e0 Amsterdam, 26\u00b0 \u00e0 Budapest, 17\u00b0 \u00e0 Nuremberg, 14\u00b0 \u00e0 Cuba et 10\u00b0 \u00e0 Pau #RadioLondres&mdash; Hedia (@Hedia) April 22, 2012   (Nuremberg stands for the Front National leader Marine Le Pen, a reference to fascism; Budapest stood for Hungary, where Sarkozy&apos;s father is born; Cuba is communist and refers to leftist candidate M\u00e9lenchon; Pau is the city Bayrou comes from). We also used culinary metaphors \u2013 after all, we&apos;re French. M\u00e9lenchon was associated with tomatoes. The leftist known as the best orator of this campaign scored lower than expected.

Apple Q1 US smartphone market share 59%, v 36% year earlier &gt;&gt; Forbes  Based on the Q1 financial reports from Sprint, Verizon and AT&amp;T, Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt estimates that Apple had 59% of the U.S. smartphone market from the country&apos;s top three carriers in the quarter. That was up from 36% a year ago, although down a bit from 63% in the December quarter, a period in which Apple launched the iPhone 4S.  McCourt writes that non-iPhone smartphone sell-through appeared to drop 38% year-over-year, while iPhone sell-through grew 55%.   Very surprising. The graph suggests a leap in iPhone use that tallies with numbers that have come out recently, but still feels unexpected.

Digital Public Space: Data Guides &gt;&gt; BBC Internet Blog Mo McRoberts:   Last year, my colleagues in BBC Archive Development and I wrote some blog posts about the Digital Public Space project, which uses Semantic Web technology as a way to help unlock the value in the archives of the BBC and other publicly-funded institutions. Since those posts, our efforts have been focussed upon delivering the technology platform for a joint project with Arts Council England called &quot;The Space&quot; which will be available between May and October this year.

Apple = Sony &gt;&gt; Forrester Blogs George Colony:   Without knowing them personally, I would look to Apple executives Jon Ive or Scott Forstall to be CEO. From on far they appear to have some of the charisma and outspoken design sense to legitimately lead the company.  When Steve Jobs departed, he took three things with him: 1) singular charismatic leadership that bound the company together and elicited extraordinary performance from its people; 2) the ability to take big risks, and 3) an unparalleled ability to envision and design products. Apple&apos;s momentum will carry it for 24-48 months. But without the arrival of a new charismatic leader it will move from being a great company to being a good company, with a commensurate step down in revenue growth and product innovation.   There isn&apos;t the faintest chance that Ive will lead Apple; it&apos;s doubtful he even has that ambition. Forstall, however, has both the ambition, the ruthlessness and the vision (he was one of the two people who persuaded Jobs to let apps onto the iPhone. The other was Phil Schiller - another CEO candidate). The problem is, for that to happen, Cook would have to leave. Why or when would he do that?

The newly elected MP for Bradford West does not deny being a Muslim, but says Khan&apos;s claim of a conversion in a hotel in Kilburn, north-west London, is &quot;simply and categorically untrue&quot;. Galloway is often asked about his faith but refuses to answer, saying his religion is a &quot;personal matter&quot; of no import to his political activities. He recently married his fourth wife in what has been reported was a Muslim ceremony in Amsterdam. In a statement entitled &quot;The Staggers has fallen on its face&quot;, Galloway responded to the New Statesman piece by saying: &quot;The opening paragraph of Jemima Khan&apos;s piece in the New Statesman [referring to an alleged conversion ceremony] is totally untrue. Moreover, I told her it was fallacious when she put it to me. I have never attended any such ceremony in Kilburn, Karachi or Kathmandu. It is simply and categorically untrue.&quot; Khan&apos;s piece starts with the claim that Galloway converted at a ceremony attended by members of the Muslim Association of Britain. &quot;Those close to him know this. The rest of the world, including his Muslim constituents, does not,&quot; writes Khan. She goes on to describe Galloway&apos;s reaction when she told him someone she knew also attended the &quot;shahadah&quot; conversion ceremony, claiming he did not respond, instead staring at her across the table and then getting up to leave the interview. On Thursday, a spokesman for the Muslim Association of Britain said he had not heard of any such ceremony taking place in the presence of his members. Mohamed Kozbar, from the north London branch, said: &quot;I&apos;ve never heard anything about that. I don&apos;t know if George Galloway is a Muslim, but he is supportive of the Muslim community.&quot; In his rebuttal, Galloway accuses Khan of reporting &quot;deliberate falsehoods&quot; and making &quot;schoolgirl howlers which would earn banishment from a first-year journalism class&quot;. He said: &quot;For instance, she misspells the name of my &apos;glossy haired&apos; secretary, who is not my special assistant. Snidely, she claims that I have a slow and over-enunciated delivery \u2013 even then she failed to pick up the facts! \u2013 and, absurdly, says that&apos;s because I have a Glasgow accent which would require subtitles for those for whom English isn&apos;t a first language. Putting aside the regional and racial slurs and the cloth ear for accents, I&apos;m from Dundee! Which most of the rest of the world knows, but certainly the entire British press corps. I could go on.&quot; Galloway is demanding a retraction from the New Statesman. The New Statesman said in a statement: &quot;It is notable that Galloway does not deny being a Muslim convert \u2013 and he did not deny it when it was put to him at the time of the interview, which is on tape. Contrary to his press release, nor did he deny that the ceremony took place when it was put to him during the interview. This is also on tape. Furthermore, he failed to clarify how, by his own admission, he had a &quot;nikah&quot; (a Muslim marriage ceremony), despite the fact that a non-Muslim man cannot marry a Muslim woman under Islamic law. As for calling his &quot;secretary&quot; his &quot;special adviser&quot;, this is how she asked to be described in an email to Jemima Khan.&quot; Khan added: &quot;As for his Glasgow accent, he was MP for the city for 18 years, but if he disagrees that he picked up any inflection while there, we&apos;ll happily run a letter to that effect.&quot;", "sentences": ["He recently married his fourth wife in what has been reported was a Muslim ceremony in Amsterdam."], "title": "George Galloway denies Jemima Khan's claims of Muslim conversion ceremony", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/26/george-galloway-jemima-khan-muslim", "tags": ["George Galloway", "Jemima Khan", "New Statesman", "Islam", "Politics", "Religion", "Media", "UK news", "Newspapers & magazines", "Consumer magazines", "Magazines", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-04-26T13:40:00Z", "article": "1) An anniversary: Sonny Rollins&apos; The Bridge            This month marks 50 years since the release of Sonny Rollins&apos; 1962 album The Bridge, a milestone event that heralded the young New York saxophone master&apos;s comeback after a self-imposed three-year sabbatical. By departing the jazz scene so soon after fans and critics had fallen at his feet following breakout albums such as Saxophone Colossus (1956) and Way Out West (1957), Rollins \u2013 who was retreating to study, practice and deepen his art \u2013 was, with this album, previewing the wilful independence and creative perfectionism that would eventually make him the most famous surviving jazz saxophonist on the planet. The maestro&apos;s tireless ingenuity was recently endorsed by the organisers of the 2012 London Jazz Festival, who last month announced that the 81-year-old will headline the 10-day festival with a gig at the Barbican on 16 November. Some have speculated that Rollins was intimidated by an eruption of new creativity around him in 1959 (from Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman, Charles Mingus, or his own tenor-sax heir John Coltrane, for starters). But the man himself has simply pointed out he&apos;d been hailed as the new Charlie Parker too early, and all the acclaim risked hardening his style into a signature sound before he&apos;d properly explored alternatives. That was the impulse that brought the three years of privacy and practice, culminating in the making of The Bridge \u2013 so named because Rollins had wanted space to stretch his big sound and bigger imagination, and had taken to practising in the open, on the Lower East Side&apos;s Williamsburg Bridge. 2) A rising star: Tineke Postma            Fast forward to 2002. On the other side of the city, at the Manhattan School of Music, a Dutch sax student called Tineke Postma was on an exchange programme from the conservatory of Amsterdam. Postma, who played a typically characterful show with her own quartet at London&apos;s Pizza Express Jazz Club earlier this month, doesn&apos;t mimic Sonny Rollins or anyone else. At 33, she&apos;s a mature player with her own sound. But the American jazz baton has been passed to her by teachers intimately linked to Rollins and his postwar New York circle. Her American teachers included Dave Liebman and Chris Potter, two contemporary jazz stars steeped in the sax legacy Rollins inherited from Coleman Hawkins and Charlie Parker, and which he would in turn hand on to Coltrane. Moreover, Liebman, Potter and Postma herself (in common with contemporary jazz players all over the globe), are also highly original interpreters of the unique themes of the late Thelonious Monk, who was a childhood friend of Rollins in the 40s and a big influence on his musical thinking. As a formally educated, musically eclectic 21st-century woman carving a career in what, for decades, was almost exclusively a man&apos;s world, Postma certainly inhabits a very different jazz landscape to that of Rollins&apos; youth \u2013 but their roots are entwined just the same.  Here&apos;s Postma demonstrating those connections with the help of an even bigger female jazz star, 2011 Grammy winner Esperanza Spalding, who comes to the UK with her own band in May. The clip is from Postma&apos;s Pablo Neruda adaptation Leave Me A Place Underground, featured on last year&apos;s The Dawn of Light.  3) From across the pond: the New York Standards Quartet            This month has also seen a big, UK-wide tour by a contemporary band whose own New York connections are evident: its core membership is based there, and it even names itself after the place. The New York Standards Quartet, a subtly unorthodox group that includes Gene Jackson, a former Herbie Hancock sideman, in its drum chair, was invited to the UK by London-resident US bass player Mike Janisch. On the face of it, the NYSQ does what jazz musicians have been doing since the 1930s: takes Broadway show tunes and pop songs and improvises on their harmonies. But they take the process a few deconstructionist steps further, and sometimes hide famous tunes so deviously the penny only drops when they get to the end. For all their tune bending, the NYSQ are far from jazz revolutionaries. But saxophonist Tim Armacost and superb pianist David Berkman exhibit a thoughtful lyricism, and it grows on you; in live performance, it sometimes emits an unexpectedly intense heat. Here&apos;s the lineup (with original bassist Yosuke Inoue rather than Mike Janisch) on All The Things You Are, a classic they explored with a similar Latin twist on the recent tour. 4) Reinventing the classics the Corea/Burton way            The glitteringly skilful duo comprising pianist Chick Corea and vibraphonist Gary Burton have been working together for 40 years. They also did their own kind of standards-bending and classic-pop manipulation this month, in particular by including the Beatles&apos; Eleanor Rigby in a programme that, on their new album Hot House, sits alongside evergreens by Dave Brubeck, Jobim, and Kurt Weill, among others. Burton and Corea know so many ways around their respective instruments and each other&apos;s quirks that hearing them together can feel like eavesdropping on a private conversation, as John Lewis observed of their April London concert. But it can still be a fascinating process to witness. 5) In memory: Tony Marsh, and other jazz greats            One of Gary Burton&apos;s pioneering predecessors on the vibraphone was Teddy Charles, an innovative musician who worked with Davis, Parker and Mingus before swapping the choppy waters of jazz for a life as a charter-boat skipper in the Caribbean. On 16 April, Charles died in New York aged 84. The British jazz world suffered its own sad losses: the deaths of pianist and influential educator Pete Saberton, aged 61, and, on Easter Monday, the imaginatively provocative percussionist Tony Marsh, who was 72. Marsh could anticipate what improvisers were going to do next with an accuracy bordering on the telepathic, and was a selflessly attentive ensemble player in no-holds-barred improv bands (most notably free-sax giant Evan Parker), theme-playing orthodox groups, and outfits leaning toward contemporary classical music. Tributes to Marsh are steadily finding their way on to the web, but here&apos;s a graceful example of his artistry, from the Cafe Oto in October 2010, on a tribute to the memory of an earlier British jazz legend, trumpeter Harry Beckett. Marsh and other former Beckett sidemen Chris Biscoe (sax), Alastair Gavin (piano) and Fred Thelonious Baker (bass) are joined on a couple of typical Beckett originals by trumpeter Henry Lowther, gracefully taking the absent composer&apos;s parts.", "sentences": ["On the other side of the city, at the Manhattan School of Music, a Dutch sax student called Tineke Postma was on an exchange programme from the conservatory of Amsterdam."], "title": "Take five: John Fordham's month in jazz \u2013 April", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/26/john-fordham-month-jazz-april", "tags": ["Jazz", "Music"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-04-26T17:14:20Z", "article": "Roberto Di Matteo must be pinching himself. Sacked by West Bromwich Albion in February of last year, turned down by Birmingham City, who preferred Chris Hughton, he was still out of work 10 months ago. Yet in three weeks&apos; time he will become the 10th Italian coach to lead a team into the European Cup final, and victory in Munich would put him alongside Nereo Rocco, Giovanni Trapattoni, Arrigo Sacchi, Fabio Capello, Marcello Lippi and Carlo Ancelotti: just about as august a gathering as could be imagined. Can these things really be happening to him? Best of all, perhaps, he can travel to Bavaria knowing that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will not be lying in wait. For Di Matteo and his team, the psychological effect of confronting the man who had Chelsea under his spell for three incomparably dramatic seasons, and who still retains the loyalty and affection of some of his former players and most of the club&apos;s fans, could hardly be exaggerated. Were they having to face Real Madrid on 19 May, Mourinho would loom as a more significant figure even than Cristiano Ronaldo or Iker Casillas. But now he is out of the picture, last seen watching Wednesday&apos;s penalty shootout while kneeling on the Bernab\u00e9u touchline before disappearing down the tunnel in the wake of defeat. We can be sorry, of course, because any contest between Chelsea and a team managed by Mourinho contains a special charge of electricity, but from Di Matteo&apos;s perspective it removes an unhealthy distraction. There will be no back-page headlines proclaiming Frank Lampard&apos;s undimmed admiration for the Portuguese provocateur. Instead Chelsea will face Bayern, four-times winners of the competition, now led by Jupp Heynckes, the 66-year-old veteran of West Germany&apos;s 1972 European Championship-winning team. As a striker for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Hannover 96, Heynckes scored 220 league goals between 1963 and 1978, putting him third in the Bundesliga&apos;s all-time list, behind his contemporaries Gerd M\u00fcller and Klaus Fischer. As a coach his 33-year career has taken him to clubs in Germany, Spain and Portugal, including three spells with Bayern, the first of them highlighted by league titles in 1988-89 and 1989-90. With Real Madrid he won the European Cup in 1997-98, thanks to Predrag Mijatovic&apos;s goal against Juventus in Amsterdam. He rejoined Bayern last summer, and he already knows that, with two matches to go, his team are destined to finish second behind the defending champions, Borussia Dortmund, and will not regain the title they have won five times in the last 10 years. But to capture the European Cup for the first time since 2001\u2013 itself the first victory since the club&apos;s hat-trick in the mid-1970s \u2013 would be more than enough to spread contentment through a club whose ownership is structured in a manner as far from that of Chelsea&apos;s single-owner model as could be imagined. Bayern&apos;s 160,000 members own 84% of the company&apos;s shares, while the remainder is split between two German firms, Adidas and Audi, who put up the money to build the Allianz Arena. Distinguished former players, notably Franz Beckenbauer, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeness (the current president), are closely involved in the club&apos;s governance. It is a formula that clearly works: despite low membership fees and affordable ticket prices, last year Bayern were rated the fourth richest club in the world by the annual Deloitte survey. Heynckes&apos;s team joined this season&apos;s Champions League in the play-off round, where they overcame FC Z\u00fcrich before topping a tough group including Manchester City, Napoli and Villarreal, losing only to City when the outcome was already settled and half a dozen first-choice players could be left on the bench. Basel, conquerors of Manchester United, were dismissed in the round of 16 before Marseille were beaten home and away in the quarter-finals. Then came the two intense and thrilling matches against Real Madrid, in which Bayern proved themselves a more compact, crafty and consistent team than the star-studded heirs of the nine-times winners. Like Chelsea, Bayern will suffer from the effect of yellow cards awarded in the second leg of the semi-finals, with suspensions costing them the presence of the centre-back Holger Badstuber, the Brazilian defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo and the dynamic Austrian left-back David Alaba. Rafinha, a Brazilian right-back, may come in, with the captain, Philipp Lahm, switching to the left, as he has often done in the past. The Belgian defender Daniel Van Buyten, once briefly of Manchester City, could be restored to the team in place of Badstuber, or Heynckes may prefer Breno, a 22-year-old Brazilian central defender with a poor disciplinary record on and off the pitch. Anatoliy Tymoshchuk, the experienced Ukraine midfielder, is the most obvious replacement for Gustavo as a second screening player alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger, although Thomas M\u00fcller offers a more adventurous alternative. The changes may mean that they are not as defensively sound as they were in the semi-final but the same prediction may be made of Chelsea&apos;s reshuffled rearguard. Then there is Bayern&apos;s home advantage. Real Madrid in 1957 and Internazionale in 1965 both made the most of playing a European Cup final in their own stadium while Roma fell to Liverpool on their own pitch in 1984. The lusty support of Bayern fans gathering from all over Germany in a glittering modern ground holding almost 70,000 could be counterbalanced by the dragging weight of expectation and the fear of repeating the disappointment of two years ago, when they fell to Mourinho&apos;s Inter in Madrid. History and form must favour the German club, for whom a victory would condemn their opponents to becoming the Premier League&apos;s sixth beaten finalists in the past seven finals of the competition: a remarkable statistic, if not a wholly enviable one. For Chelsea, whose owner grew up in a communist state but now embodies the rewards of unbridled capitalism, never has the advice of Antonio Gramsci, the great Marxist intellectual, seemed more appropriate: pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will. It has done them well so far.", "sentences": ["With Real Madrid he won the European Cup in 1997-98, thanks to Predrag Mijatovic&apos;s goal against Juventus in Amsterdam."], "title": "Bayern Munich take long road to final where history awaits | Richard Williams", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/apr/26/bayern-munich-final-chelsea-history", "tags": ["Bayern Munich", "Chelsea", "Champions League 2011-12", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-04-27T09:04:36Z", "article": "On 15 October 1968 in Mexico City\u2019s Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Universitario, David Hemery inspired the BBC\u2019s incomparable David Coleman to the zenith of his facility for conveying his exhilaration at British success in the sport he cherished above all others \u2013 and in that elation also to commit a faux pas for which he quickly apologised but nonetheless spawned a tradition for ruthlessly lampooning commentary gaffes that reached its peak the following decade when Private Eye launched Colemanballs.   Related: 16 October 1968: David Hemery hurdles into history in Mexico    As the tall, blond 400m hurdler extended his fluent, graceful stride up the home straight, Coleman\u2019s excitement was palpable and infectious but any analysis of the words he used indicates that the delivery at immortal moments such as these is far more significant than the content. \u201cAnd it\u2019s David Hemery in the lead for Great Britain,\u201d Coleman said, his voice rapidly increasing in tone and speed like a plane hurtling down the runway beyond the point of no return before take-off. \u201cIt\u2019s Hemery Great Britain, it\u2019s Hemery Great Britain, it\u2019s Hemery with one barrier to go,\u201d he continued. And then his pitch soared even more: \u201cAnd David Hemery is going to take the gold. David Hemery wins for Britain! Hemery takes the gold, in second place Hennige and who cares who\u2019s third? It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d It did matter, of course, because the identity of the man who won bronze was Britain\u2019s other finalist, John Sherwood, the husband of Sheila Sherwood who had won the silver medal in the long jump the day before. But Coleman\u2019s instinctive relegation of Sherwood\u2019s achievement was not malicious in spirit and wholly forgivable given the circumstances. The men finishing in third, fourth, fifth and sixth were separated by only a tenth of a second and the first three of them were awarded the same time. When the slow motion replay demonstrated that Sherwood had taken third place ahead of the USA\u2019s world-record holder Geoffrey Vanderstock, Coleman paid the Yorkshireman a generous tribute. Before he made amends to Sherwood though, Coleman finished his race commentary. \u201cHemery won it all the way,\u201d he enthused. \u201cHemery won that from start to finish. He killed the rest. He paralysed them.\u201d His margin of victory was more than eight metres, he set a new world record and he became the first Briton to win the event dubbed \u201cthe mankiller\u201d since David George Brownlow Cecil, Lord Burghley, had set an Olympic record in the final in the Amsterdam Games in 1928. In a felicitous coincidence Cecil, who by then had succeeded his father to become the sixth Marquess of Exeter, led the official party and honoured Hemery by hanging the gold medal around his neck. In 1936 Burghley, in full evening dress, had completed a 400-yard lap of the Queen Mary in 57 seconds and from 1943-45 served as the Governor of Bermuda. How Hemery, the man with the sixth fastest personal best among the eight finalists, came to be on top of the podium, also owed a debt to a visit to Bermuda and to a happy transatlantic accordance, this one between two extraordinary and complementary coaches who, though they were based more than 3,000 miles apart and who were to meet only once \u2013 on the eve of the 1972 Games \u2013 moulded a champion and one of the greatest performances in Olympic history. Hemery was brought up in Frinton on Sea on the Essex coast in the late 1940s and early 50s. His father had been the New South Wales schoolboy long jump champion but his membership of what his son called \u201ca narrow religious sect\u201d proscribed continuing with athletics and on his return to Britain, which he had left at the age of two, he established himself in private practice as a chartered accountant. From Hemery\u2019s descriptions, he and his three siblings enjoyed an idyllically sporty childhood, his father building goals, cricket nets and high jump stands in the family\u2019s back garden. There were also, he wrote in his autobiography, \u201coccasional swims in the freezing North Sea, long walks on the high sea wall and standing long jumps from it to the beach below [which] provided considerable physical activity\u201d. The defining moment in his life came when he was 12 in 1957 and his father was offered a job in Colorado Springs. The Hemery children were consulted about the move and, after deciding to go, stayed there for six months before his father accepted another position in Boston. The four children \u2013 Judy, David, John and Anthea \u2013 were enrolled at Thayer Academy in Braintree, Massachusetts and the boys excelled in sport, David becoming an accomplished miler, half-miler and prolific centre-forward in the soccer team. \u201cIn 1961,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmy father decided that the school should have hurdles. Without too much thought of whether he could afford such generosity, he donated a complete set. He had no idea what this gift was to reap. Perhaps because of my time at Frinton, where I had hurdled over breakwaters on the beach at five, I took to hurdling like a duck to water.\u201d When he graduated from Thayer in 1962 he was awarded a prize for being the school\u2019s best all-round sportsman but in his only year as a high hurdler felt that he never mastered the discipline, recording 16.5sec as his personal best. In June that year the family returned to England, moving to Moor Park in Hertfordshire where David joined Ruislip &amp; Northwood Athletics Club (which became Hillingdon AC in 1966 when it merged with Finchley Harriers). When Hemery\u2019s father inquired about a hurdles coach, David was sent to Hurlingham Park track in Putney to meet Fred Housden. Housden had been a scrum-half for Blackheath, an international pole vaulter and high hurdler before the 1914-18 war and after Cambridge had taught mathematics at Harrow until his retirement in the early 1950s. When Hemery met him, the coach was 70 and immediately began to address the athlete\u2019s flaw, \u201cfloating in space\u201d over hurdles instead of maintaining his forward momentum. They worked for three evenings a week over the summer of 1962 while Hemery spent the weekdays employed by the National Westminster Bank. He spent hours practicing starts, adjusted his technique and built up leg-strength. His times for the 120-yard high hurdles began to demonstrate a dramatic improvement, falling from 15.6sec over 3ft 3in barriers to 14.7sec over 3ft 6in hurdles. In the AAA Indoor Championships at Wembley he won the Wall\u2019s Trophy for the best performance for an athlete aged 21 or under but towards the end of the year the family had decided to return to the United States. \u201cNeither John nor Anthea could settle in England at that time,\u201d he wrote of his two younger siblings. \u201cThey had picked up American accents and were told \u2018go home Yank\u2019 and made to feel distinctly unwanted. Their American friends and the informal student-teacher relationships in the States made them long for that side of the pond.\u201d But when they arrived back in Boston, the job his father had understood to be guaranteed fell through and the family received a further setback when they were scammed into investing in \u201cphony\u201d scheme. David worked for the next 18 months in the computer department of the National Shawmut Bank, chipping his income into the family pool while his father built up a new private practice from scratch. A year later he took a holiday with his brother to Bermuda during \u201ccollege week\u201d and found the contrast between the students\u2019 outlook and his own a shock. He felt \u201calmost like a 40-year-old banker\u201d, he said, and it made him consider his future. His propensity for hard work, study and his determination to better himself had already led to evening courses in banking, now he decided to catch up on his lost two years by applying to Boston University, where he was accepted on an engineering degree course and found Billy Smith, the coach of the university\u2019s track team who was a friend of his high school coach. At college he made swift progress as a member of the one-mile relay team and over a varying hurdles distances from 50 to 600 yards. With Housden focusing on technique, Smith worked on strength and stamina in a regime that often included 30 100-yard dashes, a seven-mile run and ended with seven 220-yard sprints. He amassed victories throughout his freshman and sophomore years and during his senior year gave this snapshot of Smith\u2019s dedication and philosophy. \u201cOne day a blizzard started at about noon. By 3pm quite a lot of snow had fallen and it was still coming down. I asked [Billy] what he thought I should do \u2013 weight training and/or a few exercises or should I take the day off? He paused, then pushing the door open, said: \u2018Out there is the road to Mexico.\u2019\u201d So Hemery went outside and pounded out a series of half-miles on the boards while Smith stood at the side of the track, ankle-deep in snow. In the summer of 1966 he returned to England to compete and train under Housden, running 14.3sec to win the inter-counties championship high hurdles. Picked for Great Britain he won the same race in a meet against the USSR and became Commonwealth Games champion over the 3ft 6in barriers in Jamaica. Later that year he decided to focus on the 440-yard discipline, running a variety of 600- and 500-yard races at indoor meets during the winter season but tore his left hamstring on his return to the high hurdles in February 1967. He attempted comebacks every couple of weeks but repeatedly broke down when lengthening his jog to a stride. In the end Smith told him to rest until August to allow it to heal properly and he had to sit out the European summer season. In August he resumed training on the sand bar at Powder Point, beginning slowly but gaining in confidence as his leg withstood gradual accelerations of pace. Over the winter he concentrated on stamina work in cross country races, indoors over 600 yards in the hurdles and anchoring the mile-relay on the flat. On 10 April 1968 in his first outdoors meeting of the season Hemery equalled his personal best 51.8sec in the 440-yard hurdles and nine days later set a new British record of 50.7. In May he won the 120-yard and 440-yard hurdles at the New England Championships and in June the longer race at the National Collegiates in Berkeley, California breaking the tape from lane one in his best yet, 49.8. \u201cUnbeaten and in first-class condition,\u201d Hemery wrote, \u201cBilly Smith handed me on to Fred Housden.\u201d Back in England and based at his brother\u2019s flat near Crystal Palace, Hemery began further technical work at the athletics stadium to iron out the remaining glitch with his stride pattern. \u201c I take 13 strides between the intermediate hurdles,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo one can run at full speed for long, no matter how fit he is. As a consequence of slowing down one\u2019s stride length becomes shorter. In order to clear a hurdle fast and smoothly, an athlete must take off an exact distance from the barrier. At some point in the race therefore an extra stride or two must go in between each set of hurdles. One extra, and the hurdler must take off from his other leg; two extra and he will be leaping from the same leg. My hurdling was less than adequate from my left leg. I therefore had to go for two extra, that is, 15 strides from about halfway through the race.\u201d With the refinement underway Hemery won the AAA Championships over 440 yards at White City to qualify for the Olympic Games and moved on to hill work. Four weeks before the Games opened he flew to Mexico City with the other members of the British team selected for the 400m and longer distances to acclimatize to the altitude and was there when the Mexican army massacred protestors in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas 10 days before the opening ceremony. Despite numerous protests that the Games should not go ahead, the International Olympic Committee refused to bow to pressure. In the athletes village and on the practice tracks, Hemery\u2019s body slowly began to get used to the paucity of oxygen. In the dormitory, he devoted himself to study, poring over his training diary, drawing pictures of the track and writing down exactly what he wanted to accomplish in the heats, semi-final and final. In the run-up to competing, Hemery received letters from both Housden and Smith. The former, as was his custom, wrote in verse, referencing the two USA runners, Geoff Vanderstock and Ron Whitney, who were ranked No1 and 2 in the world, and the work they had done in mastering the change down to 15 strides between hurdles: \u201cWhen others quail And Geoff looks pale And Ronnie\u2019s knees are quaking. Then is the time To heed my rhyme And take to record making. You know the point Where out of joint Your chopping may go wonky, So don\u2019t lose speed But keep the lead, Each clearance honky-tonky.\u201d Smith was equally positive, accurately predicting: \u201cYou\u2019ll run 48.1sec or 48.2 and no one else can do that. The others are 1,000 hills and sand dunes behind you and it is too late to catch up. Your preparation has been perfect. It seems like we\u2019ve been through and over this whole thing 100 times \u2013 but we know we\u2019re right. We might be the only two people in the world to know it but it is true.\u201d His plan for the heat was merely to qualify for the semi-final and relax into the groove of 15 strides between hurdles after 200m. This he did, but not without a scare when he looked behind him after clearing the last hurdle to see three competitors closing in on him. He finished second in 50.3sec. In one of the other heats Whitney ran 49sec dead and tried to psyche out everyone else in the competition with his nonchalance, barely exhaling with any conspicuous strenuous effort and waving to the crowd. Hemery was drawn in lane six in his semi, with Whitney in the lane outside him, and the American again came home first with Gerhrad Hennige second and the Briton third. In the other race Sherwood set a new Commonwealth record of 49.3sec, also to finish third. The day of the final was wet and cold. Hemery and Sherwood were taken to the stadium two hours before the race in case of traffic congestion and took refuge in the British team\u2019s medical room, lying on the cot beds under grey blankets for warmth as the national coach, Denis Watts, and Great Britain\u2019s silver medallist at Tokyo, John Cooper, chain-smoked. They tried to crack jokes but Hemery recalled the tension \u2013 and the blanket \u2013 brought him out into a cold sweat. The natural inclination was to start their warm-ups, just to allow them the comfort of something to take their minds off the race, but knew that they had to conserve their energy until as late as possible. \u201cMy fingers and feet were damp and freezing cold,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI felt weak, my breath was short and I felt a slight constriction in my throat. The back of my neck ached a bit and my prevailing thoughts were of impending unpleasantness.\u201d With 50 minutes to go they headed to the warm-up track and Hemery took off his shoes to jog on the grass. The feeling of the wet surface conjured up a mental picture of his training on the sand at Powder Point and the enthusiasm and vigour he experienced there when he was returning from injury the year before. When they finally made their way into the stadium to register their vest numbers, they were made to wait in the pen for 10 minutes. As the other finalists began to shake their limbs and jog the eight-yard length of the cage to warm up, Hemery laid down on a bench. Finally they were allowed on to the track, checked their blocks, practised a start, hyperventilated to draw as much oxygen as they could into their lungs, stripped off their tracksuits and waited for the starter to whistle. In lane six again, Hemery took a few strides out of his blocks on the command of \u201cstand-up, please\u201d after a false-start outside him. They waited for the gun the second time and Hemery found his rhythm from the start. \u201cFirst hurdle came spot on,\u201d he remembered. \u201cFast and relaxed.\u201d By the third hurdle he had passed Whitney in lane seven and only Sherwood in lane eight remained in his vision. After the sixth hurdle, when he changed to 15 strides, he lost sight of his compatriot so for the last 190m he was running blind. \u201cI started to question whether it would be possible to maintain so much effort and not die before the end,\u201d he said. \u201cFor one step my pace eased but instantly a flash came through my mind, \u2018this is the Olympic final \u2013 you can\u2019t let up now\u2019.\u201d On he went, panicking when he heard a foot splash, which he estimated to be very close to him on his left. Smith had told him to \u201cgo at the last hurdle as if it were the first of a 110m spring hurdle race\u201d but only remembered the advice after he had cleared it. Even so he managed to change gear into a sprint for the final 45m. He dipped at the line but because he had not looked to his left over the last metres was not wholly convinced that someone had not passed him on the inside. It was only when he saw a BBC camera crew racing towards him that he became convinced that he had won. And not just won, but thrashed the field in 48.12sec, to take the world record by eight-tenths of a second. \u201cI believe,\u201d wrote the Times\u2019s correspondent Neil Allen the next day, \u201cthis was the outstanding British athletics performance of all time.\u201d Afterwards Hemery said that he had \u201crun scared\u201d for 48.1sec. Among all his other achievements that day was that never for a second did his demeanour betray anything other than supreme talent, confidence and judgment. What the Guardian said The Guardian, October 16 1968 Dave Hemery, aged 24, brought Britain her first gold medal of the Olympics here this evening with a performance that staggered the crowd and left his rivals shattered. He won the 400 metres hurdles in 41.8sec, slicing the phenomenal amount of seven-tenths of a second off the world record by Geoff Vanderstock (America) one of those left in the wake. Hemery won the race by 12 yards and one of the first men to congratulate him was Lord Exeter who last won this Olympic title for Britain in Amsterdam in 1928.   Related: Kendra Harrison sets 100m hurdles world record at Anniversary Games    Hemery, out of the American mould of hurdlers \u2013 he has been studying at Boston University \u2013 led all the way. He went into the second flight just ahead, pushed hard down the back straight and for a few moments just before he had to change from 13 strides between hurdles to 15 strides, I feared he had overdone things. But rather than lose ground he gained it and along the straight Hemery, perfection at every obstacle, was out on his own while the rest panted and struggled for minor prizes. At the finish Hemery was in no way distressed. He nodded and raised his hand to salute the crowd as though he knew it was going to happen. The evening was chill and damp \u2013 it was the weather for the British not the Americans nor the Italians. And the performance of Hemery showed too how much he has been keeping secret during the early rounds of the competition. It was a barely credible performance. Something to rank along with Herb Elliott\u2019s 1,500 metres win in the Rome Olympics and with the two medal-winning performances of Peter Snell in Tokyo. No words are too great in praise of this performance. What happened next Hemery never quite reached the heights of Mexico 68 again, although he did win silver in the 4x400m relay and bronze in the 400m hurdles in the Munich Games four years later.

Miss Prism is a Teutonophile composer as well as a sentimental novelist. Algernon and Jack duet sweetly to a splintered, expressionist-style &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;. Cecily and Gwendolen converse through megaphones, throw at least 40 dinner plates and shoot each other. Apart from that, all achieved through musical suggestion rather than verbal perversion, Gerald Barry&apos;s operatic version of Wilde&apos;s 1895 farce The Importance of Being Earnest remains intact. The text has been shorn by the composer \u2013 losing about two thirds \u2013 but the best jokes are still there, from a collective manic obsession with cucumber sandwiches to that dangerously over-exciting topic, the fall of the rupee. Barry (b 1952), who has always freewheeled joyfully and devilishly, ignoring rules, fashion or sensible career signposts, has come of age \u2013 he was 60 yesterday \u2013 with his fourth opera, first seen in Los Angeles last year and given its European premiere at the Barbican (and in Birmingham) by the virtuosic Birmingham Contemporary Music Group. Thomas Ad\u00e8s conducted with a composer&apos;s understanding, clockwork precision and combustive flair. The musical variety and expertise of the cast, not least the exceptional Barbara Hannigan leaping nimbly up to top Ds as the winsome Cecily, provided enough action in this concert performance to keep you gripped. The music, as anyone who has encountered Barry&apos;s glittering, sharp-edged work will know, combines absurdity with grand statement, mosaic-like borrowings with reinvention, rhythmic regularity with harmonic anarchy. Trills en masse, multiple glissades of scales, chord clusters and strange, tipsy serenades of low brass and woodwind colour the score. Schoenberg&apos;s Five Pieces for Orchestra are pilfered for bathos, Beethoven&apos;s Ode to Joy for \u2013 of all things \u2013 wit, Scottish folk song for good measure. This aural roll, pitch and yaw are as bewildering to the ears as a motion simulator to the brain: you respond to every gravitational force only to find it was illusory after all. No doubt those who stormed out of the successful LA premiere, or the noisy grumbler a few rows behind me at the Barbican, may not have realised that the shrill, fragmented vocal lines were pastiche serialism. Barry, who studied with Stockhausen as well as that unmatched musical humorist, Mauricio Kagel, knows what he is doing. He has spoken of giving Wilde a Pinteresque makeover. He has, and it works. The music smiles scurrilously; the audience laughs back. The handbag moment, lest you wonder, had Alan Ewing (Lady Bracknell) exhaling with sprechstimme angst. In a strong ensemble, Peter Tantsits (John Worthing) negotiated his hysterical vocal contortions with aplomb and Hilary Summers revelled in the prunes and prismatics of the governess. Wilde wrote Importance, his last play, at the peak of his career. Even as it was being staged he was staring, or being made by others to stare, into that moral abyss hinted at in the play. Weeks later he was in prison. &quot;The starry heavens above me, and the moral law within me.&quot; This was the\u00a0paraphrase of Kant which Beethoven scribbled down when he was working on the Missa Solemnis Op\u00a0123. It sums up the dichotomy in this transcendent masterpiece in which martial horror and celestial hope are enveloped in an outpouring of near-impossible choral music and extreme contrasts of mood, register and style. If a performance does not blitz the nervous system it has flunked. Fortunately with Nikolaus Harnoncourt conducting the\u00a0Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam and the Netherlands Radio Choir, this account was pulverising as well as revelatory. Nothing was predictable. The opening Kyrie was expansive, the enormous Credo a series of ascents and descents culminating in the explosive &quot;Et vitam venturi&quot; fugue, the sinewy violin solo in the Sanctus emerging from dark, murky string depths which might have expressed the early stirrings of Chaos itself. The Agnus Dei, with its dry, death-rattle drum rolls (played using wooden-headed sticks) and barely controlled outbursts of &quot;Miserere&quot;, made a shattering impact. The soloists, Marlis Petersen, Elisabeth Kulman, Werner G\u00fcra and Gerald Finley, had exactly the right relationship to choir and orchestra, soaring as if carried aloft by the surrounding singers and players. The 74-strong professional choir, which together with most Dutch arts organisations is facing cuts of up to 50 per cent and a threatened loss of numbers, was alert and accurate. Afterwards, Harnoncourt was awarded the Royal Philharmonic Society gold medal, first struck in 1870 in honour of Beethoven&apos;s centenary and wholly deserved. The illustrious Concertgebouw&apos;s three-concert Barbican residency continues with an all-Richard Strauss programme with Mariss Jansons on 12 May and Bruckner&apos;s Symphony No 5 with Bernard Haitink on 20 May. In his compulsion to push music to the limits of human endeavour, Beethoven would have empathised with Conlon Nancarrow (1912-97), the American innovator and friend of John Cage who was the subject of the Impossible Brilliance weekend at the Southbank, of which I heard a representative fraction. A charismatic figure with a cult following, who fought in the Spanish civil war and then left anti-communist America to live in Mexico City, Nancarrow wrote most of his music for the mechanical player piano, punching his compositions out as holes into rolls of paper. The result was a series of spangling pieces, unplayable by even the best musician, dense with canons, logarithmic-based speed relationships \u2013 sensed, if not necessarily perceived by the listener \u2013 and a riotous splash of boogie-woogie and other jazz-inspired effects. In his Study for Player Piano No 25 the final 12 seconds contain 1,028 notes, which gives you an idea. If the interpreter is all but redundant, Nancarrow&apos;s work nevertheless requires musical mechanics of formidable dexterity. Rex\u00a0Lawson, he of the navel-length beard, has been keeper of the pianola flame for the past 30 years and compares it, broadly, to controlling a car&apos;s windscreen wipers. If it were that easy, Nancarrow would be on every concert schedule. Long live Mr Lawson, as well as the London Sinfonietta, with conductor Baldur Br\u00f6nnimann playing arrangements by Nancarrow devotee Yvar Mikhashoff, and the Arditti Quartet, all brilliant and\u00a0loving exponents. Friendship saved the memory of Ivor Gurney, soldier, poet and composer, who spent his final years in a mental hospital in Dartford. His work might have been lost without the efforts of the musicologist Marion Scott and the composer Gerald Finzi. Seventy-five years after Gurney&apos;s death, interest has never been greater. His singular talent, in which pastoral idyll and trench warfare fuse in short, potent lyricism, is at last being appreciated. In A Soldier and a Maker, an amalgam of songs, poems and archival material devised by Iain Burnside, students from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama tell Gurney&apos;s poignant story, from his early years as the misunderstood son of a Gloucester tailor, to mustard-gas attack on the Somme, to the tortured asylum years. Nineteen performers, including pianists Justin Snyder and Gavin Roberts, shared the roles of family, musicians, soldiers and medical staff. Ex-Guildhall actor Richard Goulding played Gurney, tenderly negotiating the shadowlands between sanity and madness. Jennie Witton, Bethan Langford, Samuel Smith, Alex Knox and, as the querulous composer Herbert Howells, Nicholas Allen led a\u00a0versatile cast.

John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson are rolling through the streets of LA discussing the former&apos;s recent trip to Amsterdam. With schoolboy glee, Travolta&apos;s character enumerates the freedoms of the hash bars there. &quot;I&apos;m going, that&apos;s all there is to it,&quot; Jackson grins. These are experienced murderers, remember. They have large quantities of first-rate heroin conveniently at hand. And yet they gasp at the very idea of a place where you can smoke a joint unpunished. This neatly summarises the appeal of the Netherlands&apos; cannabis cafes, which, if new laws come into force as planned, will soon be closed to tourists. Following a challenge by cafe owners, a judge in The Hague has now decided that such legislation does not break EU rules. This means that, from next Tuesday, it will take effect in three southern provinces before being extended nationally at the end of the year. Setting aside the domestic consequences, which are debatable, this will be no great loss to foreigners. In truth, Britain and much of the developed world is already one large cannabis cafe. If you doubt this, take some money to the nearest place where you might imagine finding dealers, ask anybody you see who looks as though they know a few, and within minutes you will find you own some cannabis, to do with as you wish. The chances of anybody stopping you are almost negligible, as are the chances of being punished if they do. A &quot;cannabis warning&quot;, with no fine or criminal record, is the most likely outcome for a first offence. This involves a policeman taking away your cannabis and telling you not to do it again. Or, should such mild peril still alarm you, you can always grow your own. Guidance and equipment are easily available. There are 58 hydroponics shops in Birmingham alone. Add all this up, and it is hard to believe that many people visit the Netherlands because they can&apos;t get weed at home. Rather, as with Jules and Vincent in Pulp Fiction, it is not the actual freedoms of Dutch hash bars that excite the tourists, so much as the spectacle of them. And the experience itself is seldom wonderful. Typically \u2013 from the many stories I have heard \u2013 you arrive excited, giggle over the &quot;menu&quot; and then almost immediately, no matter which variety you choose, get so splatted that you can barely speak for hours. Remembering these warnings on my only visit about a decade ago, I ordered the tamest thing I could find (which still wasn&apos;t very tame) in spite of the proprietor&apos;s derision. Beyond just sanctioning a fairly harmless practice, in other words, cannabis liberalisation has also established the Netherlands as a novelty to gawp at. The country&apos;s laws are not unique \u2013 Portugal, for example, has abolished criminal penalties in all drug possession cases, with great success \u2013 but the reputation sticks.

Most of the Labour supporters I know regard George Galloway as something between a snake and a toad, and his recent victory a dark day for democracy. I don&apos;t know if this makes me more frivolous than them, or perhaps just less tribal, but for the life of me I\u00a0cannot see it that way, Westminster being short on electrifyingly fearless maverick socialists. &quot;Do you like him?&quot; asked one friend, appalled and incredulous \u2013 and I do \u2013 but really it&apos;s more a question of enjoying him. It has only been a fortnight since Galloway, 57, took his seat in the Commons, and already what theatre. He was sworn in to a deathly quiet chamber, but set the BBC&apos;s Question Time ablaze later that week, reviving the all-but-forgotten tradition of public debate as blood sport. Other dramas have been less predictable, if rather more farcical. Two days after winning Bradford West by a landslide, he wed his researcher, 30 years his junior, who\u00a0he has known for six months, in an Islamic ceremony in Amsterdam. Three days later, the mother of his two sons \u2013 one of whom is just five months old \u2013 popped up, claiming that in the eyes of Islam he&apos;s still married to her. Then, last week, Jemima Khan declared in the New Statesman that Galloway converted to Islam in a London hotel 10 years ago, in\u00a0a ceremony attended by someone she knew. The MP is always described as a Catholic, but under Islamic law, Khan pointed out, a Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim \u2013 and Galloway&apos;s new bride is his third Muslim wife. By teatime, threats of libel writs were flying, raising the surreal prospect of a scion of the Goldsmith dynasty disputing the finer points of Islamic theology with a socialist firebrand from Dundee. And so the bizarre caravan of sensation and suspicion that follows Galloway wherever he goes is back on the road. When we met 10 days ago he had a\u00a0more mundane matter on his mind, and it was easy to guess what, because I found him camped with his staff around a cafe table in the public foyer of Portcullis House, next to a sign saying: &quot;George Galloway MP Office.&quot; With no office yet assigned, or security passes issued to his staff, the team and their picnic of laptops and coffee cut a comically renegade picture, which seems to both suit and insult the MP in equal measure: &quot;Laughable, isn&apos;t it?&quot; He suspects there&apos;s more to it than mere administrative oversight, and observes with offhand pride that &quot;most\u00a0people here probably half-fear, half-hate me&quot;. He couldn&apos;t care less though, he adds, because he has never been happier. &quot;Coming back in here was the best day of my life. The US Senate hearing [to which he gave evidence in 2005] was my greatest day, until 29 March. Winning that election on 29 March, in the way that we did, with the landslide that we did, was definitely the best day of my life.&quot; What is his ambition now? &quot;I don&apos;t have any political ambitions at\u00a0all.&quot; Galloway may no longer fancy himself for foreign secretary, but soon he&apos;s talking excitedly about getting a Respect mayor elected this year. The fact that his party has so far failed to produce a single other household name \u2013 even Respect&apos;s leader, Salma Yaqoob, is hardly that \u2013 doesn&apos;t discourage him\u00a0at all, though he concedes it\u00a0is\u00a0disappointing. &quot;Although \u2013 to be honest with you \u2013 the party became extremely small.&quot; Really? At times it has claimed a membership of 10,000. &quot;We were never that big, actually,&quot; he admits. &quot;At our height, we probably had 3-4,000 members. When we lost the three parliamentary seats in 2010 that we&apos;d hoped to win, we became almost minuscule.&quot; How minuscule? &quot;About 8-900 people.&quot; In fact, he goes on, &quot;it was probably winding down,&quot; and had he not won in Bradford would probably be dead. Yet now: &quot;Put your house on it\u00a0\u2013 we will win the mayoralty of Bradford in November.&quot; That&apos;s funny, I laugh, because last time we met, in 2006, he told me to put my house on Respect winning Tower Hamlets council. Galloway&apos;s predictions are the stuff of legend, delivered with grand declamatory flourishes, like declarations of war. &quot;I&apos;m the one that stood up and confronted Mrs Thatcher [in 1992],&quot; he reminds me at one point, &quot;and said, on the eve of the fall of Kabul [to the Islamist mujahideen]: &apos;I tell you now, you have opened the gates to the barbarians, and a long, dark night will now descend upon the people of Afghanistan.&apos; That&apos;s what I said two days before the fall of Kabul.&quot; That&apos;s quite a feat of recall \u2013 and he was right then, but I have always wanted to know how such impregnable confidence can keep going when predictions are proved wrong, as his was in Tower Hamlets. The answer, it turns out, is quite easy \u2013 those ones are clean forgotten. &quot;Did I? Did I predict that?&quot; he blinks in surprise. &quot;Oh well, I\u00a0was wrong that time.&quot; But in a beat he is pointing out all the\u00a0times he has been right \u2013 about Iraq, about Afghanistan, about winning Bradford West. He has also been astonishingly astute when it comes to defamation suits \u2013 to the tune of about \u00a33m, &quot;though most of it went to the lawyers.&quot; Galloway&apos;s houses in Portugal and south London were largely paid for\u00a0by newspapers unwise enough to provoke him, and he has never lost a libel case. I&apos;m quite surprised he hasn&apos;t sued over all the press reports that he arrived at his Bradford victory party in a Hummer, for &quot;as God&apos;s my judge,&quot; he swears, &quot;I&apos;ve never been in a Hummer, nor will I ever be in a Hummer.&quot; But I&apos;m curious to hear what he thinks he has got wrong in his political career. &quot;Well, I have been too brutal in dealing in political argument, and that has, unnecessarily, made enemies.&quot; I\u00a0have to say, it didn&apos;t look like a lesson he had taken too close to heart when he let rip on Question Time. &quot;But my main political mistake, in retrospect, was that state ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, in which I believed, and for which I campaigned, was a false God.&quot; Is that painful to admit? &quot;Yes. I&apos;m not saying, at all, that everything in the private garden is rosy. There&apos;s just more flowers than there were in the state garden. I&apos;m sorry to say that, and yes, it is painful.&quot; Galloway&apos;s politics today would still\u00a0be regarded as lunacy by the right, but may be closer to those of more on the left than Labour perhaps realises. Were he to wake up in No 10 tomorrow, &quot;We would bring all our soldiers home from foreign wars \u2013 thus saving billions\u00a0of pounds. We would scrap the\u00a0renewal of Trident submarines. And we would pursue what Vince Cable said was the \u00a3100bn-a-year-plus\u00a0tax avoidance and tax evasion industry. Thus, we&apos;d have no deficit. If\u00a0you do the maths, if we did those three things we not only would have no deficit, we&apos;d be quids in. We&apos;d be \u00a380bn up.&quot; I wonder what the markets would make of this solution. &quot;But you once believed in it, Decca.&quot; The reproof is softly teasing, but disarming, calculated to invoke guilt \u2013 and for a moment it works, until I remember he knows next to nothing about me or my politics, and laugh. But in that moment I glimpse the force of his famous charisma. It takes a lot to get traditional Muslim women in niqabs out canvassing for a Scot who dressed up in a leotard and pretended to be a cat on Celebrity Big Brother. It&apos;s even harder to think of anyone else in Westminster who could carry it off.     Galloway being arrested at a protest against nuclear weapons at the submarine base at Faslane, 2001. Photograph: Ross Mcdairmant/Rex Features    He claims to be less confident than we might think, though. &quot;I feel self-conscious among educated, upper-class people. Insecure and uncomfortable.&quot; Is that why he deploys a vocabulary that would shame all but the extended edition of Roget&apos;s Thesaurus? &quot;I think that&apos;s right, yeah. I think that&apos;s right. I feel an under-educated, working-class person. And, therefore, in the presence of some well-educated, upper-class people, I can feel uncomfortable and insecure.&quot; How else does that feeling manifest itself? After a long, thoughtful pause, he says quietly: &quot;Wishing I weren&apos;t there; wishing I could turn round and go away; wishing the ground would swallow me up.&quot; I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s why he boasts so much. He&apos;s a lot less self-aggrandising than the last time we met \u2013 but back then he had just emerged from the Big Brother house, so was probably feeling less secure than he does now. In fact, he says a lot of things that don&apos;t accord with his reputation. For example, he is\u00a0frequently portrayed as a rogue for whom the ends always justify the means \u2013 but despite winning 75% of\u00a0the\u00a0postal vote in Bradford West, he\u00a0is\u00a0campaigning for postal voting to\u00a0be banned. &quot;We are totally against postal voting on demand. Postal votes used to be something you got when you literally could not get to the polls; now they&apos;re available on demand and, once granted, are yours for ever. So large numbers of postal votes are delivered to places where the person no longer is. Large numbers of them are collected, unfilled-in, by these biradari chiefs,&quot; an Urdu word meaning clan seniors. &quot;It&apos;s a kind of ritual that they bring votes to the candidate to show them: &quot;Look, I&apos;m bringing in 20 votes; that&apos;s 20 votes for you \u2013 I&apos;m bringing that in.&apos;&quot; How can he be so sure? &quot;Well, I know it because they offered to do it to me. Yeah, and I said: &apos;I don&apos;t want to see anybody&apos;s vote, and I don&apos;t want you to see anybody&apos;s vote.&apos; Now, I don&apos;t know that they filled them in, rather than the voter, but it&apos;s a fair inference; it&apos;s a fair inference if someone has got 20 votes in their pocket to take to the town hall, that they were either visibly observing the person filling the vote in \u2013 which is wrong, and I think illegal \u2013 or filled them in themselves. This happens in Asian areas on a widespread basis, and it is the antithesis of democracy.&quot; Does he think some of his own votes came that way? &quot;It&apos;s possible, because people offered to show me other people&apos;s votes. So I redouble my\u00a0call for postal voting on demand to\u00a0be scrapped.&quot; Galloway&apos;s views on Arab dictators may also come as a surprise to those who conflate condemnation of &quot;Blair&apos;s liberal intervention foreign policy&quot; with support for despotism. The confusion is hardly surprising, given that Galloway has, for example, both denounced President Assad of Syria as a &quot;puppet dictator&quot; and praised him as &quot;the last Arab leader&quot;. &quot;I&apos;m against all these Arab dictators,&quot; he says emphatically. &quot;But you can&apos;t say: &apos;I&apos;m against it because it&apos;s a dictatorship, therefore I don&apos;t care if Britain and America invades it.&apos; If they do, nothing will get better, and everything will get worse.&quot; For Galloway, nothing can be worse than western military intervention, and he doesn&apos;t even want to say where he hopes the Arab spring will lead. &quot;They&apos;re not requiring yours or my approbation.&quot; The weather doesn&apos;t require my approbation, I agree \u2013 but that doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t hope for a sunny weekend. &quot;I hope that Arabs don&apos;t choose the path of fundamentalism. However, I think they will. I suspect they are going to \u2013 and we just have to make the best of it. In the end, it&apos;s nothing to do with me.&quot; Galloway has an answer for everything, and yet there is something unknowable about him \u2013 which is partly why he annoys so many people. He himself was floored by a mystery recently, though, when he came home one day and found all the ties in his bedroom had been moved. &quot;I have a sword, given to me in Saudi Arabia or somewhere, so I unsheathed my sword, and went upstairs [to the top floor]. There was no one there, but there was a bottle of gin \u2013 which, of course, would never be in my house,&quot; Galloway being a life-long teetotaller. &quot;And a gay video, which definitely would never be in my house. So the police came, and they said this person appears to have been living here in your house for some time.&quot;     Galloway at 24, an up-and-coming Labour activist in Dundee in 1978. Photograph: DC Thomson & Co Ltd    The secret lodger had broken in through an upstairs window; Galloway has no idea who it was, but is urging me to &quot;emphasise that no one can do it now because I&apos;ve got CCTV and alarms and so on&quot; when the division bell goes off. &quot;I must vote! I must vote, for fear of the media!&quot; In his previous post as MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, his abysmal voting record was cited by critics as proof that he doesn&apos;t do his job. But he points out indignantly: &quot;Voting is not the same as attendance.&quot; Representing neither the government nor opposition, &quot;I have no means of voting an abstention. You just don&apos;t vote, and then you look like you weren&apos;t here. But as I always said, the CCTV cameras prove I&apos;m here every day.&quot; And off he strides to vote, proud and alone. We had talked a great deal about the role of religion in politics, and could not have disagreed more. I thought it outrageous to urge voters in Bradford, as he did, to vote for him or fear the wrath of judgment day. Galloway can&apos;t see the problem at all: &quot;I believe that, on judgment day, people have to answer for what they did.&quot; When I ask if he is troubled that many voters thought he had converted to Islam, he\u00a0replies: &quot;Well, I don&apos;t think many of\u00a0them are interested in my religion&quot; \u2013 which is pretty rich, considering he put\u00a0out a leaflet all about which candidate was more of a Muslim. Contrary to every report I&apos;ve read, he\u00a0doesn&apos;t deny writing the leaflet himself. I think he is ludicrously slippery about invoking religion, playing it both ways to suit his own purposes, but, as he says, we are never going to agree because he doesn&apos;t think politics should be secular. &quot;So it&apos;s apples and pears, dear.&quot; He never, however, gave any indication that he was anything other than the Catholic he was born and raised. After the New Statesman article appears, we speak again. &quot;I didn&apos;t tell you that I&apos;m a Catholic,&quot; he reminds me \u2013 and, parsing the transcript, I realise he never explicitly did, though he certainly allowed that impression to go unqueried. Does he believe in\u00a0Allah? &quot;I\u00a0believe in God.&quot; Is he a Catholic or a\u00a0Muslim? &quot;I&apos;m not discussing my personal religious beliefs.&quot; But we had talked for ever about the importance of\u00a0his religious beliefs to his politics. Why won&apos;t he say what they are? &quot;It&apos;s\u00a0not necessary.&quot; The magazine claims he did not deny that the conversion ceremony took place. Galloway says his denial is on tape \u2013 and so now he is going to sue the New Statesman. &quot;Not because converting to Islam is defamatory. But calling me a liar is.&quot; And so the great Galloway soap opera is back once again, a Technicolor melodrama as complicated and compelling and crazy as ever. &quot;To be honest, I never felt that I\u00a0would never be back. And I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;ve been away.&quot;", "sentences": ["Two days after winning Bradford West by a landslide, he wed his researcher, 30 years his junior, who\u00a0he has known for six months, in an Islamic ceremony in Amsterdam."], "title": "George Galloway: 'I believe that on judgment day, people have to answer for what they did'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/29/george-galloway-interview-bradford-west", "tags": ["George Galloway", "Politics", "Respect party", "Bradford West byelection 2012", "Byelections", "Bradford", "Islam", "Religion"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-04-29T21:00:02Z", "article": "A bit like Jesus on the Via Dolorosa, Barcelona&apos;s great manager Pep Guardiola has faltered under his heavy burden. &quot;I&apos;m drained,&quot; he said at his emotional valedictory press conference on Friday as star players like Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta looked on helplessly with tears in their eyes. Guardiola has been good news throughout his career. A passionate, intelligent Catalan, he learned the game from its Dutch source and took tiki-taka \u2013 or &quot;total football&quot; \u2013 to new levels of perfection. The numinous football Bar\u00e7a played in his time was inspirational, and his sudden loss to football \u2013 after successive defeats to Chelsea in the Champions League and bitter rivals Real Madrid in the Spanish league \u2013 is a cause for grief. But the evidence of history suggests that the values Guardiola preached will continue to spread. This is because the parallels between his vision of football and early Christianity are uncanny. Back in the mists of time a new religion began with a man we know by the initials JC. He worked with a small group of trusted friends, performed miracles, and spoke to the masses. Then came betrayal and he was taken away. Then he came back, though not for long. Later his disciples went out in the world and spread the faith. Johan Cruyff&apos;s miracles in Amsterdam were many. He and his coach Rinus Michels (a sort of John the Baptist figure) raised Ajax from obscurity. More important, they invented a new way of playing. Cruyff became the greatest exponent and teacher of totaalvoetbal. His vision of perfect movement and harmony on the field was rooted in the same sublime ordering of space that one sees in the pictures of Vermeer or church painter Pieter Jansz Saenredam. It was the music of the spheres on grass. In 1973 Cruyff joined Barcelona as a player and, within months, raised them from the relegation zone (football&apos;s equivalent of death) to Spanish champions. The grateful Catalan nation dubbed him El Salvador, The Saviour. In the 1980s Cruyff returned as coach, gave Bar\u00e7a its &quot;dream team&quot;, instilled his ideas into every level of the club, and made his disciple Guardiola captain. Bar\u00e7a views itself as &quot;more than a club&quot;. Pope John Paul II was a member and, as an institution, it knows how to keep the faith. As Guardiola put it: &quot;Cruyff painted the chapel, and Barcelona coaches since merely restore and improve it.&quot; The Dutch writer Arthur van den Boogaard sees Cruyff&apos;s vision as the &quot;metaphysical solution&quot; to football. But his path is also the most difficult to follow. That&apos;s why modern high priests of the creed such as Arrigo Sacchi and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger have been as numerically few as Desert Fathers \u2013 and just as convinced of their moral superiority. The faith even has its antichrist \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Real Madrid&apos;s manager, who learned the secrets of totaalvoetbal as assistant to Louis van Gaal at Bar\u00e7a before turning to the Dark Side (defensive football). As early Christianity split into bitterly competing factions with Gnostics, Arians, Manicheans and the like, so with rival total football sects. When Foppe de Haan won the youth European championship for Holland a few years ago playing a 4-5-1 formation, Cruyff was incensed by the heresy and demanded that Dutch teams must always play 4-3-3 with wingers on the touchline. Things got bloody in the ancient world when mobs of killer monks met in places like Antioch, but Mourinho may be thinking along similar lines. At the end of a game last year he clashed with Guardiola&apos;s friend and successor Tito Vilanova, and attempted to gouge his eye. Could this be the start of a new, more dangerous, conflict between good and evil? \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "sentences": ["Johan Cruyff&apos;s miracles in Amsterdam were many."], "title": "Barcelona and the gospel of Guardiola | David Winner", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/29/barcelona-gospel-of-guardiola", "tags": ["Pep Guardiola", "Barcelona", "Religion", "Football", "Sport", "Spain"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-01T12:14:11Z", "article": "Hello and welcome to this week&apos;s blog.

Backstage at Reading University on the first night of the band&apos;s UK tour, My Bloody Valentine mainman Kevin Shields cowers in bashful bemusement under a barrage of hysterical praise from 20-year-old superfan Jason Kelpie. &quot;If the world ended tomorrow and there was nothing left but My Bloody Valentine, I&apos;d be happy. They are the coolest fucking sonic visual experience we&apos;ve got. You can&apos;t beat My Bloody Valentine with a big stick! Only having your brains blown out with a massive shotgun while on acid comes close to My Bloody Valentine! Worship at the altar of My Bloody Valentine! Religion sucks, but the closest thing to religion we&apos;ve got is My Bloody Valentine \u2026&quot; Strange that four outwardly calm individuals should consistently attract such extreme reactions. A band whose languorous work-rate makes three-toed sloths seem hyperactive, who never commit themselves to even the vaguest statement of intent, who dress like woolly mammoths and spurn the glittering limelight of cult success. A band whose lyrics rarely refer to anything remotely recognisable and whose alien music screams down from a candy-floss Valhalla, rubbing its sleepy eyes as it plummets earthwards. Yes indeed, there&apos;s plenty more where that came from \u2013 MBV have inspired more fanciful flights of purple journalistic prose than any other group of the past decade, for one simple reason: the sheer face of swirling noise that is the Valentines in full flight presents a blank canvas eight miles high for whatever open-ended interpretation the beholder wants to project there. Drugs is an obvious favourite. Sex and dreams and extreme violence are up there, too. Very few critics mention aquariums or kitchen utensils, but they might just as well do. Such vanities are not on Kevin&apos;s mind after the Reading show. Characteristically modest in his critical post-mortem, he complains: &quot;It was really mediocre, the sound was awful onstage, we played badly.&quot; Not strictly true. There are slack moments of routine grunge-rock in tonight&apos;s set, but everything else is a fiercely controlled fireworks display of overheating psychedelic noise. Strafed by strobes and bathed in eerie purple light, the Valentines surgically extract immaculate sound-symphonies from their awesome new album Loveless, and methodically mutilate them almost beyond recognition. Bone-crunching dance beats and ethnic twiddles from their two recent EPs, Glider and Tremolo, also make a strong showing. But it is the fragments of 1988&apos;s seminal Isn&apos;t Anything LP that really rock Reading, particularly a mutant cousin of Feed Me With Your Kiss which emerges from an ear-splitting 10-minute encore of apocalyptic thunder. World War III contained on a single stage \u2013 call MBV an art band if you want, but this brain-bending display is the closest thing to the catharsis called rock&apos;n&apos;roll anyone here has ever witnessed. It amounts to a triumphant piece of self-justifying theatre from a band many thought could never match the slamming brilliance of Isn&apos;t Anything, a band shrouded for three years in rumours concerning scrapped recordings and suicidally spiralling studio costs. Fixing a price tag upwards of \u00a3250,000 on the long-overdue Loveless, the music press predicted bankruptcy for MBV&apos;s label, Creation, and hot water for Kevin if he didn&apos;t deliver something with platinum potential. Judging by the album&apos;s critical reception, the future of both band and label seems assured. When the buzzing hordes of acolytes from post-Valentines bands Ride, Lush, Chapterhouse and Slowdive dissipate from the dressing room in Reading, Kevin is finally willing to nail those rumours. &quot;Creation are no closer than any other label to going bankrupt,&quot; he offers ambivalently, confirming the astronomical figure quoted above but stressing this also covered two expensive EPs, three videos and the band&apos;s living costs over three years. &quot;They paid for everything bit by bit so they&apos;d eaten up the cost as they went along. They felt strained, but nothing special: they would spend easily as much on two or three smaller bands.&quot; Creation themselves are understandably cagey about discussing their financial dealings with MBV, or how the strain has affected their relationship with the group. However, one source contradicts Kevin by hinting that the quarter-million figure belongs to Loveless only. Enigmatic label boss Alan McGee will only reveal &quot;It cost a lot of money, but we all love the album&quot;. In their pre-Creation days, MBV discovered a sonic frequency which causes physical pain and purposely used it to make their live sets very uncomfortable for audiences: &quot;We did it for a few years when we thought we were massively misunderstood, when we were just perceived as a twee pop band.&quot; So with tonight&apos;s sturm und drang finale, is Kevin still trying to hurt people with sound? &quot;No, it&apos;s just pure noise for the hell of it. The fun is in watching people&apos;s faces. That&apos;s why we light the audience up, to see their discomfort.&quot; Belying his hulking frame, Kevin whispers with a sing-song Irish burr, the legacy of a childhood spent mostly in Dublin, where he and Valentines&apos; drummer Colm O&apos;Coisoig had their first forays into the sonic twilight zone dismissed by an insular pop community. &quot;I did all my progressive stuff years before I came to this country. I loved bands like the Ramones and didn&apos;t know much about the history of music, so as far as I was concerned The Ramones appeared from nowhere. I didn&apos;t know about all these 60s garage punk bands. I was hung up for a few years on the idea that you had to be original; me and Colm spent two years making original music but it was boring and uninspired. We weren&apos;t doing it for the right reasons.&quot; Decamping to Europe on the advice of former Virgin Prune Gavin Friday, the nascent Valentines \u2013 now incorporating guitarist Bilinda Butcher, bassist Debbie Googe and a short-lived singer called Dave \u2013 enjoyed eight months of debauchery in Berlin and Amsterdam before arriving in London just in time to collide with the C86 indie movement. An unwanted reputation for jangly feyness was foisted upon them, largely due to their weedy first efforts on Lazy, the label run by Primitives manager Wayne Morris. A stormy marriage, as Kevin recalls. &quot;That was a disaster \u2013 it taught us about not trusting people. Wayne Morris was just so evil to us, him and the Primitives, we fell out with him before we even finished the record. He was so ruthless, he had no respect for the idea of people making music. The Primitives were more manufactured than any Stock Aitken Waterman band. I&apos;ve seen Wayne tell the guitarist to completely change his hairstyle, he told Tracey he would have her making love to the microphone in a miniskirt within six months \u2026 and he did!&quot; Leaving Lazy \u2013 and Dave \u2013 behind, MBV reinvented themselves for Creation as merchants of dreamy pop tunes clothed in juddering noise volcanoes. With Kevin as main songwriter, the channelled feedback eruptions and bent-out-of-shape guitars on Isn&apos;t Anything hung in the air like jet-propelled abstract art, a rootless and seemingly unassailable precipice of pure pop. Suddenly, name-checking the Valentines became hip and indie hopefuls began roughing up their sound all over Southern England. Remembering the fickleness of public opinion, Kevin questions the true extent of his band&apos;s influence. &quot;The only thing we&apos;ve definitely done on our own is having something aggressive and caustic but at the same time really liquid and fluid. It&apos;s always impossible to see yourself in other people. Most of the bands that are seen to be influenced by us, their strange sounds come from using lots of effects. There&apos;s no effect in existence you could plug into and have our sound, it&apos;s just the way we treat things, mainly the tremolo arm on our guitars \u2026 the way I think about sound is like a picture in my head, a textured picture. I&apos;m thinking of writing them down some day.&quot; That should make interesting reading for Oxford&apos;s Ride, who caught most of the flak for being prime MBV copyists, partly due to sharing the same label. Singer Mark Gardiner acknowledges the inspiration but denies jumping on the bandwagon: &quot;If we&apos;d wanted to be part of any scene when we started we&apos;d have put on baggy trousers and pretended to come from up north. We&apos;re on Creation for the same reason a lot of bands are, because it&apos;s a label that lets you do what you want, they give you freedom. To me all these bands don&apos;t sound alike at all.&quot; One significant difference between the Valentines and their descendants is their distance from the social scene that loosely binds these younger bands. Despite a professed love of Ecstasy, House and especially hip-hop \u2013 &quot;it beats the shit out of most rock music when it comes to being experimental, it&apos;s been a constant source of inspiration to us&quot; \u2013 Kevin generally avoids clubs and pop-star ligging. His long-term involvement with Bilinda and her eight-year-old son Toby keeps him away from frantic socialising, but does this relationship fuel MBV&apos;s music? Sleepy-eyed Bilinda is doubtful. &quot;It&apos;s funny because people have said there is a feminine sound to the music, but the music comes from Kevin. Obviously if I&apos;m singing it&apos;s going to have a feminine touch to it, but quite often people mistake mine and Kevin&apos;s voices anyway \u2026 it&apos;s probably more androgynous than actually feminine.&quot; Perhaps non-committal is a better description. Despite their shuddering magnificence, the Valentines&apos; songs remain inaccessibly private and largely emotionless, loveless, even: the aforementioned blank screen on to which observers project their religious, sexual and narcotic fantasies. Kevin confesses this is a deliberate strategy. &quot;Our lives have been too real to talk about. Not glamorous stuff like getting arrested for drugs or whatever, it&apos;s more mundane domestic shit that really fucks you up, personal things that are totally beyond the experience of the average student. Bilinda happened to bring up a kid under bad circumstances, it&apos;s very real, we don&apos;t really talk about it. That&apos;s why we often think we might break up because the band seems too trivial sometimes \u2026&quot; After dropping a few more hints \u2013 family trauma, depression, immigration hassles \u2013 Kevin steers our conversation into calmer waters. The band&apos;s recent live debuts in Japan and Australia energised him, but touring Britain remains a daunting prospect. &quot;When we tour we tend to get wrecked a lot from sheer boredom: you&apos;re allowed to be a complete idiot and it&apos;s not seen as something stupid,&quot; he chuckles.", "sentences": ["We weren&apos;t doing it for the right reasons.&quot; Decamping to Europe on the advice of former Virgin Prune Gavin Friday, the nascent Valentines \u2013 now incorporating guitarist Bilinda Butcher, bassist Debbie Googe and a short-lived singer called Dave \u2013 enjoyed eight months of debauchery in Berlin and Amsterdam before arriving in London just in time to collide with the C86 indie movement."], "title": "My Bloody Valentine: 'It's just pure noise for the hell of it' \u2013 a classic interview from the vaults", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/may/01/my-bloody-valentine-interview", "tags": ["Music", "Indie", "Pop and rock", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-03T21:29:08Z", "article": "Bmibaby, which employs 470 staff, is to close this September after no buyer was found for the loss-making airline.

Even Friday&apos;s Guardian reports concern. It&apos;s easy to tease the Mail, which carries a great deal of titillating smut both online and in regular heavy-breathing features on the centre sections of the printed edition, where not even the editor can pretend it isn&apos;t there. But I have some sympathy with its alarm at the ease with which children can access hardcore stuff on their computers and its demands that the government step in and protect the kids. I know, I know. The Mail moans a lot about the nanny state ruining our lives, yet also complains angrily on adjoining pages that Whitehall is failing to protect its readers from all sorts of threats. Porn, bankers, drunken teenagers, Islamists, child molesters \u2026 the list is a long one. But most of us share similar inconsistencies, and life would be less fun without them. For once (do I mean &quot;for once&quot; or &quot;as usual&quot;?), David Cameron has moved to appease the Beast of Fleet Street and staged a breakfast conference on Thursday, one which led to a promise that ministers will consult on requiring internet service providers (ISPs) \u2013 they won&apos;t want to do this \u2013 to create &quot;opt-in&quot; devices on their software. More a case of big state than &quot;big society&quot;. No 10 will have been encouraged by a high court judge&apos;s ruling this week that UK-based ISPs should block access to the file-sharing website Pirate Bay. But there will be all sorts of complications and even the ambitious Tory MP Claire Perry, who has been driving the campaign in the Commons, acknowledges that it might be impractical. &quot;We need to know the facts,&quot; she says. Quite so. A phone-in caller on BBC local radio on Friday morning was protesting that her firm&apos;s policy was to block access to dirty sites at work and have the system report to management anyone who tried to find them. She&apos;d got into trouble for trying to find a Guardian article on breastfeeding. Yeah, right? But, quite independently of technical options, we also bring strong opinions, values even, to the issue on both sides of the argument. The Guardian, which can be very prudish on all sorts of issues, tends towards the libertarian line on porn \u2013 here&apos;s a good example from the Organ Grinder&apos;s blog \u2013 even though many feminists dislike it intensely. In Friday&apos;s Times, columnist Phil Collins, who used to be a Blair speechwriter, I seem to recall, writes an untypically glib piece in favour of telling nanny to get lost: smoking, drinking, porn, we&apos;re all adults and the censorious legacy of Methodism in the Labour movement is one that does it no favours, he says. It&apos;s a superficially attractive position, one Collins shares with all sorts of clever rightwingers who believe in a minimal state, low rates of flat taxes and the inherent wisdom of markets to sort out bankers&apos; pay, not stances I imagine he endorses. Never mind, but it&apos;s not just the Mail that gets its thong in a twist. Perhaps it&apos;s no surprise. Tony Blair got into a dreadful muddle on such themes. He cracked down hard on smoking in buildings, yet legalised 24/7 boozing and saw casinos as a means of urban regeneration in poor city districts and stricken seaside towns such as Blackpool. He tried to ban hunting with dogs and softened the penalties on cannabis possession. The list is also a long one and I haven&apos;t mentioned 90-day detention for terrorist suspects yet. One obvious omission from the Collins world view was, of course, children, the focus of the Mail&apos;s campaign, which it cranks up again whenever there&apos;s a slow news day or real news it prefers to downplay. Surely the case is unanswerable that we should do our best to make it difficult for eight-year-old computer whizzes to stumble upon disturbing and unsuitable material online by accident? Myself, I think insufficient stress is placed on the need to protect them from violent imagery, mostly in cartoon form, and relentlessly so in video games. Whether it&apos;s sex or violence, physical or mental, being bombarded with the stuff is bound to coarsen young sensibilities. Most normal kids from secure homes will be able to sort this stuff out, but not all kids are so lucky. Just look at that deluded internet fantasist Anders Breivik, now on trial in Oslo for mass murder. The same goes for booze, fags and the illegal end of the narcotics market, not to mention premature sexualisation by people who want to make money out of anxiety, something Cameron has spoken about before. It&apos;s unpleasant and unhealthy, society has a duty to protect its children and to do so with confidence and authority. Where do we draw the line? At what age? Good question. As in the US, British society seems simultaneously to want to treat its children as adults in important respects \u2013 &quot;Votes at 16 anyone? Why of course&quot; \u2013 while also infantilising them in others. It&apos;s been illegal to buy cigarettes here before 18 since 2007. In the US it&apos;s illegal again to buy alcohol \u2013 even to drink it at home in some states, I think \u2013 before 21. No wonder the kids buy so much cocaine. The latest burst of puritanism is moving towards plain cigarette packaging (&quot;the state is confiscating our brands,&quot; say the tobacco barons) and a minimum price for a unit of booze, though England and Scotland can&apos;t agree what it should be. Poor people will suffer most and smuggling \u2013 already very serious \u2013 will increase, say the doomsters and the libertarians. Well maybe, and the argument for liberty is always intellectually attractive. But the practical consequences can be very unpleasant, as our own city centres frequently demonstrate at weekends, and authorities in Amsterdam are again troubled with at their hash-selling cafes. As usual the poor and ill-equipped are most at risk, suffer most and can least afford rehab at the Priory. So we should be unembarrassed in favouring state intervention to protect adults from themselves \u2013 and the taxpayer from the horrendous NHS and social service bill that often follows in the wake of destructive behaviour \u2013 as we are to protect children, albeit less of it. &quot;As much as necessary, as little as possible,&quot; is my motto on this, as with much else. Pragmatic trial and error will show what works best. Consistency will help, so will confidence that it is right to set boundaries. Andrew Lansley, no less, tried to set one the other day when he said that alcohol (and even crisps) are fine in suitable quantities, but that tobacco never is. You may disagree, so let&apos;s talk about it. As for porn, it may have its adult uses but is fundamentally degrading. No, you disagree?

Denied a farewell for Cardiff Blues at the Scarlets on Saturday because of a shoulder injury, he will find out later this month whether he will make a final appearance for his country, having been stranded on 99 caps since last August. The 36-year-old, who was part of two grand slam campaigns and went on three Lions tours, has not been in the Wales squad this season but he is in line to feature in the capped match against the Barbarians next month because an advance party will be in Australia to prepare for the three-Test series against the Wallabies and his successor in the national side, Sam Warburton, is struggling to overcome a shoulder injury. An internet campaign is being waged on Williams&apos;s behalf but it is not a subject a normally accessible player is comfortable talking about. &quot;I am flattered by the public&apos;s opinion that I should play against the Barbarians and win my 100th cap and the reaction has surprised me but I cannot talk about it one way or the other,&quot; he said. When it was pointed out that his selection would complete a circle as he had made his international debut against the Barbarians in 1996, he finished the remark for his questioner: &quot;And it would be lovely to win your 100th cap against them.&quot; Whether he becomes Wales&apos;s third centurion after Gareth Thomas and Stephen Jones, the fly-half who is making his final appearance for the Scarlets this evening before joining Wasps, will not alter the significant contribution Williams has made to the game in Wales and beyond. There were times in the dark years when he appeared to be taking on opponents single-handed, a consistent performer in a side whose form was as variable as the weather. As with Neil Back, there were those who questioned whether Williams was big enough to be an international open-side but what he lacked in size and height he made up for with his pace, athleticism, technique and reading of the game. There have been few players, in any era, as effective as him at the breakdown. Gary Gold, the Newcastle director of rugby and former South Africa assistant coach, last month paid Williams a tribute when he said that the Springboks were always surprised and delighted when Wales, and the Lions in 2009, did not select him against them. &quot;I do not know what to say to that,&quot; said Williams, when told of the compliment. &quot;I remember when I was in the academy system that, if you could not bench press a certain amount, they said you would never play for Wales. It was not my strongest area in the gym and I had to develop my game to ensure I got the best out of myself. I wish I had been a couple of inches taller and a couple of stone heavier but, as Scott Johnson [the former Wales and Ospreys coach who is joining the Scotland management] used to tell me, you cannot put in what God left out. The role of seven has changed. Just before professionalism, big players there were vogue, such as Ben Clarke, but Richie McCaw altered the dynamic with his work at the contact area. He has developed his game which has become all-consuming. Players are bigger, stronger and quicker now.the Six Nations, a credit to the nation. I am fortunate to have crossed the divide and experience the game in different eras.&quot; Williams celebrated his 20th birthday on the start of the first professional season in 1995. &quot;You can tell how the game has changed because when I heard that rugby was abandoning amateurism, I was on tour with Pontypridd in Amsterdam where we were in a tournament with Boroughmuir and Wasps. The real change then was that you got paid but it took a while before there was a real difference in training. There is such an intensity to it now that the pace of rugby in the last four or five years has increased to such an extent that the sport today is unrecognisable from when I started.&quot; Williams made his senior debut for Pontypridd in 1994 after being capped at schoolboy and Under-21 level, and spent six seasons with the club before joining Cardiff. He remained at the Arms Park when regional rugby was introduced in 2003 and was persuaded to change his mind about retiring from international rugby after the 2007 World Cup, celebrating his second grand slam a few months later. &quot;I am thankful to have had a long career,&quot; said Williams, who was made an MBE in the last honours list. &quot;I have been lucky with injuries given that open-side is such a demanding position.&quot; During his career he lost his brother and mother to cancer. &quot;Personal tragedy puts rugby in a different perspective. It made me realise how fortunate I was to be doing what I was and it made me want to prolong my career. Welsh rugby is in a better place than when I started when you look at the core players in the senior side and those coming through. When I look at the likes of Sam Warburton and Justin Tipuric contesting the seven jersey, I am glad I started when I did: I am not sure I would win a cap now.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;You can tell how the game has changed because when I heard that rugby was abandoning amateurism, I was on tour with Pontypridd in Amsterdam where we were in a tournament with Boroughmuir and Wasps."], "title": "Internet campaign presses Wales to give Martyn Williams one more cap", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/may/04/martyn-williams-wales", "tags": ["Cardiff Blues", "RaboDirect Pro12 2011-12", "Pro12", "Rugby union", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-04T21:55:04Z", "article": "&quot;Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man,&quot; laments Jacob in Genesis, before, disguised by goatskin, usurping his blind father&apos;s blessing. This biblical story of cheating is a guiding motif within David Park&apos;s sympathetic account of ordinary souls who find they&apos;ve somehow sold their birthright for a mess of pottage. Locked into disappointments at once solipsistic and shambolic, they wonder whether light may be found on a weekend away in Amsterdam. Park&apos;s eighth novel seems to abandon the political landscape of the Irish Troubles so powerfully addressed in earlier works, especially The Truth Commissioner. But the themes recur in a minor key. Park descends to that Yeatsian place where &quot;all the ladders start / In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart&quot;. Under Belfast skies, wry, rueful Alan is losing hair, wife, home, job and George Best&apos;s autograph. Opening at the fallen football star&apos;s funeral, the novel concludes at a disappointing Bob Dylan concert in Amsterdam. It&apos;s a book of aftermaths and comedowns, has-beens and nobodies. Alan&apos;s rival, a hirsute builder, plays the Jacob role, appropriating Alan&apos;s wife, household and nourishing soup; meanwhile Alan is in thrall to his son, a needy and self-harming teenage goth. Karen, a single mother, sustains two joyless cleaning jobs and a thankless daughter&apos;s parasitism. Wifely Marion nourishes suspicion of her ageing husband&apos;s possible sexual straying. The heart secretes, consumes and circulates its own peculiar poisons. Parks, in a slow-paced, loquacious weave of narratives, carries the reader into the intimate places of his characters&apos; minds, using a technique of third person narration focused on each in turn. Careful realism charts the quest for a transfiguring light, such as glows in portraits by Vermeer and Rembrandt in the Amsterdam of their tragicomic quest. With its three sets of people and its moment-by-moment describing of progress \u2013 home, departure lounge, airports, hotels \u2013 the narrative can seem laborious. Yet the humanity of Park&apos;s writing is such that even at the most prosaic of moments, unique insights quiver into life. Amsterdam offers each character a draught of poison accompanied by an epiphany. Karen and Alan drink deepest: their interweaving tales carry the strongest charge and the novel would have lost nothing by omitting the story of Marion&apos;s suspicions of her cardboard husband. Park excels at examining the covert thought-processes of the secret self, and the small convulsions of intimate anguish over the intractable quandaries of family life. Alan&apos;s &quot;heart kicked repeatedly as if a hard stone had been skimmed over it&quot;. Karen, though she finds in Vermeer&apos;s portraits\u00a0some lucent message that kindles a sense that &quot;she was someone&quot;, has to\u00a0swallow the toxic knowledge that her daughter has secretly invited the father who deserted them to give her away at the wedding which Karen is scrimping to provide. The rage and hurt that assail her at the recognition that &quot;they had both cheated on her&quot; are brilliantly evoked. In The Light of Amsterdam, the heart&apos;s gains are slight, equivocal and transient; they have to be savoured within the fugitive moment. The novel links hands \u2013 in a spirit of wincing, nostalgic scepticism - with Victorian fiction&apos;s pledging of hope for a possible change of light, a view from the window, inner growth through insight.

But in recent years the popularity of cycling in Britain has soared, with people of all fitness levels looking to swing their leg over the saddle and get\u00a0involved. Surprising as it may seem, Britain is now the second-largest bike-buying nation in Europe, behind Germany,\u00a0and\u00a0in some parts of the country bikes are outnumbering cars during rush hour, according to recent studies by Transport for London and bike retailer Halfords. Cast your eyes left and right when crossing a main road in almost any UK city and you will see evidence of this shift towards all things pedal-powered. Cyclists\u00a0are everywhere, and they come in all shapes and sizes.So what&apos;s been the catalyst for this fuel-free revolution? For starters it&apos;s a sport that we are actually rather good at, as witnessed by the number of medals won by British cyclists on track and tarmac. Riders such as\u00a0Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton have become household names, as have Team Sky&apos;s Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish. World road race champion Cavendish\u00a0was voted 2011 BBC Sports Personality of the Year \u2013 another sign of the sport&apos;s increased popularity.  However, one of the biggest factors behind the sport&apos;s growth is that cycling has loosened up. While you will still see plenty of neon Lycra out there, these days there is less of an obsession with notching up miles, burning calories and buying the right (ie\u00a0most expensive) bike. For the millions out there hitting the open roads, it is simply about enjoying the ride. This is something that anyone can relate\u00a0to, whether you are on a carbon-fibre racer or a secondhand bike with a basket. Yet this is about more than just a collective desire for fresh air. One of the biggest reasons why biking is now so popular \u2013\u00a0especially in towns and cities \u2013 is\u00a0that it&apos;s simply more practical (and a lot more fun) than taking the bus, train or\u00a0tube. And\u00a0as\u00a0for driving to work in cities such as London, Leeds, Birmingham and Bristol \u2013 forget it. While those trapped in their cars watch precious hours of their lives drift by in traffic queues, cyclists never have to worry about congestion.  In many places you don&apos;t even need to own a bike to give cycling a go. Cycle-hire schemes are being embraced by towns and cities around the UK, the most famous being London&apos;s Barclays Cycle Hire \u2013 introduced by the capital&apos;s bike-riding mayor, Boris Johnson.  The idea is simple: grab a bike from one of the 600 or so docking stations, ride it from A to B then drop it off at the nearest station. If you haven&apos;t signed up to the scheme, you can pay as you go using a debit or credit card. But it&apos;s not as much fun as owning a bike. Another crucial ingredient in the growth of cycling is the sheer variety of bikes available now. Walk into your local bike shop a decade ago and your choice was basically racer, BMX, mountain bike or hybrid \u2013\u00a0the latter looking a bit like a mountain bike but with skinnier tyres.  Look in any bike shop window these days, however, and you will see traditional Dutch bikes like the ones you get in Amsterdam (super comfy but very heavy), &quot;sit-up-and-begs&quot; equipped with a basket, single-speed bikes (one gear = low maintenance) and fold-up bikes that you can carry on to a train.  For those who find going uphill a bit of a chore, there&apos;s a new generation of electric bikes\u00a0on the market. When the going gets tough, the rider pushes a button and\u00a0a\u00a0battery-powered motor takes the strain. But let&apos;s be honest \u2013 it&apos;s much more satisfying when you put in a bit of work. And with hundreds of organised, mass-participation rides happening all over the country this year \u2013 including the free Sky Ride events (see below) \u2013 there&apos;s now more of an incentive to get out there and get pedalling. \u2022 This content was Produced for Guardian Brand Partnerships by Seven Plus to a brief agreed with Sky and paid for by Sky", "sentences": ["Look in any bike shop window these days, however, and you will see traditional Dutch bikes like the ones you get in Amsterdam (super comfy but very heavy), &quot;sit-up-and-begs&quot; equipped with a basket, single-speed bikes (one gear = low maintenance) and fold-up bikes that you can carry on to a train."], "title": "Get on your bike", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/05/get-on-your-bike", "tags": []}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-05T23:05:00Z", "article": "Shoulders down, elbows relaxed, forearms doing the work: the stance is perfect for a conductor.

Only the eyes, a clear grey-blue, are a little crinkled, animated by the grins and frowns which are part of his expressive nature.     Mariss Jansons playing conductor, aged 3. Photograph: courtesy Mariss Jansons/Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra    Nominating a &quot;best conductor&quot; is a futile activity, but many music connoisseurs, if pushed, would name the Latvian-born Jansons, who is chief conductor both of Amsterdam&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the Munich-based Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. Both ensembles made the top 10 in a 2008 Gramophone list of the world&apos;s top 20 orchestras, giving Jansons the limelight as the only conductor to appear twice in the list. He will be in the UK next week to conduct the hallowed Concertgebouw as part of their international residency at the Barbican. Born in Nazi-occupied Riga in 1943, Jansons was steeped in music from the cradle. His mother was Jewish, forced into hiding at the time of his birth having lost family members in the Riga ghetto. Unexpectedly, he is Lutheran, like his father. &quot;My mother knew it was dangerous for me to be Jewish. In Soviet Riga you took your father&apos;s culture and heritage\u2026 &quot; The sentence peters out. He is not comfortable with these dark recollections. Does he remember that infant snap being taken, or the music he was &quot;conducting&quot; at the time? &quot;No, I have no idea,&quot; he chuckles. &quot;But I was certainly already interested. My father was a conductor and my mother was a soprano. I spent so much of my early childhood in the opera house at Riga where they worked. They didn&apos;t like leaving me at home with a nanny. I soon knew all the ballets from memory and many operas. And it was the start of my fantasy: to play [violin] in someone&apos;s theatre orchestra, or maybe to dance and of course to conduct.&quot; He had a toy theatre which has become part of the Jansons mythology. An only child, he played with it for hours on end, staging his own performances. &quot;I&apos;d make instruments out of two sticks, singing my way through music I&apos;d heard. But I was already in effect studying conducting techniques, watching my father or his colleagues even when I was very small.&quot; An incipient talent for football,\u00a0spotted by a local trainer when he was around six, was soon quashed by his parents: young Mariss would become a musician and that was the end of the matter. The first disruption to this absorbing way of life occurred when the family moved to the USSR in 1956 when Jansons was 13. His father, Arvids Jansons, had been appointed assistant conductor to the powerful and influential Yevgeny Mravinsky at the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra. Thrown into a new culture at an awkward age, as well as having to negotiate the highly competitive Soviet education system, the teenager was sent to study violin and conducting at the Leningrad Conservatory. He found the experience traumatic. &quot;It wasn&apos;t so easy. It was, perhaps, one of the greatest difficulties of my life, even though people were warm and welcoming. I was thrust into a higher level of teaching, in a new language which I didn&apos;t understand. My father was a famous conductor. I had to make my own mark. I had to be\u00a0serious and disciplined and work very hard.&quot; Did he then, and does he now, feel in any sense an outsider? In the course of a working day he switches from Russian to German to English, none of them his native tongue. He has two passports \u2013 Russian and Latvian. His wife Irina is Russian. &quot;None of this matters to me. I am a cosmopolitan. I work mainly in Holland, Germany and Switzerland. My home is in St Petersburg. I wish countries could borrow the best from one another. I admire, for example, the discipline and respect you find in Japan.&quot; While hardly an advocate for the old Soviet regime, he still appreciates certain aspects. &quot;The educational standards were so incredibly high. It saddens me now that Russia is so much about money and following your own pleasure.&quot; Surely his religious belief, a powerful element in his psychological makeup, was discouraged? &quot;How could they stop what was inside me? I did not attend religious ceremonies but my belief was and remains strong. They&apos;d have had to kill me to get it out of me.&quot; After spending a few years as a professional violinist, Jansons worked as a conductor in Leningrad, where he took over his father&apos;s old job and spent a while &quot;getting out from under his shadow&quot;. He moved to the Oslo Philharmonic as music director in 1979, where he stayed more than two decades but fell out over the lack of a good concert hall (a battle he is now fighting, with minimal success, in Munich). The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra followed (1997-2004), but he was never in his element there and found the jet lag exhausting. Now he works only with an elite four orchestras: his own ensembles in Amsterdam and Munich, plus the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic. He refuses to guest conduct with other orchestras. He doesn&apos;t, as far as I know, advertise expensive watches. You will not find him acting as a public ambassador for world peace or education like Daniel Barenboim \u2013 though naturally he cares about these issues \u2013 or attracting the headlines with quite the same certainty as Simon Rattle or Claudio Abbado. Jansons prefers a less showy existence. His close relationship with his musicians is referred to by both sides in terms of a love affair. &quot;Orchestra have to work with many conductors,&quot; Jansons observes. &quot;They want variety. I must always be working at the highest level myself, because that is what is expected of me.&quot; This ruthless dedication is one of the reasons his artistry is so valued. Another is his physical vulnerability. He has a worrying medical history. His father died in Manchester from a heart attack on the podium while conducting the Hall\u00e9 in 1984. Jansons too, almost unbelievably, suffered the same experience in 1997 but miraculously survived: he had reached the closing pages of La boh\u00e8me in Oslo when he collapsed with heart failure. He took two years to make a full recovery. His health remains a source of anxiety, especially for his wife and doctors, but he considers himself fit. &quot;The heart attack was a very dramatic situation,&quot; he agrees, with typical understatement. Players told him later that he was still trying to conduct Puccini&apos;s score even as he slumped to the floor. &quot;And I suppose I probably was, though I do not remember.&quot; Now fitted with a defibrillator and closely monitored, he tries to live healthily, relax more, eat a good diet and take more holidays. &quot;But for every human being such an event is shocking. You cannot suddenly stop being nervous and anxious about things. You just do your best to manage.&quot; His timetable remains hectic. Little wonder he is said to travel with a medicine chest rattling with pills for any eventuality. &quot;I try not to exaggerate the problem. Sometimes I overwork. The conducting itself is OK. But when you&apos;re a chief conductor there is an enormous amount of administration and meetings and other concerns. I am rehearsing and that&apos;s already hard\u00a0work, but I must also be involved in auditions, in deciding programmes and soloists.&quot; Jansons has been with the Concertgebouw since 2002 and is only the sixth chief conductor in the history of the orchestra, which celebrates its 125th anniversary next year. One of his predecessors, Bernard Haitink, 83, will conduct a concert at the Barbican residency. Jansons&apos;s own will be devoted to Richard Strauss, whose music is closely associated with the orchestra through Willem Mengelberg,\u00a0chief conductor from 1895 to 1945. He shaped the Amsterdam sound, and was a close associate of Strauss. Does\u00a0this give the players a special &quot;Strauss&quot; sound or is that an exaggeration? &quot;It&apos;s difficult to explain, and very interesting, but there is a sort of miracle that happens when they play Strauss, or Mahler too. You can say &apos;but no one played with Mengelberg. The musicians are international, the playing habits quite different from a century ago, so how can it be?&apos; But there is some sort of spirit, some psychological moment of recognition,\u00a0and I think you can say that it is a tradition being passed on.&quot; Jan Raes, chief executive of the RCO since 2008 and a former orchestral musician, describes Jansons as &quot;a perpetual student. He&apos;s always well prepared. He uses every second of rehearsals efficiently, with no long stories. He gives them everything he has. He is never laid back. All the players feel the pressure to work hard at the highest level, but they are always respectful too.&quot; &quot;Yes, Mariss is mercilessly hard on himself, and uncompromising,&quot; agrees Peter Meisel, a spokesman from Jansons&apos;s other orchestra, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. &quot;After a concert he will get the recording [for private orchestral use] and that same night, after the post-concert event when it is already late, he will listen to it all the way through to see what was good, what was bad.&quot; And if he finds errors? &quot;He blames himself.&quot; &quot;My task is to correct,&quot; Jansons says. &quot;You must blame yourself if something goes wrong.&quot; What happens when he conducts the same works with his two orchestras? Do they ever sound the same? &quot;No completely, totally different! Each great orchestra still has an individual sound, thank God,&quot; Jansons laughs. He makes the comparison with having two children (he himself has one, a daughter from his first marriage, who works as a rehearsal pianist at the Mariinsky theatre): &quot;You love them equally and you appreciate and negotiate their idiosyncrasies.&quot; He doesn&apos;t mind comparing his orchestras out loud, either. The Bavarians are &quot;in the best sense German, with a big sound and tremendous explosive excitement.&quot; By contrast the august Concertgebouw is &quot;transparent, capable of great delicacy, polished, never forced&quot;. In addition to the Strauss concert at the Barbican, Jansons will deliver a lecture on the mysterious art of conducting. &quot;Not everyone can take the baton. The conductor doesn&apos;t produce the sound, of course. If a principal woodwind or brass player cannot play a passage, it&apos;s tragic. It&apos;s not so difficult to beat in time.&quot; The virtuosic musicians he works with will play the notes whatever the conductor does, or fails to do. &quot;So you have to study deeply and express your wishes. The notes are just signs. You have to go behind them and see what your fantasy tells you. But how do you express that through sound? If you think of the technical aspects of conducting as being on the ground floor of a big building, then 20 floors up you are beginning perhaps to get the sound you want.&quot; He checks his watch. He must go. His conducting duties at Lucerne&apos;s Easter festival are completed. Is he travelling home to St Petersburg for a rest? &quot;No, I&apos;m off to hear Bernard Haitink rehearsing with my orchestra\u00a0and I must not be late. I want to see what he does, and how they respond. He is such a wonderful Bruckner conductor, you see. I might learn something.&quot; The very notion, coming from one of the finest Bruckner conductors of our era, seems ridiculous but is, one must concede, just possible.

Although wildly optimistic Arsenal fans continue to cling to the faint hope that their resolutely non-commital star striker will remain at the Emirates next season, the recent purchase of Lukas Podolski, not to mention the draft being generated by the fluttering of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s eyelashes in the general direction of Fulham&apos;s Clint Dempsey, would suggest that the chances of the 28-year-old either inking a new deal with the Gunners are slim to say the least.

Elsewhere on Merseyside, Everton want to shore up their defence by bringing lanky lank-haired West Brom centre-half Jonas Olsson to Goodison Park.

The FBI said in a statement it is in possession of a device that is similar to others previously used by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, a militant Islamist organisation primarily active in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The Associated Press quoted unnamed US officials as saying that the would-be bomber, based in Yemen, had been given the bomb by al-Qaida, which had left the choice of plane and the timing to him. The CIA intervened to seize the bomb, AP reported. The fate of the alleged bomber is still unknown. The White House, the FBI and other sources confirmed most of AP&apos;s version of events, except its claim that the plot had been conceived to coincide roughly with last week&apos;s anniversary of the killing of the al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden. Caitlin Hayden, deputy national security council spokeswoman at the White House, said the president had been informed about the plot last month. &quot;The disruption of this IED [improvised explosive device] plot underscores the necessity of remaining vigilant against terrorism here and abroad,&quot; she said. AP revealed that it first learned about the story last week, but agreed to a request by the White House to hold back because intelligence operations were ongoing. The White House asked the news agency to wait until Tuesday, when an official announcement would be made, but the AP, having satisfied itself that there were no longer any security issues, released its story on Monday. Security forces around the world were on special alert last week, anticipating that al-Qaida might try to mount a revenge attack to mark the anniversary of Bin Laden&apos;s death at the hands of a US special forces team at his compound in Pakistan on 2 May 2011. But the day passed without incident. In spite of the alleged Yemeni bomb plot going on in the background, the US department of homeland security last week issued a statement saying that although threats from al-Qaida and its affiliates continued to evolve, officials had &quot;no indication of any specific, credible threats or plots against the US tied to the one-year anniversary of Bin Laden&apos;s death&quot;. In 2009, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian, attempted to detonate plastic explosives hidden in his underwear on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. He confessed and was sentenced in February this year to life in prison. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula claimed in 2009 to have been behind the plot. The FBI, in a statement about the latest incident, said: &quot;The FBI currently has possession of the IED and is conducting technical and forensics analysis on it. Initial exploitation indicates that the device is very similar to IEDs that have been used previously by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula in attempted terrorist attacks, including against aircraft and for targeted assassinations. The device never presented a threat to public safety, and the US government is working closely with international partners to address associated concerns with the device.&quot; The FBI is investigating whether it was possible for such a device to pass through airport security and, if so, whether it was capable of bringing down a plane. Controversy has surrounded the use by US security services of &quot;sting&quot; operations aimed at potential bombers within America. Human rights groups have accused the security services of behaving like agent provocateurs. Sting operations have also been used in Central and South America but appear to be less frequent in the Middle East. Hayden said Obama had been informed of the plot in April by John Brennan, his homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser, and was regularly updated. &quot;While the president was assured that the device did not pose a threat to the public, he directed the department of homeland security and law enforcement and intelligence agencies to take whatever steps necessary to guard against this type of attack,&quot; Hayden said. The president had thanked the intelligence and counter-terrorism experts involved &quot;for their outstanding work and for serving with the extraordinary skill and commitment that their enormous responsibilities demand,&quot; Hayden added. AP said that US officials suspect alleged bomb-maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri of manufacturing the bomb, as well as the one used in the 2009 underwear plot and two others built into printer cartridges and shipped to the US on cargo planes in\u00a02010. On Sunday, Fahd al-Quso, who was on the FBI wanted list, indicted for his alleged role in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen, was killed by a US drone in the southern Shabwa province of Yemen. Quso was alleged to have been involved in the 2009 underwear bombing. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula confirmed that he had been killed. In a statement, it said he had been a martyr after an American bombing and that another al-Qaida fighter had been killed alongside him. They had been travelling in a car at the time. Matt Chandler, a spokesman for the department of homeland security, said the latest plot &quot;demonstrates our adversaries&apos; interest in targeting the aviation sector&quot;. Security forces would continue to employ a series of layers of protection, he said. &quot;These layers include threat and vulnerability analysis, prescreening and screening of passengers using the best available technology, random searches at airports, federal air marshal coverage, and additional security measures both seen and unseen,&quot; Chandler added.", "sentences": ["In 2009, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian, attempted to detonate plastic explosives hidden in his underwear on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit."], "title": "Al-Qaida airline bomb plot thwarted by CIA", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/08/al-qaida-airline-bomb-plot", "tags": ["Al-Qaida", "Yemen", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "CIA", "US news", "FBI", "Air transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-08T11:00:01Z", "article": "I remember once, when on a visit to Amsterdam, I noticed in one of its narrower streets a church and a brothel so closely opposed to each other that I could just about have stood with one foot in the knocking-shop&apos;s doorway and the other in the church&apos;s. I wondered how the ecclesiastical authorities, even in such a liberal-minded country, could have accommodated such proximity. Well, now I know: because there have been links between the church and prostitution since well before Christian times. And in Christian times, even the church&apos;s famously anti-sex attitude led, paradoxically, to some strange and striking compromises; for example, there were prostitutes in 15th-century Strasbourg, known as &quot;swallows&quot;, who worked in the cathedral&apos;s bell tower; in 1608, the Dominicans of Perpignan &quot;collected alms from their congregations for the refurbishment of the order&apos;s bordello&quot;. These are, though, by no means the weirdest parts of Berkowitz&apos;s extraordinary book. We begin, as all histories of human civilisation must, in ancient Mesopotamia, where we learn that, pace L\u00e9vi-Strauss, incest is not the universal taboo we hold it to be. In Egypt, the practice was so encouraged that you could actually get into trouble if you didn&apos;t marry your sister. It took the Romans three centuries to eradicate the custom. When something as irrational as sex comes up against something as self-proclaimedly &quot;rational&quot; (ha!) as the law, then the law is going to be made to look pretty silly: that is the underlying message of this book. Not that this would be any comfort to you if, say, you were about to be severely punished for the crime of having been raped, as was not only common across much of the world for millennia, but persists today in those parts still governed by bigotry and religious mania. It is funny, but quietly instructive, how those most exercised about the sexual incontinence of others go to such great lengths to seek it out or incite it, as a quick look at the methods of the 19th-century Society for the Suppression of Vice would quickly confirm. Berkowitz, a lawyer-cum-journalist, has used both his skills to extremely good effect. This is a book that could so easily have been either too smirkingly knowing or too dry. Early on, when comparing Mosaic law with that of the earlier Middle Assyrians, and noting almost identical concern about what should happen if a woman attacks a man&apos;s balls when fighting, Berkowitz observes that Deuteronomy was not necessarily dictated by God, but that &quot;it appears that this Hebrew law was a reflection of a regional testicle fixation&quot;. On almost every page, Berkowitz is prompted to make some similar droll comment, and here&apos;s the clever part: it is never done inappropriately or facetiously. Somehow he always gets the tone right. &quot;The only weapon against genital demands was moral will,&quot; he writes of Augustine&apos;s teachings regarding sex, &quot;but the smart money was always on the gonads.&quot; Even when one has all the information at one&apos;s disposal, laughter is an excellent way of getting the information to sink in. And there is much to laugh at; otherwise we&apos;d be weeping at the injustice of it all. Berkowitz&apos;s legal background would appear to have helped him churn through millennia of documents, from the days of cuneiform to the 20th century (where he stops: the noise of the present would drown out the past, he says; and there are plenty of examples which shed light on the idiocies and inconsistencies of today). I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever read such an entertaining historical work. It has the wisdom granted by perspective, without the condescension of someone who thinks we&apos;re wiser than our ancestors. Whether you want to fuel your indignation, or simply furnish yourself with enough jaw-dropping data to galvanise a hundred party conversations (&quot;Did you know that the single event that precipitated the fall of the Roman empire more than any other was the imprisonment of a popular homosexual charioteer in Thessalonica in 390AD?&quot;), you really must shell out for this book.

They are evidence of a shift in the fabric of our society; a shift that sees people so united through shared passion, they are willing to give up their time, expertise and resources for free. As any fan of cerebral advertising guru, Alan Moore, already knows, the internet&apos;s inherent sharabilility is returning us to a community-focused society that prizes &quot;we&quot; over &quot;me&quot;. Its highly conductive network satiates society&apos;s basic need to share, connect and create meaning. But how does this networked economy affect contemporary marketing? Not so long ago, marketing was all about communicating brand messages. But today&apos;s brands and media owners \u2013 assuming there&apos;s still a distinction between the two \u2013 need to establish mutually beneficial networks if they want to thrive. If you don&apos;t give people what they want, the Internet offers another way of getting it. So customers are becoming competitors; and you&apos;re better off &quot;employing&quot; them by pulling them into your network. Starbucks launched a new concept store in March 2012 as a place of innovation; a blueprint for future stores. The Amsterdam store is a showcase for sustainable interior design and master coffee brewing. Its aesthetics are stunning: a multi-level space awash with recycled and local materials. It features walls lined with antique Delft tiles, bicycle inner tube and wooden gingerbread moulds, and undulating ceiling relief of repurposed Dutch oak. Liz Muller, Starbucks concept design director, commissioned more than 35 artists and craftsmen to add quirky touches to the 4,500-square-foot space. Impressive stuff. But Starbucks missed a trick. Had they taken a bottom-up approach, the retailer would have connected to an invaluable network of local and enthusiastic advocates, while simultaneously creating a sense of community uplift. By tapping into wider social trends, such as high street closures and job austerity, Starbucks could have created flagship community cafes run by previously unemployed but creative youths. These cafes would extend their reach by acting as micro-community centres for people to show their creative work, run exhibitions and perhaps even workshops about the craft of coffee brewing. If brands involve local communities, projects morph into what the community needs. Building and involving communities requires more than just listening, but the results are invaluable: greater innovation while the marketing gets baked into the brand through genuine advocacy. Starbucks may have missed an opportunity to connect to the networked economy, but others are already getting hooked. Local Motors, for example, used the internet to crowdsource the design of a powerful but fully road-legal desert rally car at a cost of $1.5m, compared to the usual $200m. The car went on to wow the Top Gear boys and was responsible for commentary such as: &quot;Just keep your head back against the headrest. We are going to fly about 15 feet in the air and travel about 75ft.&quot; But it&apos;s not just the car&apos;s design that&apos;s different. Buyers get put up in a hotel for six days while they help build the car in micro-manufacturing units before being taught to drive it. All for $77,000. Northface connected a community of athletes with its design teams. This collaboration resulted in products that can withstand the rigours of hardcore sports. But it&apos;s about more than just that. It&apos;s about the experience. Northface&apos;s savvy branding doesn&apos;t just focus on accomplishment, it focuses on the journey; something meaningful that we can all connect to. Big brands are also waking up to the networked economy; Ford being a great example. Its 48-part Facebook mini-series, The Explorer, taps into edgy sentiment through a narcissistic sock puppet that represents the antithesis of conformist America. The car manufacturer also cleverly involved a network of mums in the Ford Galaxy&apos;s redesign so as to further boost its family-friendly credentials. Most impressively, Ford is collaborating with Google&apos;s Prediction API to increase efficiency of hybrids by predicting where the car will go. Ford is turning the car into an opportunity for networked digital innovation; so much so, that it has opened a site in Silicon Valley to better connect with tech companies. Then there are the likes of Burberry and Dior who are connecting customers and their internal businesses end-to-end across the fashion world. Meanwhile, Lego works with its network of consumers to design and promote new Lego sets (Shaun of the Dead got our vote). And Coca-Cola \u2013 often perceived as a behemoth that, through its global monopoly, runs roughshod over communities in the developing world \u2013 used the 2012 Super Bowl to create one of the most socially engaging TV experiences to date. What unifies these examples? A clear social purpose to innovate against and drive value from. An engaged customer network connecting through shared interests and passions. Ongoing dialogues with customers built around valuable content. Customer involvement in product innovation. Connection between businesses, customers, suppliers and thought leaders. Get these right and you too could connect to the thriving networked economy.

JAB, the Vienna-based investment company owned by the four adopted children of Albert Reimann, is the largest shareholder in Reckitt, which owns brands such as Dettol, Strepsils and Nurofen, with a 15.5% stake. After the market closed on Wednesday, JAB said it intended to sell 36m Reckitt shares, equivalent to 4.9% of the company. Reckitt shares closed 11p higher at \u00a335.66. The placing will raise funds for the Avon deal. JAB owns 80% of Coty, which makes Calvin Klein fragrances and is run by former Reckitt boss Bart Becht. He is trying to persuade Avon shareholders to back a deal that would see the US cosmetics company pass into private ownership. Liberum Capital analyst Pablo Zuanic said: &quot;We see this as a way for JAB to help Coty fund the (unsolicited) bid for Avon or for other companies that Coty may decide to pursue ... Coty has made the right move in approaching Avon. There is no conflict on pricing (as long as direct selling does not undercut the trade) and in emerging markets direct sales can help advertise the brands over time.&quot; Avon, founded in 1886, has grown into the world&apos;s largest direct seller of cosmetics and sells a lipstick every four seconds. Coty was founded more than a century ago as a small perfume manufacturer on the outskirts of Paris and became the world&apos;s largest seller of mass-market fragrances in 2005 when it bought Unilever&apos;s perfume business. &quot;The sale of the placing shares reflects JAB&apos;s desire to diversify its portfolio and invest in new opportunities,&quot; said JAB. &quot;Reckitt Benckiser remains JAB&apos;s most important investment.&quot; The reclusive Reimanns inherited JAB (Joh A Benckiser) from their father and their combined wealth is estimated at about $20bn. Johann Adam Benckiser founded his eponymous chemical company in Pforzheim, Germany, in 1823 and was joined five years later by chemist Ludwig Reimann. JAB floated Benckiser, maker of Vanish and Cillit Bank, on the Amsterdam stock exchange in 1997. Two years later, the company merged with British firm Reckitt &amp; Colman to create Reckitt Benckiser. JAB stressed that it would retain its representative on Reckitt&apos;s board and a minimum shareholding of at least 10%. It said it was a &quot;strong believer&quot; in the company&apos;s new management team and its recently announced strategy. The investment firm committed not to sell any more Reckitt shares in the next 12 months after the completion of the placing. Bank of America Merrill Lynch will sell the shares to institutional shareholders. The price has not been determined. Reckitt&apos;s new chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor, wants to focus on emerging markets, along with health and hygiene. His target is to generate half of the group&apos;s sales from emerging markets by 2016.

In other management changes announced at the Amsterdam-based group on Friday, the chair and chief executive of Endemol France, Virginie Calmels, was appointed chief operating officer of Endemol Group. Both Hincks and Calmels join the Endemol Group management board. Along with Big Brother, which was picked up in the UK by Channel 5 after it was dropped by Channel 4, Endemol shows include the Channel 4 gameshows Deal Or No Deal and The Million Pound Drop Live, Charlie Brooker&apos;s comedy drama Black Mirror and the BBC1 quiz Pointless. Endemol slashed its debt earlier this year after reaching an agreement with the majority of its lenders to restructure its finances. It had global revenues of \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in 2011, up 10% on the previous year, with scripted programming sales up 34%. It said it had &quot;significant growth&quot; in revenues and profits in the first quarter of 2012.

He puts down the fork and motions for someone to ease him out of his chair and on to the dancefloor. &quot;That&apos;s a foxtrot,&quot; he says, raising his index finger in recognition of the big band music that has just started up. &quot;That&apos;s my sort of dance.&quot; The 78-year-old retired electrical engineer who has a form of dementia, probably Alzheimer&apos;s, takes his cue from a carer and suddenly his laboured shuffle has disappeared and they are gliding across the parquet floor. He hums to the familiar music, his eyes wide and smiling. At the Dance Cafe Wilhelmine in the south-eastern Berlin district of Kreuzberg about 20 elderly people \u2013 the oldest is 98 \u2013 have been brought together to escape for a few hours the dementia that shapes their lives, trapping them in a sequenceless limbo. &quot;Music is like a silver bullet for those with dementia,&quot; says Christa Matter, psychologist and manager of Berlin&apos;s Alzheimer&apos;s Society, which hosts the dances every month. &quot;People with dementia are constantly being told they can&apos;t do this, they&apos;re doing that wrong, but when they&apos;re dancing they can suddenly move with much more confidence, they know the steps, the music triggers something in them. They might not remember the names of their spouses or children any more, but they haven&apos;t forgotten how to dance.&quot; &quot;The dance cafe makes them feel validated as people again,&quot; she adds. &quot;It gives them the sense that &apos;I still exist&apos; as a person.&quot; These theories have been endorsed by the American neurologist Oliver Sacks who, in Musicophilia, his study of music and the human brain, talks of music&apos;s ability to transcend Alzheimer&apos;s. &quot;Music of the right kind can serve to orient and anchor a patient when almost nothing else can,&quot; he wrote. The tea dances, which take place across Germany, started several years ago. They were triggered initially by specialists&apos; recognition that patients with Alzheimer&apos;s were often able to recite poetry they had learned in the past \u2013 even if they could not otherwise speak. Psychologists worked on the theory that music might also belong to an almost indestructible form of memory even in those with advanced dementia. &quot;That turned out to be the case,&quot; says Matter. &quot;From what we observe here, it would seem that the response to music is preserved even when dementia is in a very progressed form.&quot; When Herbert returns from the dancefloor a carer dabs the sweat from his upper lip. He starts tucking into a half-eaten raspberry flan, until the carer intervenes: &quot;That&apos;s Ursula&apos;s.&quot; Little is known about Ursula Richter, who sits opposite dressed in a copper-threaded scarf with henna-dyed hair, lost in her own world, and says little. &quot;From photographs we know she was a good-time girl who travelled and danced a lot, and her wardrobe has lots of glitzy clothes in it,&quot; says her carer, Andrea M\u00fcller. Asked if she has always liked dancing, Ursula smirks and mutters the name of a Berlin cafe famous in the 1950s as a &quot;phone bar&quot; whose patrons used bakelite telephones on each table to flirt and make contact with each other. Then she points to Wolfschl\u00e4ger, with whom she is in a supervised flatshare, and says &quot;He&apos;s my boyfriend,&quot; and beckons him to dance with her to Tulips from Amsterdam. As the afternoon draws on, more snippets of the dancers&apos; lives emerge, piecemeal \u2013 randomly, but enough to give the impression of the people behind their ravaging disabilities. Sipping apple juice, Hildegard Gehrmann, who says she is in her early 20s but was in fact born in 1923, says: &quot;I dance at the Rose Theatre and at the Plaza.&quot; &quot;Polka, tango, foxtrot, you name it, though tap-dancing is my favourite.&quot; Her carers say she was indeed a professional dancer at the two leading Berlin variety theatres, which were both badly damaged during the second world war, and closed in 1944. Wollschl\u00e4ger taps his thigh as Besame Mucho starts up. &quot;Each time I cling to your kiss, I hear music divine, Besame mucho, Hold me my darling and say that you&apos;ll always be mine,&quot; sings Frank Sinatra, and Wollschl\u00e4ger starts talking about his wife, whose name he can no longer remember, and then about his time in the Hitler Youth movement, when they &quot;had parties for Uncle Adolf&quot;. This is Berlin after all and, like the city, all the dancers have a lot of their own history, much of which is prised open by the music as if it were a tin-opener to their memories. Some volunteer their memories of when the Berlin Wall went up, another, a Russian woman, tells how she met her soldier husband when he was in Stalingrad, a third talks of being expelled from Silesia as if it had happened yesterday. &quot;When we go dancing, they are simply more alert, much chattier and keener to make contact with others and with each other, and a lot of things come out,&quot; says M\u00fcller. Bettina Maier, a carer in an eight-woman flatshare, says that by the next day many of them will have forgotten they were ever at the cafe. &quot;We show them pictures of themselves, and sometimes they laugh and say: &apos;I&apos;m not that old lady!&apos;&quot; she says. Liese Steinbrinck, fragile and breathless off the dancefloor, but nimble and elegant as she waltzes to The Blue Danube, talks like a waterfall. Most of what the former haberdashery manager says makes no sense, and she appears to be sunk in a deep amnesia, until suddenly, as if she has had a flash of inspiration, she cups together her hands with their tissue-paper-thin skin and says: &quot;Best thing is not to stop because when I&apos;m here I&apos;m elsewhere.&quot; The power of a good tune  Music therapy for patients with dementia seems to exploit a difference in how our brains form, and perhaps retrieve, memories when information is carried in the words of a song or notes of a melody. The most common form of dementia, Alzheimer&apos;s disease, causes a steady and general decline in brain function. Its most obvious early symptom is memory loss. To process musical information our brains draw on a network that recruits from all over the brain, including parts that may be more slowly affected by Alzheimer&apos;s than those typically linked with memory. This has led researchers to suspect music can help form more robust memories than spoken information, possibly because the arousal of emotions through music aids the formation of stronger memories. In 2010 researchers at Boston University researchers found that when they trated patients with Alzheimer&apos;s and healthy older adults on their ability to remember phrases from sung or spoken lyrics. people with dementia recalled lyrics better when they were sung, while healthy older adults could recall both sung or spoken lyrics.

The overdue draft aviation policy is expected to be published this summer along with a call for evidence on hub airport capacity. Walsh and others, notably the airport operator BAA, have long argued that a hub airport \u2013 one sufficiently large to allow connecting passengers to fill long-haul routes \u2013 is crucial and that Heathrow, Britain&apos;s only hub, is no longer big enough to allow flights to new destinations. As the owner of British Airways and Spain&apos;s Iberia, IAG is the largest airline group at Heathrow. Walsh said: &quot;When I hear the government talking about an intelligent use of capacity at Heathrow \u2013 they have no idea what they are talking about. This is the government that cancelled the third runway. They don&apos;t know what they are talking about. I&apos;ve no confidence that this government will able to meet the challenge.&quot; Walsh questioned whether the consultation would be &quot;real&quot;, saying: &quot;If they close off options before they start, I don&apos;t see the merit in engaging with it.&quot; The coalition has ruled out a third Heathrow runway, and last week the transport secretary, Justine Greening, said &quot;mixed mode&quot; \u2013 allowing takeoffs and landings on the same runway \u2013 would also not be considered. However, Greening said the government would look at other, unspecified ways of maximising Heathrow&apos;s capacity. George Osborne, the chancellor, has said the government will explore all options for maintaining Britain&apos;s airport hub capacity with the exception of a third runway at Heathrow. Walsh said: &quot;We need to be honest and mature \u2013 if you&apos;re going to have a consultation, to say you&apos;re eliminating options before you start doesn&apos;t seem mature or really serious.&quot; Greening has promised a fast process and said she will set out a timeline for action as part of the call for evidence on hub airports, which she hoped would be &quot;a more informed debate with a little less heat and more light&quot;. Walsh said: &quot;They&apos;ve been giving that answer for two years \u2013 there isn&apos;t any credibility in this government. They should turn round and say: &apos;You know what, we don&apos;t know what we&apos;re doing.&apos; Then we&apos;d know where they stand.&quot; Walsh, who is taking a delegation of businessmen to China this weekend to explore export opportunities, said the lack of airport capacity in the UK was harming British business. &quot;China isn&apos;t just about Beijing and Shanghai but growth opportunities in cities most people don&apos;t know the names of. You can fly to them from Paris and Amsterdam and even Helsinki, and yet we&apos;re trying to convince ourselves that this is an opportunity for the UK. It&apos;s not, because we can&apos;t connect. Longer-term it&apos;s going to have real consequences for the UK.&quot; On Friday IAG announced an operating loss of \u20ac249m (\u00a3200m) for the first quarter of 2012, compared with a \u20ac102m loss for the same period last year. Walsh said the &quot;underlying performance was pretty good&quot; but there had been a massive increase in the fuel bill, up 25% to \u20ac1.4bn. He admitted that Iberia&apos;s operating performance was poor, but said long-term the Spanish airline would not drag down its merged partner British Airways. &quot;Long-term, the economic situation in Spain will be difficult but will improve, and the restructuring we&apos;re doing ourselves in Iberia will benefit the business.&quot; Walsh said arbitration should mean no imminent repeat of strikes by Iberia pilots that hit IAG profits. He anticipated that a restructured bmi, whose purchase by IAG from Lufthansa was cleared last month, would be profitable by 2014. &quot;We&apos;ve got a big job to do \u2013 the scale of losses were huge. But we know what we need to do.&quot; He held out little hope for bmibaby, however, despite ongoing talks and the sale of the other bmi airline, bmi Regional, this week. &quot;We&apos;re talking to people and actively seeking a buyer, but I&apos;m not confident of our ability to sell,&quot; Walsh said.

The Guardian has learned from Saudi sources that the agent was not a Saudi national as was widely reported, but a Yemeni. He was born in Saudi Arabia, in the port city of Jeddah, and then studied and worked in the UK, where he acquired a British passport. Mike Scheur, the former head of the CIA&apos;s Bin Laden unit, said the leaking about the nuts and bolts of British involvement was despicable and would make a repeat of the operation difficult. &quot;MI6 should be as angry as hell. This is something that the prime minister should raise with the president, if he has the balls. This is really tragic,&quot; Scheur said. He added: &quot;Any information disclosed is too much information. This does seem to be a tawdry political thing.&quot; He noted that the leak came on the heels of a series of disclosures over the last 10 days, beginning with a report that the CIA wanted to expand its drone attacks in Yemen, Barack Obama making a surprise trip to Afghanistan around the time of the Bin Laden anniversary and &quot;then this inexplicable leak&quot;. Robert Grenier, former head of the CIA counter-terrorism centre, said: &quot;As for British Intelligence, I suppose, but do not know, that they must be very unhappy. They are often exasperated, quite reasonably, with their American friends, who are far more leak-prone than they. &quot;In their place, I would think two and three times before sharing with the Americans, and then only do it if I had to. The problem with that dynamic is that you don&apos;t know what you don&apos;t know, and what opportunities you might be missing when you decide not to share. The Americans are doing a very good job of undermining trust, and the problem starts at the top.&quot; The name of the British passport-holder has not yet been released but may come out through al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. He is reported to have spent time at at language school in Sana&apos;a, the Yemeni capital, and been recruited by al-Qaida as a suicide bomber. Mustafa Alani of the Gulf Research Centre in Dubai told CNN that the bomber had been recruited by the Saudis to penetrate al-Qaida about a year ago, in part because the group would be attracted by the fact that his UK passport meant he could travel to the US without a visa. &quot;Apparently he was able to convince al-Qaida that he is genuinely ready to carry out the mission,&quot; said Alani, who CNN said had been briefed by Saudi counter-terrorism officials. Alani said his understanding was that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (Aqap) intended the would-be suicide bomber to fly through a Gulf country to connect to a US-bound flight. The Saudi operation culminated with the agent and another Saudi informant \u2013 likely his handler \u2013 being whisked out of Yemen, Alani said. &quot;My information is that he was pulled out after the device was handed to him, and they ordered the green light to carry out the operation,&quot; he told the US network. Yemen has been a key target country for the CIA and MI6 in line with the growing strength of Aqap in recent years. But the lead on the ground has been taken by the Saudi intelligence service, the Mabahith, which is best placed to operate in the local environment and exploit links on either side of the border. Both the US and British intelligence communities are known to work closely with their Saudi counterparts and both have liaison officers permanently stationed in Riyadh and Sana&apos;a.  Aqap moved its operations to Yemen in 2007 after the defeat of al-Qaida in Saudi Arabia. The Nigerian &quot;underwear bomber&quot;, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit in 2009, was radicalised in Yemen while claiming to be there as a student. The US, Britain and the Saudis are likely to have preferred their own intelligence operation to co-operation with the Yemeni security authorities, who are anxious to avoid being seen as a western pawn.  Cables released by WikiLeaks exposed the scale of US covert involvement in the Arab world&apos;s poorest country. In 2009 the Saudi deputy interior minister, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, told General James Jones, President Obama&apos;s national security adviser: &quot;The Saudis have been monitoring conversations of al-Qaida operatives in Yemen very closely and whereas before the [recent] attack they were hearing relaxed 20-minute phone conversations over cellphones, after the attack the phones went virtually silent. This suggests that at least for now these operatives are more focused on their own security rather than on planning operations.&quot; Bin Nayef&apos;s support for operations against Aqap is unsurprising. He survived an assassination attempt in Jeddah in September 2009 when a Saudi Aqap operative named Abdullah al-Asiri feigned repentance for his jihadi views in a meeting with the prince then blew himself up with a bomb concealed in his anus. Al-Asiri&apos;s brother Ibrahim is Aqap&apos;s chief bombmaker. Gregory Johnsen, a US expert on Aqap, pondered on his blog whether the group would now reveal the identity of the undercover agent. &quot;Undoubtedly, Aqap recorded a marytrdom video of the undercover agent before giving him the bomb,&quot; Johnsen wrote. &quot;The US and Saudis won&apos;t divulge his identity for obvious reasons, but will Aqap?&quot;", "sentences": ["The Nigerian &quot;underwear bomber&quot;, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit in 2009, was radicalised in Yemen while claiming to be there as a student."], "title": "Underwear bomb plot: British and US intelligence rattled over leaks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/11/underwear-bomb-plot-mi6-cia-leaks", "tags": ["US news", "World news", "CIA", "MI6", "MI5", "UK news", "Yemen", "Saudi Arabia"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-11T21:45:08Z", "article": "Bologna Bologna is lively, studenty and has beautiful medieval buildings, not to mention great food.

Steffi cut her teeth as a DJ in Amsterdam, where she co-founded the playful electro label Klakson in 2000. Moving to Berlin in 2007, she soon won a residency at the legendary Panorama Bar. Her debut album Yours &amp; Mine was released on the club&apos;s in-house label Ostgut Ton last year, affirming her commitment to combining the dazzle of New York house with the drive and precision of Berlin techno. Huxley, on the other hand, is a young baseball-capped Brit whose love for speed garage is evident from his recent Fact Magazine mix, which features two RIP productions as well as Wookie&apos;s classic Storm. His own material, whether solo or in tandem with fellow Brit-house up-and-comer Ethyl, displays similar flair. Tsuba boss Kevin Griffiths warms the pot. Secret location, Sat Sam Richards Back Tae Mine, Glasgow Despite the Scots accent required for correct pronunciation of its name, it should be apparent what&apos;s on offer here; it&apos;s a night out for those awkward types who don&apos;t particularly enjoy clubbing or house parties, and in fact prefer spending a Saturday night at home in front of the telly. Described as a club night with the vibe of a house party, it goes above and beyond its remit of pleasing some of the people all of the time with a playlist devoid of the sort of obscure tracks much beloved by chin-strokers and musical elitists. Resident DJs Gavin Dunbar, Sci-Fi Steve and the Superfly DJs ensure that every song played, whether it&apos;s from the indie-friendly genres of northern soul, funk, rock, pop, punk, hip-hop, indie, Motown or new wave, is nothing less than a tried-and-tested floorfiller. Unlike a house party, there&apos;s always a wide selection of beers, wines and spirits and, unlike your average nightclub, they also serve a nice cup of tea or coffee and even a lovely slice of free toast. Flying Duck, Renfield Street, Sat Patric Baird Future Everything, Manchester &amp; Salford Although it&apos;s mainly an art festival, there&apos;s much for dance/electronic music fans to enjoy at Future Everything. Taking place across Manchester and Salford, the festival opens with hip-hop group Shabazz Palaces at Islington Mill followed by an evening of minimal electronica and techno there with Canadian artist Deadbeat playing live. Matthew Herbert&apos;s One Pig show at RNCM on Friday is a thought-provoking piece using sounds of a pig&apos;s life, death and consumption. Next Saturday&apos;s finale includes a stunning 3D show by Ninja Tune&apos;s Amon Tobin and club night Bohemian Grove, where electro crew Claro Intelecto join Detroit DJ Mike Huckaby. Various venues, Wed to 19 May Marc Rowlands Night Slugs, London It&apos;s just over four years since Alex &quot;Bok Bok&quot; Sushon and James &quot;L-Vis 1990&quot; Connolly first got together as Night Slugs to mix grime, ghetto house and bassline. That blend of antsy urban dance soon congealed into a Night Slugs sound, best heard on their label&apos;s stellar run of singles. More recently they&apos;ve focused on full-length releases, and the next artist to drop an album for the label is Phil &quot;Girl Unit&quot; Gamble, the man responsible for official Night Slugs anthem Wut. Last time Phil played Crucifix Lane, he was forced to rewind Wut three times; let&apos;s hope his new stuff elicits a similar response. Crucifix Lane, SE1, Fri SR Maxxi Soundsystem, Brighton As the three-day musical bender that is the Great Escape comes to a close there&apos;s still just enough energy to enjoy Sam Watts and his marvellous Maxxi Soundsystem. Bashing all the right future disco buttons and producing fine slabs of dreamy minimalism, an impressive round of club nights and festivals over the last few years has proved the popularity of Maxxi&apos;s mixture of self-produced edits, remixes and classics.

Each film is enough to disturb; together they are peculiarly subversive. I do not know exactly what they might mean to Jewish, Israeli or Palestinian viewers, still less to a Polish audience watching some of the scenes unfolding on the site of the Warsaw Ghetto itself. But my sense is that an anxious concern for other people&apos;s reactions is at least part of the trilogy&apos;s content. In the first film, Nightmares (2007), a political leader strides into a Warsaw stadium to rally the crowds. &quot;Let the 3\u00a0million Jews that Poland has missed\u2026 return to Poland, to your country,&quot; he urges, acknowledging Poland&apos;s antisemitic history but arguing that Jews and Poles should come together once more to extinguish the hatred. But to whom does he speak: the Jews of modern Israel or the Jews of the past, murdered or vanished into exile? Apart from a small band of pioneers, there is nobody there. And time is flowing in both directions. For though he addresses the future, this man is standing in the past, in Warsaw&apos;s old Decennial Stadium, weed-choked and derelict, its heroic protests against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia long forgotten; unless they are still to come. For the film reprises Leni Riefenstahl&apos;s Triumph of the Will (1935), as if the Holocaust had not yet happened. In the second film, Wall and Tower, now dressed as Jewish immigrants to 1930s Palestine, the pioneers build a settlement on the site of the Warsaw Ghetto. The digging of the foundations exactly resembles the digging of graves; the stockade is identical to a watchtower. What are they building, a settlement to keep people out, a kibbutz or another barbed-wire death camp? The settlers eventually rest on the grass. Filmed from above, they resemble a heap of dead bodies. In the final part of the trilogy, the leader has been assassinated. Vast crowds attend his state funeral. A grey Soviet-style effigy has been erected and the eulogies are given in its shadow, along with further calls for a return to the homeland \u2013 but which? By now, that might equally be Poland or Israel. Bartana was born in Israel in 1970 and educated in Amsterdam and New York. She won the 2010 Artes Mundi Prize for her explorations of Israeli national consciousness. Her films are stunningly well made, as they have to be in this case to appear immediately simple yet ultimately complex. To begin with, every symbol irresistibly recalls another and every analogy seems clear: foundations and graves, idealists and demagogues, Polish and German eagles, Communist and Nazi rallies. The armbands and vertical banners of the state funeral could speak of several 20th-century nations, and indeed the second film is set to both the Polish and Israeli anthems. Both songs yearn for freedom for the people of the land; each has a sense of pride based on national distinction. Indeed, the third film, which rings with opposing views, raises the question of whether the Jews who settled in what became Israel were so different from anyone else in a century of nationalism. But then again, Nationalism = Terror according to a funeral banner. Every scene has its historic counterpart by association or inversion: that is the obvious interpretation. But the experience of watching these films as works of art is altogether different. Each feels like a trauma played out in the form of a nightmare, plausible, sequential, even logical until the sleeper awakes, baffled and horrified by what he or she saw. How is it possible for Polish antisemitism to have persisted after the Holocaust that took place on its soil? How is it possible for Israel to have occupied Palestinian territory? Here is the sleep of reason. Bartana&apos;s films swim between fact and fiction. They move seamlessly from one genre to another, from documentary to biopic to Riefenstahl. The performances are remarkable, especially that of the leader Slawomir Sierakowski \u2013 both patently a performance (he is occasionally seen dropping his eyes to a script) and yet somehow authentic. Everything appears both real and unreal. Study the credits and you will find that this is profoundly true, that the actors performing the roles are also playing themselves. Slawomir Sierakowski really is a Polish political thinker, the writer Alona Frankel really did flee Poland in the 1950s and return to Warsaw to play herself in the Polish trilogy, and those multicultural crowds really have come to hear the speeches at Sierakowski&apos;s &quot;funeral&quot; because they are involved in JRMiP, the Jewish Renaissance Movement in Poland. As for this movement, one has assumed it to be a fiction all the way through, a hallucination conceived as part of the drama. Yet it has a website, a manifesto, a conference and enough followers to fill a vast Warsaw square. By the end of the cycle, with its superb\u00a0performances and poetic shifts of idiom, its time games and its haunting soundtrack of distant voices, one is no longer so certain of the movement&apos;s status. After all, if so many Israelis have their ancestral roots in Poland, and Poland is so prepared to back Bartana that it chose her trilogy as its official entry to the last Venice Biennale , then perhaps there is something to the JRMiP. That idea is raised, however briefly, however absurdly, to make one think hard even as Bartana&apos;s films portray the agonising complexity of Polish-Jewish history. Elizabeth Price is as committed an artist, in her way, as Yael Bartana. But her thoughts are devoted to cultural history, and to modernism in particular. Several of the films in her Baltic show \u2013 shortlisted for this year&apos;s Turner prize \u2013 scrutinise modernist pieties. I particularly liked At The House of Mr X, in which the words of an unseen guide, arriving on the screen in motion script, take us round the pristine former home of the make-up magnate who gave us Outdoor Girl gloss and Miners Smokey Eyes. The guide becomes badly over-excited by the juxtaposition of Mies van der Rohe chairs and shot-silk foundation, Achille Castiglioni lamps and Mercury Dust eyeshadow. Eventually they become whipped together in a whirl of words and images so that each becomes newly bizarre: the furniture and faces of two eras brought strangely together. The Baltic has some of Price&apos;s more theoretical works but it is also showing her most popular film, User Group Disco, a droll black-and-white blend of B-movie, French critical theory and Antiques Roadshow, in which bric-a-brac revolves on a turntable to a script of pompous rhetoric from sociology to software. Words and images are deftly spliced to satirise the sinister and accentuate the positive. It made me think of Ferdinand L\u00e9ger&apos;s dynamic 1924 film Ballet M\u00e9canique.", "sentences": ["Bartana was born in Israel in 1970 and educated in Amsterdam and New York."], "title": "Yael Bartana: And Europe Will Be Stunned; Elizabeth Price: Here \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/13/art-exhibition", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Culture", "Film", "Video art", "Turner prize 2012"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-15T09:59:03Z", "article": "The story of Zola Budd\u2019s involvement in the 1984 Olympics is the tale of three races, each extraordinary in their own way, held in the space of six months. Two of them took place on a running track, the third around the corridors and meeting rooms of Downing Street, Whitehall and Fleet Street.   Related: Ten to watch: meet Team GB's sporting superheroes    The first was run on a vicious, windy night in Stellenbosch in January 1984, when Budd introduced herself to the world with a stunning performance over 5,000m. A tiny, fragile young woman of 17, her vulnerability magnified by her preference for running barefoot, her time of 15min 1.95sec shattered the world record, held by America\u2019s Mary Decker, by more than six seconds. Because she was South African the International Association of Athletics Federations refused to ratify the time, but she nevertheless suddenly found herself among the most talked-about athletes in the world. In the weeks that followed at least nine American universities attempted to woo her with offers of scholarships, as well as a handful in South Africa. Someone gave her a cow. Italy offered her citizenship. Henry Allen, a 65-year-old from Birmingham, proposed to her. \u201cI would just like to offer her the chance she deserves so much to compete in the Olympics and other international events,\u201d he explained, insisting that his offer was merely a novel if faintly romantic method of beating the apartheid-era sporting boycott. She turned him down, insisting: \u201cI think I am too young for marriage.\u201d She eventually accepted an offer from the University of the Orange Free State, \u201cbecause it is close to home\u201d, and continued to live with her parents Frank and Tossie on their farm near Bloemfontein. Pinned to her bedroom wall, famously, was a picture of her favourite athlete, Decker. With no end in sight for the boycott there seemed no chance of her competing against her idol. \u201cShe gets satisfaction from running world-best times,\u201d said Frank in February, \u201cbut that\u2019s not fulfilment. She would love to test herself against Mary Decker, but at the moment that\u2019s not possible.\u201d He decided to apply for a British passport, for which he qualified because his own father had been born in London. He hoped that doing so might enable his daughter to compete in the 1988 Olympics. The Mail\u2019s sports writer Ian Wooldridge included this information in a profile he wrote of Budd, and the paper\u2019s editor, David English, read it with glee. He sensed an opportunity to place his paper at the heart of the year\u2019s biggest sporting occasion, to publicise its unwavering patriotism, and to secure exclusive access to one of sport\u2019s rising stars. \u201cI can pick up this phone and get her a British passport in two days,\u201d he boasted to his staff, and promptly set about proving it. In fact it took 10. First he had to get the Budds on board, which he did by offering them a house, \u00a3100,000 in cash, a job for Frank, a lucrative deal for Zola to write an Olympic diary, and by promising to bring over her coach, Pieter Labuschagne. The family were flown to Amsterdam, and then by private jet to Southampton, whereupon they were held by the Mail in Guildford under virtual house arrest until she left for Los Angeles. At the time applications for British citizenship were normally processed within somewhere between 13 and 24 months. If his plan was to come off, English needed considerable assistance. Documents released in 2005 told the full story of how The Mail went about pressurising Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government into cooperation. It started with English summoning Neil MacFarlane, the sports minister, for a meeting. \u201cHe left me in no doubt last night that he is prepared to use all his contacts to secure entry for Zola Budd,\u201d MacFarlane reported, \u201cand we can expect a Daily Mail crusade.\u201d Many ministers were against the idea. Geoffrey Howe, the foreign secretary, wrote a letter to the Home Secretary, Leon Brittan. \u201cI know that Sir David English has been pressing very hard for this,\u201d he wrote, \u201c[but] the whole question of sport and South Africa is a political minefield ... We need to be careful to avoid giving the appearance of an unseemly rush.\u201d The British ambassador to South Africa thought it a terrible idea, and Howe wrote to tell him about \u201cstrong domestic political considerations which have influenced ministers\u201d. Another note from the Foreign Office complained that \u201cHome Office decisions ... appear to have been taken under pressure from the Daily Mail.\u201d On 6 April, three weeks after The Mail started their campaign and 10 days after they submitted her application on her behalf, Brittan announced that Budd was to get her passport. The move infuriated anti-apartheid protesters, who felt it \u201copened the gate for white South Africans\u201d to compete internationally and camped noisily outside her house. The Labour shadow minister for sport, Denis Howell, raged about the \u201cindecent haste\u201d with which the application was processed and demanded an investigation into the role of The Mail. \u201cI think it is an outrage that, in the interests of a newspaper stunt, procedures of one of the highest departments of state can be manipulated,\u201d he said. Despite this political storm, Budd swiftly proved that the hype about her athletic ability was more than justified. She won her first race on British soil, over 3,000m in Dartford, well inside the Olympic qualifying time. \u201cI am happy in England,\u201d she said, before being hastened away by a Daily Mail employee. She then broke the British junior record for the 1,500m at Crystal Palace but burst into tears after being jeered at the finish \u2013 Thatcher described the abuse as \u201cutterly appalling and a disgrace to those who meted it out\u201d. \u201cThe first sight of this phenomenal tiny tot was fascinating,\u201d wrote Frank Keating in The Guardian. \u201cThe top of her head barely came up to the chests of her rivals. But there was only the first lap for comparisons \u2013 by then she was off and away.\u201d The International Olympic Committee accepted her Britishness \u2013 even if many of the athletes competing with her for a place on the plane to Los Angeles, such as the suddenly-displaced British No1 Wendy Sly, did not. There was nothing they nor anyone else could do once Budd had started June with victory at the British Olympic trials at Crystal Palace, running barefoot and breaking the European junior record in the process. Although her impact had been so great that Decker felt forced to schedule a race the week before they were to meet in LA simply to prove that she could better Budd\u2019s famous 5,000m time (she could), the young South African was not widely regarded as a medal contender. \u201cI will be very honest with you, she is not in the same class as Mary Decker,\u201d Labuschagne said. \u201cIn the next Olympics it will be very different, but at the moment, this expectation of her is worrying me every day. All I expect from Zola is to run in the Olympic final \u2013 that will be a good performance.\u201d She never looked like failing to achieve that much, coming third in a heat she led until the final lap, but eventually finished well behind the impressive Romanian Maricica Puica. She was joined in the final by Sly, desperate to beat her new rival, and by Decker. Budd would meet her idol at last. And so to the eight minutes that will always define her. Decker took the lead from the start, and at the end of the first lap Budd appeared on her shoulder, where she would remain for the next three laps. Puica and Sly kept pace with them, and the four slowly pulled clear of the rest. Coming up to the four-lap mark Budd made her move, pulling ahead of Decker and tucking into the inside of the track, in front of the American. Budd\u2019s slightly unkempt running style, elbows flailing wide of her body, made her more difficult to pass than most women of her fragile build, but Decker was simply trying to keep up when the pair\u2019s legs briefly tangled. Decker fell, landing just off the track. Budd glanced to her left, slowing slightly, saw her rival on the floor, and ran on. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. It was terrible. I wanted to stop. I wanted it all to end,\u201d she wrote in The Mail later that week. \u201cAnd, in truth, the race for me was really over. Instinctively, I kept on running. When you\u2019ve trained for thousands of miles, you don\u2019t just quit.\u201d Moments later she retook the lead, and that\u2019s when she heard it. \u201cAt that point I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d done anything wrong. Then I heard the boos,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI had had crowd trouble before, and faced booing from small groups of spectators who wanted to play politics with sport. But I\u2019d never let it worry me or affect my running. But this was different. This seemed to be the whole Olympic stadium. The booing came down like a tidal wave of concentrated hostility. It was like being punched in the stomach. More than ever I wanted to stop and for the whole thing to end. What I really wanted at that point was to go somewhere and hide, but there was nowhere to go, so I had to keep running.\u201d Budd, Puica and Sly stretched their lead over the field, looking certain to divide the medals between them, but in the last lap Budd faded badly. She eventually finished seventh, while Puica won by 20 yards from a jubilant Sly. In her autobiography, published in 1989, Budd insisted that her transformation over the last lap from potential winner to also-ran had been entirely deliberate. \u201cI had to finish the race,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat I couldn\u2019t endure, however, was the thought of facing all those people on the rostrum. It sounds easy to say, but I knew once the race had started that I was good enough to win a silver or bronze medal. Deep inside me, though, was now a dread of standing on a rostrum, and I began running slower and slower. People passed me and I didn\u2019t care \u2013 everything had collapsed and I just wanted out.\u201d She was disqualified, briefly, but the Olympics\u2019 director of athletics decided \u201cthere was no foul\u201d and reinstated her. \u201cIn some races things happen that are nobody\u2019s fault,\u201d he said. Puica and several other athletes said that Decker was to blame. Needless to say, that wasn\u2019t how the American saw it. \u201cZola tripped me,\u201d Decker said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any question that she was in the wrong. I hold her responsible for what happened.\u201d Decker left the press conference, as she had left the track, weeping and relying on her husband, the British discus thrower Richard Slaney, for physical support. By the time Budd returned to Britain three days later she had received so many death threats that a team of armed police met her at the airport. She didn\u2019t stay long \u2013 soon she fled to South Africa, and it took significant arm-twisting to bring her back to the UK at all. She continued to represent her adoptive country for a few years, winning a couple of world cross country titles and breaking the world record for the 5,000m (again), but losing a high-profile and extremely lucrative rematch against Decker in 1985. Her aim was to win a medal in Seoul in 1988, but at the start of that year the IOC demanded that she be banned from sport for attending \u2013 not competing in, simply standing near \u2013 two races in South Africa. She fought the ban for a while, before declaring in May that she was suffering from nervous exhaustion, and giving up. Her Olympic ambitions ruined, she returned to South Africa for good. Budd returned to the Olympics in 1992, competing as a South African, when illness prevented her reaching her potential and she failed to reach the 5,000m final. Now 45, Budd continues to run over ever increasing distances, completing the 56km Two Oceans Marathon in Cape Town last month and entering herself for the 89km Comrades ultra-marathon, between Pietermaritzburg and Durban, in June. \u201cI love my running,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think my life would be complete without it.\u201d Throughout the build-up to the Los Angeles Games, The Mail had reported in a series of exclusives how delighted Budd had been with her new life in Britain, but the truth was that while she was building her athletic reputation, her personal life was crumbling around her. While Frank loved life in Britain, she and her mother were desperately homesick. Within two years, the Budds\u2019 33-year marriage was over. When Zola discovered weeks before the Games that her father had helped himself to rather too much of The Mail money, their relationship broke down as well. He was ordered not to travel to Los Angeles, was not there to witness her marriage in 1989, and by the time he was murdered a few months later he had written into his will that Zola should not come to his funeral, or be buried alongside him on the family plot. In her autobiography Budd thought back to that night at the start of 1984, and to the performance in Stellenbosch which was to change her life for ever, a single race that had brought an enormous financial windfall and an unforeseen opportunity to compete in Los Angeles. \u201cI have always told people that it was about the worst thing that could have happened to me, as it resulted in four years of trauma with a handful of bright spots in between,\u201d she wrote. \u201c5 January 1984 was probably the worst day of my life.\u201d What the Guardian saidAug 13th 1984Landing with a costly bumpJohn Rodda The too-long summer for Zola Budd left her burnt out in the Coliseum in Friday\u2019s 3,000 metres final. She had attempted to carry on running in the South African summer to racing in that of the northern hemisphere, without a break; toughened New Zealanders like John Walker and Rod Dixon have found it difficult at times, so it was asking a lot of a tiny 17-year-old. The circumstances of her transformation from South Africa to the Olympic arena, by a touch of Leon Brittan\u2019s wand and a pumpkin coach ordered by the Daily Mail made her task more difficult. Coping with the physical pressure of the athletics was going to be a considerable task in itself; but surrounded by publicity and anti-publicity, and perched on top of a dangerous political spike, she responded marvellously. It must, of course, be extremely embarrassing for Sir David English, the editor of the Mail and Lord Rothermere, his boss, who were both out here in Los Angeles, to have a seventh placed runner on their books, rather than a medal winner. But Fleet Street is practised at turning a pig\u2019s ear into a velvet purse, and the manner of Mary Decker\u2019s exit from the event could not have been a better excuse to recoup some of their investment. A large part of America seems to have had a mental breakdown on the sight of Decker crashing to the track. Miss Budd\u2019s disqualification by the referee on the evidence of one judge is the single act of chauvinism in these Games of chauvinism to be \u2013 briefly \u2013 supported officially. Fortunately, the international Jury of Appeal looked at the matter, and put it back into proper perspective by voting 8-0 to reinstate the British runner to her proper place, seventh. The anguish of Mary Decker as she lay on the infield was not that of an Olympian nursing a lost cause, but of a client of Mark McCormack\u2019s who has allowed, through her own folly, a million dollars to slip away. Miss Decker was at fault. She is a vastly experienced runner who ought to have spotted, if she did not really know beforehand, that Miss Budd, for all her lack of height, has a long, awkward stride and big elbows. Mary Decker should not have been running so close to trouble, unless, as the Secretary of the International Athletic Federation, John Holt has hinted, she was trying to harass the British girl.   Related: Why US women are likely to outperform the men again at the Olympics    The Olympic athletics arena has its sprinkling of raw inexperienced runners, and the Americans, of all people, should know and remember it. Jim Ryun, a solid gold medal hope for the 1,500 metres in 1972, went tumbling out on a misplaced African leg. Miss Decker had plenty of opportunity to find space for herself, but she chose not to, and disaster overtook her. There are no definitive pictures of the incident; my interpretation is that after one brush of legs, Miss Decker put her hand out to steady herself and bumped the young Briton, who lurched to the right on the next stride. In doing so her left leg came up, which brought about what will henceforth be known as the Great Coliseum Collision. Miss Budd was already running out of running, and in the final lap she slipped back from second place to seventh. That is not the end of her story, or the Daily Mail\u2019s; but I prefer to remember her running on the streets of Oslo, battling away but losing to Ingrid Kristiansen and Grete Waltz. On that day there were no doubts about her courage, and her capability. In all the furore there is a forgotten lady \u2013 Wendy Sly of Britain, who ran on to take the silver medal, a marvellous performance after a recovery from the achilles tendon injury she suffered earlier this year.", "sentences": ["The family were flown to Amsterdam, and then by private jet to Southampton, whereupon they were held by the Mail in Guildford under virtual house arrest until she left for Los Angeles."], "title": "50 stunning Olympic moments No30: Zola Budd in 1984 | Simon Burnton", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/may/15/olympic-moments-zola-budd-1984", "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-15T14:46:17Z", "article": "As Fran\u00e7ois Hollande spends most of his first week as president of France flying from one important summit to another \u2013 from Berlin to Washington and on to Chicago \u2013 he will start to feel the immense pressure of high office, which he has previously been able only to imagine. His brutal baptism of fire, with the eyes of the world upon him, initiates the newcomer into a small club with a high casualty rate and, in 2012, the highest stakes since the end of the cold war. Summits have been around for centuries, at least since the Roman emperor Constantine summoned the bishops of Christendom to Nicaea in 325 to sort out their theological differences by consensus. The first great secular European settlement, to end the savage thirty years&apos; war, took five years to negotiate, at Westphalia in what is now northern Germany. It ushered in the &quot;Westphalian&quot; system of sovereign states, which endures. At Vienna in 1814-15, negotiating emperors self-importantly wasted so much time on elaborate dinners and balls that someone joked &quot;We need Napoleon back&quot;, to concentrate minds. By escaping from Elba to Waterloo, Bonaparte duly obliged: it did the trick. If it is any consolation to a novice such as Hollande, who has never previously held high executive office, he is in good company as he heads from his eurozone summit with Angela Merkel to Barack Obama&apos;s G8 summit (the 38th since 1975) and on to Nato&apos;s, in Chicago. Recession, not war and peace, is uppermost, as it was in the 30s until the Great Depression pushed war back up the agenda. When Stalin met his victorious allies at Potsdam \u2013 Berlin&apos;s Windsor \u2013 in July 1945, he was dealing with relative amateurs: the underrated Harry Truman was just three months into his presidency after succeeding FDR in the White House; and, halfway through the summit to settle the postwar world, Labour&apos;s understated Clem Attlee arrived after unexpectedly defeating Winston Churchill in the British general election. Stalin underestimated both, much as a later Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, would the callow young president John F Kennedy when they first met in Vienna in June 1961. A tense encounter, it made US-Soviet relations even worse and may have contributed to the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. When Ronald Reagan first met Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985, his affability outweighed &quot;evil empire&quot; instincts. In Reykjavik the following year, he almost negotiated away the entire US nuclear arsenal. When President Richard Nixon met Chairman Mao in Beijing in 1972 he was more experienced and better prepared. Yet Hollande must also know that experience is not everything when set against arrogance and hubris. The peacemakers who imposed their harsh settlement on Germany at Versailles in June 1919 were men of great age and experience. Yet the Daily Herald cartoonist Will Dyson portrayed France&apos;s implacable George Clemenceau saying as they left: &quot;Curious! I seem to hear a child weeping.&quot; With chilling prophecy, the naked child in the cartoon was labelled &quot;1940 Class&quot;. In 1979, Margaret Thatcher, previously only a former education secretary, had six weeks to prepare for her first EU summit in Strasbourg, though she had acquired some practice on the circuit as opposition leader, twice meeting her future buddy, Governor Reagan. In the event, her French EU host tried to stitch her up over Britain&apos;s budget rebate, &quot;so at my very first summit I had to say no&quot;, she recorded in her memoirs. But Thatcher got her way because the leaders were all hungry for dinner. Such is the stuff of summitry. At his own baptismal EU summit in Amsterdam, weeks after his 1997 election victory, Tony Blair won the leaders&apos; bicycle race and was hugely impressed by the way Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar of Spain refused to be bullied (France again) or bounced out of his negotiating position at the last minute. Blair was notoriously impatient with the protocols, compromises and minutiae of summit diplomacy, yet one of his most solid achievements, the Belfast agreement of 1998, was the product of such late-night haggling. The arrival of the jet age made jetsetting summits easier than in the days of horse, sail and steam; newer communications technology, which hooks up the world in real time, should have rendered them obsolete in turn. But the vanity of statesmen and the earnest desire of their citizens for televised handshakes that may \u2013 may \u2013 transform the lives of millions ensure they continue. Face-to-face contact is risky, but it can make a real difference: better to meet and disappoint than not to meet, Labour&apos;s Jim Callaghan used to say.

More than a century later, the same remark holds true. Conducted by Mariss Jansons, Zarathustra was the opening work of an all-Strauss programme for the second concert of the orchestra&apos;s Barbican residency. And it was, without doubt, one of the most beautiful things anyone had heard for a long time. It also raised questions, however, as to whether beauty is actually enough when it comes to Strauss&apos;s response to Nietzsche&apos;s magnum opus. Jansons paced it with great care, avoiding the common pitfall of overt flashiness. The playing was supreme and immaculately judged, both in colour and detail. But there were also lapses in tension. The quiet, irresolute ending famously pulls away from Nietzsche in tone, but the work&apos;s central sections are rooted in the\u00a0philosopher&apos;s immense struggle to\u00a0redefine man&apos;s place in a godless universe. Extraordinary though this was, it was sometimes short on effort, frenzy and emotional extremes. The great performances came after the interval.

The answer lies in that most basic commodity, manure. Since Whiteman took over the top job at theagency last year, there has been almost constant controversy about staffing levels for border checks and whether a risk-based approach is more effective, as Brodie Clark, former head of the Border Force, continues to maintain. Whiteman might benefit from studying how a specialist Dutch public sector team tackled its own enforcement problem: the problem of too much manure. Use of manure in the Netherlands&apos; intensive farming system is strictly regulated to avoid environmental damage. But until recently, many Dutch farmers were evading the law, which was costing the country millions in EU fines. One answer would have been to increase the number of inspectors on the ground. But that approach would have been too expensive and, more importantly, not efficient, according to Kees Kloet, who manages a team of specialist data analysts in the Dutch ministry of economic affairs. So rather than increasing the number of inspectors, Kloet increased the number of analysts in his team, who used specialist software to pick up patterns that would provide the environment inspectors with high quality information about farmers breaking the EU rules. By cross-checking data about things like transport, storage and feed against the number of animals officially reported, it was possible to pick up on likely infringements of the law. Initial results were, however, disappointing. &quot;There was some improvement, but it wasn&apos;t huge,&quot; acknowledged Kloet, speaking to public and private sector leaders at a recent conference in Amsterdam on the use of business intelligence software. What really made the difference to tracking down illegal use of manure was putting existing statistics together with geo-based systems. &quot;There&apos;s nothing as interesting as a map,&quot; explained Kloet. More accurate tracking of the movement of animals and manure proved a winning combination that was vital in helping the Netherlands avoid swingeing EU fines. &quot;The Netherlands get 1.1bn euros a year in EU subsidies. We&apos;re pretty good at keeping track, but it we get it wrong, we pay millions in fines,&quot; he said. Success in this area has led to Kloet being able to expand his team of analysts, from six to 16, and his advice is to start small and prove the value of information to the public sector, by mixing short-term results with strategic goals: &quot;Before you can invest [in expansion] \u2013 even if you&apos;re sure of a positive business case \u2013 you have to have many discussions,&quot; he pointed out. &quot;It&apos;s almost impossible to start something big from scratch.&quot; He also counselled caution on managing the expectations of potential users. &quot;I did some things wrong. I was too optimistic about the speed and quality of our products,&quot; he told delegates. &quot;People think you push two buttons and get the data.

This was, London mayor Boris Johnson proclaimed, the first time a naked flame had been permitted on a British Airways flight since smoking was banned on planes. And there it sat, lit by the rays of the sun at ancient Olympia a week earlier but now occupying two seats in the front row of the passenger cabin of a gold-painted Airbus A319. It was contained in four specially made golden lanterns, each 15 inches high, during the four-hour flight from Athens&apos;s Eleftherios Venizelos airport\u201a itself built for the 2004 Olympics\u201a to the Royal Navy&apos;s airbase at Culdrose, near Penzance. The arrival of flight BA2012 in Cornwall preceded the start of the 70-day torch relay around Britain, which will end on 27 July when the flame is used to ignite the cauldron in the Olympic Stadium in London. Its in-flight attendants included footballer David Beckham, Olympics organiser Lord Coe, Hugh Robertson, the Olympics minister, Johnson and the occupant of the seat nearest to the flame: Princess Anne, president of the British Olympic Association. On landing it was met by Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, before being used by Beckham to light a ceremonial cauldron, from which a torch would be lit and placed in the hands of Ben Ainslie, the triple gold-medal winning sailor who was chosen to be the first of 8,000 torchbearers. Beckham, a member of the 2012 team since its inception, joined Coe on a visit to an Athenian primary school on Friday morning and made it clear that he would relish being a torchbearer during the London leg of the relay as well as a\u00a0member of Great Britain&apos;s Olympic football team. &quot;I&apos;ve never performed at an Olympic Games,&quot; he said. &quot;But to be part of this is something very special. We&apos;ve got some very special people carrying the torch, and it&apos;s going to be a proud moment for them. If I was to be one of those carrying in London, it would be very special for me.&quot; Cynics like to remind us that the torch relay was invented for &quot;Hitler&apos;s Games&quot; in 1936, but torch relays played a part in the ancient Olympics, sent out through Greek towns and villages to advertise the Games. And in the modern era, the Olympic flame was re-introduced in 1928 by the peace-loving people of Amsterdam, eight years before the Berlin organisers dreamed up the idea of reconnecting Aryan supremacists with their supposed ancestors. No one had thought to turn a flame into an Olympic symbol when London first held the Games at White City in 1908. On the second occasion, 40 years later, the torch arrived at Wembley stadium by a circuitous route, taken to avoid a threat of disturbances in northern Greece, still enduring the aftermath of its civil war. Its overland journey was undertaken in a car provided by Rolls-Royce and specially geared to proceed at a stately 8mph. Making its way from Italy via the Simplon Pass to Lausanne, where it paused to pay tribute at the grave of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, the flame went through Luxembourg, Belgium \u2013 halting at the tomb of the unknown soldier in Brussels \u2013 and France, where it was transferred to the destroyer HMS Bicester, arriving in Dover nine days after leaving Olympia to a welcome from a crowd of 50,000. The moment it landed on British soil, before it could be handed to the Lord Lieutenant of Kent, the flame went out. Officially, it was relit from a spare carried from Greece. Unofficially, a cigarette lighter was hastily employed. Eventually it was carried into the stadium by John Mack, the 22-year-old president of the Cambridge University athletic club, as fine a specimen of blond, strapping manhood as could be found. This time the designated hero figure may be Johnson but is more likely to be Steve Redgrave, the owner of gold medals from five successive Games, or perhaps an East End child of symbolic mixed ethnicity. According to Coe, discussions on the identities of the final torchbearers have yet to begin, but Beckham is unlikely to be disappointed, just as he will almost certainly be granted his wish of a place in the football squad.

Eight years after Sebastian Coe and his team set out to win the Games for London, the Olympic flame had touched down in Britain. Now the Games can begin. This was, London mayor Boris Johnson proclaimed, the first time a naked flame had been permitted on a British Airways flight since they banned smoking on planes. And there indeed it sat, lit a week earlier by the rays of the sun at ancient Olympia but now, in quadruplicate, occupying two seats in the front row of the passenger cabin of BA2012. It flickered bravely in four specially made lanterns, each 15in high, during the four-hour trip from Athens&apos; Eleftherios Venizelios airport \u201abuilt for the 2004 Olympics, to the Royal Navy&apos;s airbase at Culdrose, near Penzance. The arrival in Cornwall preceded the start of the 70-day, torch relay around Britain, which will end on July 27, when the flame is used to ignite the cauldron in London&apos;s Olympic Stadium. Its in-flight attendants, alongside Johnson, included footballer David Beckham, Olympics organiser Lord Coe, the Olympics minister Hugh Robertson, Princess Anne, the president of the British Olympic Association, and a small posse of track-suited Metropolitan police officers. On landing at Culdrose, where the flight was met by Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minster, the flame was transferred to a ceremonial cauldron from which a torch will be lit early on Saturday morning and placed in the hands of Ben Ainslie, the triple gold medal winning sailor, the first of 8,000 runners. The second is Anastasia Swallow, an 18-year-old surfer from St Ives. &quot;So many of the people who are running will be members of the communities through which they&apos;re carrying the torch,&quot; Coe said. &quot;Our market research says that at least nine million people will be watching, and many of them will be seeing their local coach, or teacher, or policeman.&quot; Or perhaps their local A-list celebrity. Beckham, a member of the 2012 team since its inception, made it clear that he would relish being a torch-bearer during the leg of the relay that passes through his native east London as well as being selected for Great Britain&apos;s Olympic football team. &quot;I&apos;ve never performed at an Olympic Games,&quot; he said. &quot;But to be part of this is something very special. We&apos;ve got some very special people carrying the torch and it&apos;s going to be a proud moment for them. If I was to be one of those carrying in London, it would be very special for me.&quot; Cynics like to point out that the torch relay was invented for &quot;Hitler&apos;s Games&quot; in 1936, but torch relays played a part in the Ancient Olympics, sent out through Greek towns and villages to advertise the Games. In the modern era, the Olympic flame was re-introduced in 1928 by the peace-loving people of Amsterdam, eight years before the Berlin organisers dreamed up the idea of reconnecting Aryan supremacists with their supposed ancestors. No one had thought to turn a flame into an Olympic symbol when London first held the Games at White City in 1908. On the second occasion, 40 years later, the torch arrived at Wembley stadium by a circuitous route in order to avoid a threat of disturbances in northern Greece, still enduring the aftermath of its civil war. Its overland journey through Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium and France was undertaken in a car provided by Rolls-Royce and specially geared to proceed at a stately 8mph. The destroyer HMS Bicester carried it from Calais to Dover, where it was welcomed by a crowd of 50,000. Then it promptly went out. Officially, it was relit from a spare carried from Greece. Unofficially, a cigarette lighter was hastily employed. Eventually it was carried into the stadium by John Mack, the 22-year-old president of the Cambridge University Athletic Club, as fine a specimen of blond, strapping manhood that could be found. This time the designated hero figure might be Johnson but is more likely to be Steve Redgrave, the owner of gold medals from five successive Games, or perhaps an east End child of symbolic mixed ethnicity. According to Coe, discussions on the identities of the final torch-bearers have yet to begin, but Beckham is unlikely to be disappointed, just as he will almost certainly be granted his wish of a place in the football squad. He was mobbed by expats and Greek guests during a reception at the British ambassador&apos;s residence in Athens on Thursday night, but those suggesting that his selection for the team might be a ploy to use his celebrity to fill seats and sell shirts were being &quot;a little bit disrespectful&quot;, the 37-year-old former England captain said. &quot;Managers like Sir Alex Ferguson, Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson, they don&apos;t pick you because they want to fill stadiums.

At 11 in the morning, I&apos;m standing outside the designated cafe \u2013 which is closed \u2013 among the inevitable joggers and retired couples on their constitutional and toddlers feeding the swans, when Hegarty comes striding along the boardwalk. He is well over 6ft tall, his bulky frame dressed in indeterminate numbers of layers of black, his moon-pale face and soft features and smile partly covered by strands of long, straight black hair. As a younger man he used to walk the streets of New York wearing a sheer silk slip and military boots with the words &quot;fuck off&quot; inked on his forehead. He&apos;s lost the stare-rejecting attire, if not quite all of the sentiment. In search of coffee we head to the nearby Rose theatre foyer, which is full of latte-loving young mothers encouraging their offspring to let off some steam. When he was invited to edit the Guardian&apos;s music website a couple of years ago, Hegarty suggested that what humanity urgently needed in order to survive was &quot;a seismic shift toward the feminine in our empathetic systems of perceiving and interacting with the world&quot;. When he was making this claim I&apos;m not sure that what he had in mind was the fecund yummy mummies of the royal borough of Kingston, but it seems appropriate anyhow, in the hour or so that follows, that his thoughts on the future feminisation of the planet should occasionally be threatened to be overwhelmed by women talking over voluble babies. While he is in London, Hegarty is finalising some of his plans for the forthcoming Meltdown festival, which he is curating, down river at the Southbank Centre. He has been dividing his time of late between his home in New York and a base in Madrid (where he has been working on a theatre project with the cultish performance artist Marina Abramovic), but southern England, where he lived until the age of 10, remains a formative grid reference. Though he has been an important figure in the New York avant garde for 20 years, Hegarty grew up in Chichester, west Sussex. He is 41 now, but he is so curiously boyish in manner that you can well imagine him still as the awkward British chorister, developing a bit faster, and a bit more unconventionally than his fellow descants; he still looks both at home and not at home in these suburbs, a big man who has got used to projecting his inner hermaphrodite quite comfortably. Hegarty&apos;s spoken voice, a warm conspiratorial whisper, only occasionally hints at the uniquely powerful and vulnerable sound that he is capable of making on stage and in recordings. When the range of that soul-charged tenor first fully unfolded with his band Antony and the Johnsons in 2005, you had the sense of it coming out of nowhere, emerging, as the title of his breakthrough Mercury prize-winning album I Am a Bird Now suggested, as if from another, more aery, species entirely.            Hegarty himself doesn&apos;t quite see it that way. The creation of his androgynous persona, and the discovery of the possibilities of his voice, was a mix-and-match of influence and experiment conducted over many years. Meltdown works best when the curator approaches it as a kind of musical autobiography, and certainly that is Hegarty&apos;s intention this year. His first forays into art were collages and cut-ups of magazines, which he still makes and exhibits from time to time, cultural references spliced together to form vivid and unsettling wholes. He takes the approach into other areas of his life, too, he suggests. &quot;I like arranging all my friends as constellations, and I do love the process of curation, so this is perfect for me.&quot; To prove the point he sets his smartphone on his knee and starts scrolling excitedly through the acts he has lined up. First up in an eclectic list \u2013 &quot;mainly ecstatic female voices with a few queens thrown in&quot; \u2013 is Marc Almond, whom Hegarty has persuaded to appear in his Marc and the Mambas incarnation, the side project of his Soft Cell years. Almond has become a friend, but in his teens Hegarty was the obsessive fan. &quot;Marc pretty much singlehandedly determined my future as a musician and the style of music I would pursue,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I was about 13 when I heard him. I was living in America, a suburb in California and getting those records by land mail was really hard work. You would hear rumours about records in magazines which themselves were pretty hard to get hold of. But for all those reasons Marc and the Mambas were really important to me. I lived on the top of a hill in the middle of nowhere. And those records arriving through the door were really my lifeline.&quot; Hegarty moved out to California in 1981. The family were following his father&apos;s work as an engineer; they had gone first to Amsterdam, before ending up on the west coast of the US. Hegarty is not keen on public psychoanalysis and pretty wary of sharing even the facts of his life, preferring mystery, but he hints that the abrupt shift across the Atlantic was not an especially happy one for him. In Chichester he had enjoyed singing with the choir but that opportunity was not available to him at school in the US, where singing was considered &quot;effeminate&quot; and &quot;shameful&quot; among the boys. As he reached puberty and his ambiguous gender identity became more defined, he suggests he wasn&apos;t bullied so much as left to his own devices. His reaction was, he has said elsewhere, to confront his identity head on: &apos;I started wearing more makeup. That&apos;s the honest truth. I started probably about 12\u2026 13.&quot; As he applied his eyeliner, Marc Almond made him feel as though he was not alone. Previously his only musical crush, inevitably, had been on Kate Bush. But he looked on Almond as something like a cross between a role model and a guardian angel. &quot;I always felt he had kind of left a trail of breadcrumbs for me, to follow him into music,&quot; he says. &quot;You know I would collect quotes and references that he mentioned in interviews, pore over them. He laid out the land for me. And I really learned to sing listening to him singing. Him and Nina Simone. As Nina would say in the studio, &apos;Don&apos;t put nothing in unless you really feel it. Let&apos;s do it again from the top please.&apos;&quot; Hegarty likes his singers to embody different kinds of courage, &quot;people who deliver a vision of the world they totally believe in&quot;. In his live performances he is a master of that kind of conviction: his most recent show, at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a staging of his latest album Swanlights, saw him bathed in the green glow of lasers, accompanied by a 60-piece orchestra while keening rapturously about a vision of &quot;being dead, underwater and filled with crystals of light&quot;. It was described in the New York Times as an evening of &quot;wonderment&quot; with &quot;cries from the heart, crashing like waves&quot;. Hegarty has always been drawn to voices that self-consciously channel female mythic power. His South Bank lineup will include not only the return to a mainstream stage of the ethereal Scots vocals of Liz Fraser, once of the Cocteau Twins, but also the &quot;Edith Piaf of Turkey&quot;, Selda Ba\u02d8gcan, who took up the people&apos;s cause against the generals of Istanbul armed only with a guitar, and Buffy Sainte Marie, who invigorated electronic and folk music with Native American wisdom in the 1960s and 70s. Hegarty&apos;s father used to play tapes of Sainte-Marie in his car, and those songs retain an eerie nostalgia for Hegarty himself. &quot;Little Wheel Spin and Spin was so haunting and so frightening to me as a child,&quot; he says. &quot;Buffy was very clear about what she saw as the crisis and very keen to spit it out, almost like a witch. I like singing that is not far short of a hex. Nina Simone did the same thing around race and the civil rights movement. All of that taught me how you can participate in culture as an artist.&quot; In his own engagement with that &quot;crisis&quot;, he defines it as &quot;a crisis of spiritual issues, but also a practical crisis of ecology&quot;. Hegarty is an avid reader of the Guardian&apos;s environment pages and our conversation is salted with quotes from articles he has recently clipped. (&quot;They said last month in the US it was 8.7 degrees hotter than it should have been\u2026 Every taxi driver knows something weird is happening with the weather. And everyone is waiting in vain for the institutions that are supposed to have our best interests at heart to come up with some solution\u2026&quot;) Some of the lyrics on his last two albums suggest a kind of transcendent Wordsworthian relationship with the natural world. I wonder if this was established in Hegarty as a child. &quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;I think it was but in just in a very typical south of England way. I was raised walking around on the South Downs at weekends on my father&apos;s shoulders. And with a sense that nature was for ever. The critical shift that has happened in our lifetimes is the idea that we are actually undermining that whole belief. Can you imagine the burden on the psyche of our species that has involved? How can we possibly process that without massive global summits on what we should be doing? Instead we are being divided and conquered by this terrorism scaremongering and half the world, including most of America, is tied up in patriarchal religions that believes apocalypse is the climax of what we are waiting for.&quot; Once he is into his stride on this theme, there is no stopping him. Hegarty was an ardent Christopher Hitchens fan, slayer of &quot;sky god religions that destroy our connection with the natural world and promote the idea that paradise lies elsewhere&quot;. As a transgender person \u2013 and he has no wish to define the &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; of his sexuality any more precisely \u2013 he sees himself as having a small headstart on most of the rest of civilisation in his intimate understanding of the need for feminine power structures to restore imbalances created by &quot;patriarchal religion, patriarchal economies and patriachal government&quot;. In this way he has moved from the deeply personal emotional conflicts and epiphanies of his earlier songs to what he sees as a more political message. In this vision the drag queens and trannies that he came of age among in New York are not only defiantly transgressive but also prophetic. &quot;There was another article I was reading in the Guardian,&quot; he says, with a grin, &quot;about a year ago that declared there was no fundamental difference between men and women. I mean, are you off your rocker? The whole problem is this difference between men and women and our lack of self-knowledge about it. Our bodies are like computers with two different operating systems. One is called testosterone, one is called oestrogen. The same body, different software. And within the transgender community you see this very clearly. You watch people take oestrogen or testosterone and you see them change not just physically, but their whole way of thinking, their whole approach.&quot; Has he ever experimented with that process himself? &quot;No, but I have seen it very intimately, and the changes are not subtle, they are fundamental\u2026&quot; Hegarty has perhaps always been aware that he has the capacity to shift between these two operating systems, to try them both on for size and communicate in his highly allusive way how it feels. &quot;The future,&quot; he declares in his stagey whisper, &quot;is bringing more understanding of how we make the decisions we make on a biological level, and then to step back from that and see what is going on. We need more oestrogen-based thinking, basically.&quot; If Marc Almond helped him to understand this calling, it was watching the film Mondo New York, about the lives of Manhattan performance artists, when he was 17, that allowed Hegarty to see where he had to go to be himself. One star of that film, Joey Arias, &quot;is my New York hero really,&quot; he says. &quot;In the film I saw this queen dressed as Billie Holiday, singing in the voice of Billie Holiday A Hard Day&apos;s Night by the Beatles. It was like seeing a black swan made out of razor blades or something. So elusive, so threatening, so androgynous, so sexual. I was still living in California, but I knew I had to go and see Joey.&quot; Not long after he arrived in Arias&apos;s New York, Hegarty formed the Blacklips Performance Cult, a drag theatre troupe with whom he put on weekly shows at Mother, a club in the Meatpacking District frequented by drag punks and &quot;gender mutants&quot;. The Blacklips performed a surreal burlesque during which Hegarty rehearsed his spellbinding laments, in a show that also occasionally involved throwing offal and buckets of blood at the audience. The Johnsons (the name a tribute to Marsha P Johnson, a transgender activist and leader in the Stonewall Riots, whose body was discovered in the Hudson river after a gay pride march in 1992) followed on from the Blacklips. The band was always a shifting group of collaborators for Hegarty&apos;s voice, and though the first Antony and the Johnsons album was released in 1998, it was not until 2003, when an EP called I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy (the cover of which shows Hegarty lying in supplication before a naked Japanese hermaphrodite) caught the attention of Hal Willner, the music director for Saturday Night Live, that he received any wider attention. Willner passed the record on to Lou Reed, who insisted: &quot;When I heard Antony, I knew that I was in the presence of an angel.&quot; Reed invited Hegarty to join him as a backup vocalist on his Animal Serenade tour, and the pair have been friends and occasional collaborators ever since (Hegarty is hoping that Reed and his partner Laurie Anderson, of O Superman fame, will both return the compliment and appear at Meltdown). If for any reason they don&apos;t make it, there will be no shortage of friends from Hegarty&apos;s meat-chucking Blacklips days. He has, he says, of late helped to form a sort of political group called the Future Feminist Foundation, which has meetings in New York from time to time. They have been working on a manifesto, but it&apos;s not the most organised of groups, so they haven&apos;t quite drafted all of it yet. The basics are pretty clear though. &quot;It&apos;s not a group that thinks women should just crawl towards economic equality in the way we have been engaged in since the 60s,&quot; Hegarty says. &quot;That can&apos;t be the climax of feminism. It&apos;s like gay rights, as if gay marriage is the end point, as if we just want to be included in these business-as-usual institutions. That&apos;s not the point of being queer, just as mitigated reproductive rights aren&apos;t the point of being a woman. We want to move this forward. Do something great\u2026 overturn all these failed male structures of thinking, all this aggression in decision-making\u2026&quot; he pauses in his impromptu stump speech to the mother&apos;s union of Kingston upon Thames to laugh a little. &quot;Sorry if I sound nuts,&quot; he says. The unofficial leader of the Future Feminist Foundation, or at least the woman that Hegarty &quot;would follow anywhere&quot;, is Kembra Pfahler. She fronts a glam-punk band called the Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black. &quot;Kembra,&quot; Hegarty says, with a certain amount of jealous awe, is &quot;the most hardcore future feminist really.&quot; How so? &quot;Well, for example she does this one performance piece called Wall of Vagina, which is like seven girls spray-painted different colours and naked and they just pile up on top of each other and open their legs wide and create this wall on stage or in a gallery, this wall of vaginas, and you may not pass through the wall.&quot; That does sound quite a hard act to follow, I say. Pfahler will be coming to London to perform for Meltdown, though regrettably not with her painted fellow travellers. &quot;I&apos;ve asked her to do a lecture, and then she will do a concert accompanied by Vaginal Creme Davis, the quintessential LA Afro-American drag punk\u2026&quot; Of course. You get half a sense that Hegarty sees Meltdown as a delicious opportunity to close the circle of his life, to bring his New York extremes back home to the norms of his childhood in a spirit of mischief as well as political commitment. He has learned a lot, he says, from Marina Abramovic, the self-harming godmother of performance art, about the possibilities of theatre. He has asked Abramovic to do a lecture that will only be open to women, part of his current project of finding ways to have men &quot;understand the sacred humility of recognising a woman&apos;s space&quot;. This is the first step in what he sees as the necessary transfer of power between the sexes in order to save the species. &quot;Many men,&quot; he believes, with wild optimism, &quot;will be hugely relieved by that shift.&quot; There is not a vast amount of evidence for that assertion at the moment, I suggest. Where does he look for hope? &quot;Well,&quot; he says with a laugh, &quot;they are letting us do this festival. It&apos;s a start!&quot; With that battle cry he heads out into the streets of Kingston, a man with a mission, which in the short term involves buying a loaf of bread to go and feed the swans. Antony&apos;s Meltdown, 1-12 August, is part of the Southbank Centre&apos;s Festival of the World with MasterCard; www.southbankcentre.co.uk/meltdown. The Observer is media partner MUSICAL HEROES: Antony on some of his Meltdown highlights MARC ALMOND      &quot;The work that Marc did was totally off the mark. It was so ambitious. He is very well loved, and he is interesting, because he did it the wrong way round as it were. He went from mainstream pop into subculture. Usually things go the other way.&quot; 9\u00a0August LIZ FRASER &quot;In my later teens I became intensely preoccupied with the work of Liz Fraser and the Cocteau Twins. Liz is the secret jewel of Britain. I would cry to those songs a lot, more than sing them. There is something so maternal in her voice. It&apos;s not just a melodic but a phonetic approach to singing which is totally intuitive, and which she invented herself. I get chills just thinking about it. She hasn&apos;t performed for a long time, so for her to sing is a centrepiece of the festival.&quot; 6 and 7\u00a0August DIAMANDA GAL\u00c1S      &quot;Diamanda is the other great singer in the group. Just her ferocity as a singer \u2013 no one does what she does. She is the Maria Callas of art music. Again that ecstatic range and extraordinary courage.&quot; 1\u00a0August SELDA BA\u011eCAN      &quot;Selda is like the Edith Piaf of Turkey, a tremendous political voice, a folk musician in the broadest sense. She has this tone in her voice that makes me cry my eyes out even though I don&apos;t understand the language, or really the tradition. I&apos;ve probably listened to her more than anyone in the last two years.&quot; 2\u00a0August  LAURIE ANDERSON      &quot;My mother listened to Laurie Anderson; one of the records we brought with us from WH Smith out to America was O Superman. My mum was a photographer \u2013 and Laurie is someone who names what she sees in bold language. She is also one of very few artists who will write about the future, which surprisingly few musicians do.&quot; 3\u00a0August COCOROSIE      &quot;CocoRosie are a very inspired band of young women from New York, part of our Future Feminist Foundation group. They honestly don&apos;t give a shit what anybody thinks about them. They taught me so much about magical space. And it is amazing to be taught by people who are younger than you.&quot; 4\u00a0August  BUFFY SAINTE-MARIE      &quot;Buffy is on another frontier, for the way that she merged folk music and indigenous music with new technologies. She was using electronic instruments in the early 70s. She had a certain moral authority on the basis of her indigenous identity. A real spiritual clarity.&quot; 7\u00a0August KEMBRA PFALER  &quot;Kembra, from the Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black, is one of the most important artists in New York. She is a true pioneer of avant-garde urban theatre. She just creates these art movements, availabilism, which is all about working with what you have. She is going do a lecture, and then she will do a concert accompanied by Vaginal Creme Davis, the quintessential LA afro American drag punk.&quot; 10\u00a0August  JOEY ARIAS       &quot;Joey is going to come and do his Strange Fruit. A whole night as Billie Holliday. It&apos;s the highest art punk has to offer. What Joey does is not female impersonation, it&apos;s as if he channels Billie. It&apos;s punk really in the way that Leigh Bowery was punk.&quot; 8\u00a0August MARINA ABRAMOVIC &quot;Marina recently did this huge piece at Moma, New York where she sat in the gallery for 700 hours and people queued up to sit one to one and look at her. I have asked her to do a lecture only for women. She said she would never have suggested that of her own volition but she has agreed to do it. I think it is very important, very golden that men understand the sacred humility of recognising a woman&apos;s space.&quot; 5\u00a0August Please note that Antony has responded to this article in the comments thread below.", "sentences": ["The family were following his father&apos;s work as an engineer; they had gone first to Amsterdam, before ending up on the west coast of the US."], "title": "Antony Hegarty: 'We need more oestrogen-based thinking'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/20/antony-hegarty-interview-meltdown-gender", "tags": ["Meltdown festival", "Antony and the Johnsons", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Festivals", "Culture", "Sexuality", "Society", "Gender", "World news", "Music festivals", "Southbank Centre"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-19T23:06:14Z", "article": "The Van Baerle Trio met by chance as students in Amsterdam.

De Boer was on Liverpool&apos;s radar after securing back-to-back Eredivisie titles with Ajax, where he has also earned praise for the fluid attacking play he has adopted since taking over from Martin Jol in 2010.

The community only had 11 members and the Iron Curtain was still present. Humble beginnings aside, 25 years on, the programme continues to have a great impact on the development of Europe and its higher education. In 1987, 3,244 students spent part of their studies in another member country. Three million students have followed their example in the past 25 years and the number of countries has grown from 11 to 33, including non-EU members such as Croatia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Turkey and Switzerland. The budget of the programme for the period 2007-2013 is \u20ac3.1bn. More than in numbers of mobile students, the impact of the programme has been on the internationalisation and the reform of higher education. Erasmus has paved the way for the reform of European higher education under the Bologna Process, has been a pilot for its study point scheme ECTS, and was an initiator for the opening up to countries in central and eastern Europe to EU-membership, as it is for current aspiring candidate members. The programme stimulated both national governments and institutions of higher education to develop European and international strategies. The proposal by the European Commission for a new &quot;Erasmus for all&quot; programme reflects this global approach to Erasmus and the ambition of the commission to extend the scope and targets of the programme: an additional five million students studying abroad between 2014 and 2020. Even in the UK \u2013 which has always been a small player in the programme due to the imbalance between continental students interested in studying in the UK and the limited mobility aspirations of British students (twice as many Erasmus students study in the UK than go from the UK to the continent to study) and the priority of recruitment of students as an income source - the interest for the programme is growing. On 22 March 2012, the House of Lords European Union Committee released a publication on The Modernisation of Higher Education in Europe. The report expresses concern on the low levels of UK student outward mobility, and proposes that universities and the commission should promote mobility opportunities and make Erasmus placements more flexible. While the Bologna ministers of education in their recent biannual meeting in Bucharest kept firm to their aspiration to have 20% mobility, the figures though are showing a different picture. In most countries the number of mobile students is still below 5%. There is an increased concern about the focus on numbers and percentages, which moves away from the need to concentrate on the content and the quality of the international experience. Student mobility \u2013 and internationalisation of higher education as such \u2013 is not a goal in itself but a means to enhance the quality of the educational experience and the international learning outcomes of the students. In the early years of the Erasmus programme, the enthusiasm of faculty \u2013 encountering their colleagues, learning about their curricula and teaching methods \u2013 was driving the success and the impact of the Erasmus programme. Erasmus has moved away from those inspiring days and has become too much a bureaucratic exercise, in which only numbers count. If the Erasmus programme would find something back of its focus on curriculum and learning outcomes of the past, not only it will enhance the quality of the experience but also will increase the interest of the faculty and the students, and as a result of that the numbers.

There&apos;s always a little voice in your head providing a running commentary. Some critics, recording this invisible guide&apos;s comments as they go, scribble their way through exhibitions. It is a surprise they see anything at all. I try to ignore my invisible little friend, the smart-assed creep on my shoulder. But if that doesn&apos;t work, there&apos;s always exorcism. We were standing at a voodoo altar, curator Jean de Loisy, anthropologist Bertrand Hell and me. There were just a couple of pots on the floor, each containing a huge, multicoloured, waxy, fat-congealed mound of stuff. There might have been some chicken in there, and what looked like jawbones, of what I couldn&apos;t tell. It had been sitting under the gallery lights for a couple of weeks. Yum. &quot;What this thing needs to activate it is strong alcohol!&quot; De Loisy exclaimed, and picked up a bottle of gin from beside the pots, giving the mounds a liberal sprinkling then taking a swig himself. These are the sorts of spirits I like, but he didn&apos;t pass the bottle. For a moment, nothing discernible happened. No voodoo, no who-do. The sorcerer from Togo who concocted the altar goes by the name of Az\u00e9 Kokovivina, Sorcerer of the Giggles. Maybe that&apos;s where the gin comes in. Suddenly I wasn&apos;t laughing, but plunged into a world of spirits, demons and creatures from the netherworld. Annette Messager&apos;s clothes flew about the room, powered by electric fans. A tiny carved Peruvian shaman, part baby, part boxer, and no bigger than my hand, took up a fighting stance. A medieval St Michael slew a demon, Joseph Beuys gave a lecture to a dead hare and Picasso transformed himself into a faun. A figure with a head like a dunce&apos;s cap gave me the eye, and what looked like a sock turned into a cuttlefish. Ancient beings of remarkable ferocity stalked my way and Sri Lankan masks gurned and yowled.     Spirits and demons ... Motion/Emotion (2012), by Annette Messager, at Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012. Photograph: Andre Morin    In the Garden of Addiction, Christophe Berdaguer and Marie P\u00e9jus&apos;s tangle of glass tubes, like so many evil flowers, proffered the scents of opium, cocaine, skunk and booze. Various modern-day witches and healers discussed their craft on a tower of TV screens. It was like watching a dozen cookery channels at once. Cultures, eons, continents flew by. We were among the forces of chaos and disorder: healers and tricksters, shape-shifters and spirit guides, transgressors and transvestites. Housed in a mock-up cave of aluminium struts, wallboard and plaster-soaked scrim, the exhibition Les Ma\u00eetres du D\u00e9sordre (Masters of Chaos) is an exercise in wild curating at the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly in Paris. De Loisy has always been a bit of a maverick curator. Here, he has brought together a bewildering selection of artefacts, sculptures, costumes, masks and objects from past and present, and from every continent. Beautiful, tender objects collide with the monstrous and the devilish. Much of it has extraordinary power and vitality. Among it all are a number of more modern, western artworks \u2013 from Picasso to Paul McCarthy \u2013 as if to show the persistence of the transgressive and the search for hidden meaning in the world. Beuys, a latter-day shaman, thought he could heal the postwar world with his art. Randy old goat Picasso was a shape-shifter and trickster. Other recent artists \u2013 Jonathan Meese, the Chapman Brothers, Russia&apos;s Oleg Kulik being led around on a chain and behaving like a mad dog \u2013 are just tricky. But if you want to be an artist, you&apos;ve got to believe in something. The trouble with most contemporary art in this context is that little of it, if any, is the product of a shared belief system that glues the world, and the self, together. If there are no rules, there&apos;s nothing to transgress. The exhibition&apos;s title is taken from Bertrand Hell&apos;s book Possession and Shamanism, yet to be translated into English. Masters of Chaos is also the culmination of De Loisy&apos;s own 20-year obsession with the subject. His previous curatorial projects have included exhibitions on beauty, on the face, and, in 2008, Traces of the Sacred, a tour of the persistence of the sacred in 20th- and 21st-century art. He also collaborated with Anish Kapoor and James Turrell and, after working at the Centre Pompidou, went sailing around the world for a number of years. He is a man in search of something. He has also recently been appointed director of the newly renovated Palais de Tokyo, just across the Seine, where the Paris Triennale is currently on view \u2013 the launch show in the expanded, renovated building.     Wild ... Jean-Michel Basquiat (1988) at Les Ma\u00eetres du D\u00e9sordre (Masters of Chaos). Photograph: The estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat/ADAGP    The two exhibitions share an interest in the ethnographic, in cultural difference and transcultural proximity, but could not be more different in approach. De Loisy is passionate about objects. The Triennale, which goes by the title Intense Proximity, is much more cautious about the readings we might make of the vast corpus of paintings and sculpture, films and video installations, photographs and drawings brought together by guest curator Okwui Enwezor. De Loisy&apos;s show is a thematic romp. Enwezor&apos;s triennale admits to the difficulties of finding order and meaning in the world. The triennale is a trial for any spectator. I wandered like a lost tourist. One minute, you&apos;re in the Venezuelan jungle, the next at a mixed-race wedding in the new South Africa. One minute, I&apos;m staring at the most intimate body parts of an Amsterdam sex-worker, the next watching a TV documentary about a talent contest for migrant Filipinos in Tel Aviv. I twirl along to north African beats and stare at a group of closed and silent grand pianos. Here are Claude Levi-Strauss&apos;s notebook drawings and a great new painting by Chris Ofili; over there are some gorgeous black-and-white photographs of Bahia&apos;s Afro-Brazilian dock life in the 1940s. On a screen, blacked-up (now that really does seem transgressive), the young French artist Lili Reynaud-Dewar dances among a group of her own sculptures, in homage to Josephine Baker. The day before my shimmy with the shamans, I&apos;d spent almost five hours here and was still reeling. Enwezor, who directed Documenta 11 in 2002 and is now running the Haus der Kunst in Munich, has a very different take on art and ethnography to De Loisy. He sees a link between the ethnographer and the artist, ethnography and curating.     La Chor\u00e9graphie des Tr\u00e9sors de Guerre (2011) and La Frise Tr\u00e9sors de Guerre (1976-2012), by Sarkis, at Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012. Photograph: Andre Morin    Intense Proximity focuses on this: the link between the close and the distant, the near and the far. It confronts us with the world&apos;s disjunctions. With so many cultural differences and competing interests in an ever-shrinking world, how do we even begin to make sense of it all? Is art a kind of news from elsewhere (whether a geographical place or a somewhere in the artist&apos;s mind), or a report from the close-to-home? Both exhibition catalogues quote the ironic opening phrase of Levi-Strauss&apos;s marvellous 1955 book Tristes Tropiques: &quot;I hate travelling and explorers&quot;. The idea of exploration has changed immeasurably since the days of 19th-century colonial empire, and as much again since Levi-Strauss&apos;s first trip to Brazil in 1935. Bertrand Hell told me how little travelling French ethnographers and anthropologists undertake nowadays. On the other hand, today&apos;s curators, and even critics, are always on the move. Enwezor admits to a kind of intellectual vertigo and spatial disorientation. Descending into the bowels of the Palais de Tokyo, I knew what he meant. It has hidden depths, basements leading to sub-basements, subterranean mezzanines and floors, traversed by ramps and open, curving staircases. Films are screened in rediscovered auditoria that had been walled up for decades, and in side rooms branching from dizzying Piranesian shafts. The place seems to go on for ever, and so does the triennale. When I described my journey through the triennale to De Loisy, he said he likes the idea of people getting lost in these basements. I like being lost, too. But this journey is accompanied by growing panic.     'How can anyone deal with all this stuff?' ... La Porte: Derri\u00e8re la Porte...! Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019il y a Derri\u00e8re la Porte..?, by Georges Ad\u00e9agbo (2012), at Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012. Photograph: Andre Morin    I&apos;m bought up short by a sign that reads: &quot;I am not exotic I am exhausted.&quot; How can anyone deal with all this stuff? The urge to see everything leads to the frustration of not seeing anything, of always being driven on to the next thing without absorbing the last. It is a flight that becomes ever more urgent, ever more futile. If it is an encounter with anything, it is with competing urges: the voice on the shoulder jockeying me on, and a desire for it all to stop. It is an encounter with the chaos of the world. \u2022 Masters of Chaos is at the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly, Paris, until 29 July \u2022 Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012 is at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris, until 26 August", "sentences": ["One minute, I&apos;m staring at the most intimate body parts of an Amsterdam sex-worker, the next watching a TV documentary about a talent contest for migrant Filipinos in Tel Aviv."], "title": "Adrian Searle encounters \u2026 chaos in Paris", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/21/adrian-searle-encounters-chaos-paris", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Installation", "Exhibitions", "Paris holidays", "Travel", "Painting", "Sculpture", "Video art", "Photography"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-21T21:38:00Z", "article": "Liverpool will persist with an extensive interview process in the search for a new manager despite Frank de Boer becoming the third candidate publicly to reject the job since Kenny Dalglish was sacked last week.

Didier Deschamps, who was approached under a previous regime in 2010 and has been linked again, has said he expects to remain in charge at Marseille next season. Liverpool are undeterred by the rejections \u2013 indeed it was expected that some would follow the decision to approach several candidates before finalising a shortlist \u2013 and they will continue to hold talks this week. Roberto Mart\u00ednez of Wigan Athletic is on holiday but that will not prevent him meeting John W Henry and Tom Werner, Liverpool&apos;s principal owner and chairman, should an interview be scheduled for Boston later this week. Liverpool have denied that one interview with Mart\u00ednez has already taken place. There has been no approach to Fabio Capello despite the Italian being on the club&apos;s wishlist and open to the offer of a Premier League job.

I will leave on vacation but it is expected that I will be there [Marseille] for 2 July.&quot; Rafael Ben\u00edtez is keen on a return to Liverpool and enjoys the backing of many supporters but the Spaniard, who still lives on Merseyside, is not under consideration at this stage. Liverpool&apos;s owners were told another strong candidate was under the club&apos;s nose on Monday when Steve Nicol, the club&apos;s respected former defender, claimed David Moyes of Everton would make a fine choice. &quot;I would have no problem with David Moyes,&quot; said &quot;He&apos;s a fantastic manager. We talk about having the tools to do the job, and here&apos;s a guy who&apos;s had to work with blunt instruments, shall we say, and every year he keeps doing it. I would have no problem with him getting the job. &quot;You can&apos;t walk into Liverpool as an apprentice, so to speak.

But his father wanted the boy to follow him in becoming a blacksmith, or at least go into a trade where he would work with his hands. As a\u00a0compromise, his parents sent him at\u00a012 to a technical school to learn to\u00a0be\u00a0a painter and decorator, and in the evening he did a correspondence course in drawing. After a spell of house painting, Bogart joined a Rotterdam advertising agency in 1937 as a commercial artist, painting among other subjects portraits of the child star Shirley Temple, before quitting to launch his career in fine art in 1939. Despite the subterfuge needed to avoid forced labour for the German army during the second world war, he managed to produce a sequence of sombre and undeniably Dutch landscapes, solid, low-keyed and with low horizons. Soon after liberation in 1945, he made a dull portrait of himself with a brush in one hand and the regulation-issue oval palette for wannabe artists in the other. He filled the leftover space behind him with a wall, and it is the wall that holds the attention, with its real wall-like feeling, rough-textured, solid; this and the hands, the hands of a Van Gogh potato eater, of a workman, just what his father had wanted for him. This sense in his work of the tangible, a coming together of his first job painting houses and his implacably wall-like landscapes, lasted throughout Bogart&apos;s lifetime, through to the overwhelming presence of his celebrated late paintings, glowing blocks constructed, quite literally, out of great globs of pigment mixed with cement. Abstract, yes; expressionist, yes; but not abstract expressionist. He was not interested in gestural painting, brushed or poured from cans, not in his mature work anyway. His concern was building paintings. Bogart was born in Delft, where he spent the last year of the war in hiding. His father bestowed his own name, Abraham van den Boogaart, on his son. It was a 1950s Parisian gallery owner who suggested the switch to Bram Bogart. Liberation for Bogart had meant Paris, and he was one of a number of\u00a0hungry artists at the end of the war who saw arrival in France as a date with destiny. There, he began life anew by absorbing the discoveries of cubism in\u00a0organising pictorial space to dispel the leftover space of his early work.     Bram Bogart: Ommegang de Bruxelles (the historical pageant held in Brussels every summer, 1998, mixed media on board).  Photograph: Bernard Jacobson Gallery    Between 1946 and 1950 he shuttled between Paris and Le Cannet on the C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur, and then settled in Paris for almost a decade, painting often in monochrome like Jean Dubuffet, some of the canvases worked edge to edge with figures suggestive of the then recently discovered drawings of the Lascaux cavemen. In 1957 he showed for the first time in the UK, as part of an Arts Council touring exhibition, and held his own among a group that included Dubuffet, the Canadian abstract expressionist Jean-Paul Riopelle, the French tachiste Pierre Soulages, and Karel Appel, Bogart&apos;s compatriot and a member of\u00a0the Cobra group (Copenhagen, Brussels, Amsterdam). In 1958 Bogart had his first solo show in London, at the Gimpel Fils gallery, of canvases that were, the Times critic remarked, both sensuous and with the quality of rock faces. Bogart got on with Appel and his Cobra associates but fell out with the Dutch cultural establishment over what he perceived as its obsession with Cobra at the expense of any other style. It may not have been coincidence that in 1960 he moved to Belgium, first to Brussels, then for the rest of his life to Ohain, in\u00a0the province of Walloon Brabant. He\u00a0took Belgian citizenship in 1969. During these years, he laid on pigment and cement mixture so thickly that he had to arrange for metal stretchers to bear the weight of his work. Bogart&apos;s art entered collections all over Europe and he had shows at galleries including the Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, the Guggenheim in New York and the Louvre and Pompidou Centre in Paris. No public gallery in Britain picked up on him but there were several exhibitions in London over the years, culminating in two shows at Bernard Jacobson in Mayfair, in 2007 and 2009, showing late paintings of great beauty. The early drawing lessons paid off too. At the end of his life he was said to be still able, like Giotto, to draw a perfect circle, freehand. Bogart is survived by his wife, Leni, whom he married in 1958, and their children, Cornelia, Inge and Bram. \u2022 Bram Bogart (Abraham van den Boogaart), artist, born 12 July 1921; died 2 May 2012", "sentences": ["In 1957 he showed for the first time in the UK, as part of an Arts Council touring exhibition, and held his own among a group that included Dubuffet, the Canadian abstract expressionist Jean-Paul Riopelle, the French tachiste Pierre Soulages, and Karel Appel, Bogart&apos;s compatriot and a member of\u00a0the Cobra group (Copenhagen, Brussels, Amsterdam)."], "title": "Bram Bogart obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/23/bram-bogart", "tags": ["Art", "Painting", "Art and design", "Culture", "Belgium"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-24T13:11:00Z", "article": "Seven of Europe&apos;s leading media foundations have joined forces to launch the European Press Prize to reward excellence in journalism across all 47 countries of Europe. The seven include two British-based bodies - The Guardian Foundation and the Reuters Foundation. The foundations believe that saluting serious writing and reporting - in print or on newspaper websites - can help raise journalism&apos;s role as a defender of democracy&apos;s freedoms. Adriaan Stoop, the chairman of the board of the European Press Prize Foundation, says the seven groups jointly believe they have a responsibility for the quality of the public debate in Europe. He says:   &quot;By launching these awards we want to encourage high-quality, innovative and independent journalism.  Now that Europe is going through a crucial episode in its development affecting its citizens in many ways, we feel that this is essential to inspire a truly European discourse.&quot;  In the first year, awards will be given in four separate categories with prizes for each of \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,000).  The editing award will go to the editor adjudged to have contributed most to public debate and public understanding. The commentator award will go to the feature writer, columnist or commentator who has done most to illuminate vital issues for his readers. The news reporting award will go to the reporter, or specialist writer, whose work has made a decisive impact. The innovation award is for the outstanding innovation of the year - in print or on screen - that makes a significant contribution to journalism&apos;s future. Peter Preston, director of The Guardian Foundation and one of the founders of the European prize, says:   &quot;The genesis of these awards was almost spontaneous. All the involved foundations and trusts represent an abiding concern for the quality of journalism - and its role in safeguarding freedom. Here are awards that make that concern real.&quot;  The first awards will be made in January 2013. Entries open on 1 July and close on 26 October.  The panel of judges will be chaired by Harry Evans, editor-at-large of Thomson Reuters and the former editor of the Sunday Times. He says:   &quot;The great good that journalism can achieve has been overcast by the scandals of phone hacking, blagging, bribery, and the corruption endemic in too cosy a relationship between press and politicians.  It is exhilarating that leading foundations are co-operating to recognise excellence in the press and doing it for the whole of Europe at a time when the European ideal is under siege.&quot;   The winners will be announced in January and their awards will be presented at a congress of Europe&apos;s media foundations in Amsterdam on 26 February 2013.  The other five founding bodies are two from the Netherlands, Stichting Democratie en Media and Vereniging Veronica; two from Denmark, the Jyllands-Posten Foundation and the Politiken Foundation; and the Czech Republic&apos;s Media Development Loan Fund.

Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, flew to Amsterdam on Monday for negotiations with the Ajax financial director, Jerome Slop, and the club&apos;s commercial director, Henri van der Aat. Spurs have offered \u20ac12m (around \u00a39.6m) for Vertonghen, a central defender who has 12 months to run on his contract but Ajax value him at \u20ac15m. Levy, though, having wasted little time in moving for the 25-year-old, is confident of finalising an agreement and the player is attracted by the challenge at Tottenham and living in London. &quot;I have a preference for Spurs,&quot; Vertonghen said. &quot;I&apos;ve got the best feeling for that club and I&apos;m a &apos;feeling person&apos;. They already invited me and want to handle it quickly. They say I&apos;m their only option, which I take as a compliment.&quot; Rafael van der Vaart, Tottenham&apos;s Dutch midfielder who began his career at Ajax, has urged the club to sign Vertonghen and they appear poised to win the fight ahead of a clutch of rivals, including Arsenal. Vertonghen, a Belgium international, is rated among the best players in Holland&apos;s Eredivisie having overcome a slow start to enjoy an excellent season. His performances in the Europa League against Manchester United drew praise. The captain of Ajax who plays on the left of the central-defensive pair, Vertonghen is a composed all-round defender with particular strength with the ball at his feet, a legacy of his upbringing as a midfielder. It was Martin Jol, the former Spurs manager, now at Fulham, who switched him to centre-half at Ajax. Tottenham&apos;s options in central defence will be swelled by the return of Steven Caulker from a successful season-long loan at Swansea City. The 20-year-old will be assessed by the manager, Harry Redknapp, in pre-season. Redknapp also has Michael Dawson, Younes Kaboul and Ryan Nelsen for the position, plus Ledley King and William Gallas. King&apos;s contract expires at the end of next month and negotiations over fresh terms are planned. Gallas has one year remaining on his deal. Levy is endeavouring to reach an agreement for the transfer of Emmanuel Adebayor from Manchester City. The striker, who spent last season on loan at Tottenham, where he scored 18 goals, has one year of contract remaining at City, which is worth \u00a3170,000 a week. They contributed \u00a3100,000 of his weekly wage last season. Adebayor is not wanted at City but he is not inclined to take a pay-cut, making the sums difficult to balance for Levy, who operates a strict \u00a370,000-a-week wage ceiling. Much will hinge on City&apos;s valuation of a player they paid \u00a325m to take from Arsenal in July 2009 or whether they might be prepared to reach a settlement with him over the final year of his contract.", "sentences": ["Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, flew to Amsterdam on Monday for negotiations with the Ajax financial director, Jerome Slop, and the club&apos;s commercial director, Henri van der Aat."], "title": "Tottenham close to landing \u00a39.6m Jan Vertonghen from Ajax", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/24/tottenham-jan-vertonghen-ajax", "tags": ["Tottenham Hotspur", "Transfer window", "Football", "Emmanuel Adebayor", "Ajax", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-24T17:00:54Z", "article": "An Ivory Coast minister has resigned over allegations that he stole \u00a3700,000 from a compensation fund for the victims of toxic waste dumped by Trafigura. Adama Bictogo, the minister in charge of dispensing the funds to victims, stood down after he was named in a police report into missing funds that was leaked to local media this week. Trafigura was found guilty in 2010 of exporting toxic waste from Amsterdam,  which was later dumped in Ivory Coast&apos;s economic capital, Abidjan, in 2006. The company agreed to pay \u00a328.7m to compensate about 30,000 victims. The multinational oil trader denies that the waste could have caused the victims&apos; illnesses, which have reportedly led to at least 17 deaths. The company, which made profits of $1.1bn (\u00a3700m) last year, also said it was not directly involved in the dumping and said it paid a local company to dispose of the waste legally. Bictogo, Ivory Coast&apos;s minister for African integration, had been brought in by the previous government as facilitator of the process to distribute the funds to the victims. A statement from Bictogo&apos;s office, seen by Reuters, said: &quot;Following the most recent developments in the case of toxic waste dumping in Abidjan by Trafigura, Minister Adama Bictogo, who played a role in negotiating compensation for the victims, has asked to be heard by the state prosecutor.&quot; It added that Bictogo had resigned &quot;to ensure and guarantee a separation between the executive and judiciary powers&quot;.

This week, Noises Off is all about theatre that prefers microscopes and looking glasses, which makes real life look strange and interesting once again. En route, we&apos;ll be stopping off in Berlin, in Orlando and even \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 in Amish country, so be warned: things might go a little bit Michael Palin. We start in Germany with a speech given to the Goethe Institute by the Young Vic&apos;s artistic director, David Lan, which he&apos;s allowed me to upload as a guest post at my own blog, Carousel of Fantasies. Lan regularly sends young directors to visit Berlin, intending, as he puts it, &quot;to blow their minds \u2026 to thoroughly unsettle them and shake them up with the discovery of what extraordinary things it is possible to do on a stage&quot;. Weaving from Faust to Hamlet, Lan expresses belief in theatre that embraces paradox, ambiguity and complexity. He argues that life is full of precisely those qualities and to simplify and codify it is, essentially, to fall short. &quot;We English,&quot; he writes, &quot;editorialise, we rationalise, we explain.&quot; That&apos;s not enough. &quot;What I miss,&quot; he goes on, &quot;is a theatre in which the human mind and the human heart have been pushed to the furthest extent and in which they are 100% alive.&quot; This is how he characterises a lot of German theatre, in particular the work of directors such as Thomas Ostermeier \u2013 whose Hamlet played the Barbican last year, Sebastian N\u00fcbling (Three Kingdoms), Benedict Andrews (Big and Small) and Ivo van Howe of Toneelgroep Amsterdam. &quot;It is a theatre of unresolved paradox, of multiple selves, of salvation through sinning.&quot; On which note, what happens when you cross The Diary of Anne Frank with the music of the Carpenters? Believe it or not, that&apos;s what one Orlando theatre teacher and his students put on stage recently in a show called Anne Frank Superstar. So Anne Frank and Peter van Daan flirt to the tune of We&apos;ve Only Just Begun, before Anne&apos;s solo number, Rainy Days and Mondays. (Thankfully, there&apos;s video evidence.) Astonishingly, perhaps, it seems to have gone down a storm. Local critic Elizabeth Maupin writes: &quot;The concept is so startling that it actually works.&quot; In a post largely about copyright, recent graduate Sean Michael Robinson goes into more detail about why. His words should be taken with a pinch of salt, since he was the show&apos;s musical director, but it all kind of makes sense. Words that might be thought &quot;at best maudlin, at worst painfully trite&quot; become transformed in the &quot;mouth of an expressive, and doomed, teenager&quot;. Robinson argues that the approach allows an audience to look afresh and remember that Anne Frank &quot;was a teenager, a pop culture enthusiast who wrote, drew, danced, had crushes on boys&quot; and, above all else, had a life of possibilities ahead of her. Anyway, does theatre have a point when it confirms the expectations of its audience? That&apos;s what Gwydion Suilebhan concluded after a trip to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which has a large Amish population. Among the local theatre offerings were Jonah and The Confession: A Musical. Suilebhan wonders whether theatre that merely reinforces their beliefs is problematic: &quot;If it never tests the limits of the people it&apos;s made for, I believe, it ultimately fails them.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;What I miss,&quot; he goes on, &quot;is a theatre in which the human mind and the human heart have been pushed to the furthest extent and in which they are 100% alive.&quot; This is how he characterises a lot of German theatre, in particular the work of directors such as Thomas Ostermeier \u2013 whose Hamlet played the Barbican last year, Sebastian N\u00fcbling (Three Kingdoms), Benedict Andrews (Big and Small) and Ivo van Howe of Toneelgroep Amsterdam."], "title": "Noises off: Theatre that makes us see differently", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2012/may/25/noises-off-british-theatre-german-touch", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-25T14:17:07Z", "article": "Australia and South Africa will share the location of the world&apos;s most powerful radio telescope, a scientific consortium has announced.

SKA&apos;s huge fields of antennas \u2013 equivalent to about 200 football pitches \u2013 will search the sky for answers to the major outstanding questions in astronomy. South Africa and Australasia had put forward rival bids, and early indications indicated there would be one outright winner. Reports suggest South Africa&apos;s was technically superior, but it was decided that both proposals should contribute to the final design of the telescope. A source close to the talks said South Africa had emerged with the lion&apos;s share of the project, with about 70%. There has been no official confirmation of this estimate. Australia&apos;s bid involves New Zealand; South Africa&apos;s will involve dishes erected in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. Members of the South African team had previously criticised the idea of sharing the telescope, noting that it could involve a climb in costs.

His tone, with its mid-Atlantic edge, is full of sorrow, regret, a touch of defiance. &quot;I don&apos;t know the lingo.&quot; The tale of the Teales is an extraordinary one, spanning four decades, from 1960s gangland London, to a small town in Utah, USA. On the surface, it is a story of the Krays, and their hold on an entire community. It takes in police corruption and bribery, a world emerging from the ashes of the second world war, where criminals rubbed shoulders with politicians, showbiz dined with murderers, where no one could be trusted. But it is also a story about a family torn apart, about betrayal and loyalty and love \u2013 and, at the centre of it, a man who decides at the age of 67 to learn to read and write and in so doing tracks down the beloved brother he had thought for 45 years was dead. Growing up, they couldn&apos;t have been closer, the Teale boys. The middle three in a family of seven, they were war-babies, Alfie born &quot;the night Hitler bombed Lamb&apos;s Conduit Street&quot;. Their childhood was spent ducking and diving, nicking flowers from Covent Garden when they were late for school to stop the nuns at St Joseph&apos;s in Macklin Street from tanning their hides. They shared a bed. &quot;Alfie would say &apos;Witches&apos; trick,&apos;&quot; Bobby remembers, &quot;and we&apos;d all have to turn over at the same time.&quot; Skipping secondary school, they wheeled and dealed (like their old man) down Petticoat Lane, stole bikes and shop-lifted, and did a bit of time in reform school. Bobby was making a go of things \u2013 he had a little boat business in Shanklin, Isle of Wight, and a wife and baby \u2013 when the Krays first came on the scene. But his brothers would visit, full of stories of these lads, as Alfie says, &quot;this smart firm of people who could handle theirselves&quot;. David and Alfie, street-traders by day, were doing a bit of this, bit of that by night for the Krays \u2013 smuggling the odd gun into a club, but mainly entertaining with their jokes and their poetry. Before long, after using his boat to do a mid-Solent drop (&quot;Was it a body? I wasn&apos;t going to ask&quot;), Bobby had been drawn up to London too. Reggie paid for his divorce. The Krays had taken over their mother Ellen&apos;s speakeasy, the 66, in Islington. &quot;And they were happening,&quot; Bobby says now. &quot;They were smart. We were smart. As soon as we came connected we&apos;d get the same respect as they got. Suddenly it was like, phwoah \u2013 this is good.&quot; &quot;You knew they wasn&apos;t normal people,&quot; Alfie continues. &quot;But you didn&apos;t think they was evil people because we certainly wasn&apos;t evil people. Ronnie Kray said to the Firm, he said, two or three times, &apos;These young boys, they work for their living. We don&apos;t have to pay them.&apos; Some geezer barred David and me from a club because David kept pulling all the cigarette girls. Yeah you,&quot; he points at David, who is making a hang-dog face. &quot;I told Ronnie and he went down there, &apos;Don&apos;t you dare bar these two boys, they&apos;re hard-working boys.&apos;&quot; It was glamour and parties, Judy Garland and Talk of the Town, Lord Boothby and El Morocco. And then the violence started \u2013 shootings, hits, casual, mindless brutality. Alfie says: &quot;I&apos;ve been thinking very seriously about Violet Kray, who I adored. Lovely lady. They couldn&apos;t have loved their mum that much to be able to fetch murders on her doorstep.&quot; Both David and Bobby were raped by Ronnie, who was openly gay but had a propensity for men who weren&apos;t, though they didn&apos;t tell even each other until last year. The police knew, but didn&apos;t use it in court. When Ronnie called David a liar, David says: &quot;I looked him right in the eyeballs and said, &apos;Truth hurts.&apos;&quot; The night Ronnie killed rival gang-member George Cornell (one of the murders that was to take the Krays down), both twins and half the Firm fetched up in David&apos;s flat and didn&apos;t leave for two weeks. It was at this point that Bobby, worried for the safety of David&apos;s young family and his own 11-year-old brother, Paul (whom Ronnie appeared to be grooming), became a police informer. It took three years, and the arrival of Nipper Read, for his evidence to be used in court. In the meantime, the Teale boys had spent almost as long in prison, for a blackmail charge they deny to this day. Bobby never told his brothers that he had &quot;grassed&quot;. All three gave evidence against the Krays at the Old Bailey in 1969. (Alfie and David did a deal to get their mother off a robbery charge, though that&apos;s another story.) All three were given protection against reprisals. But a wedge had been driven between them. Bobby wasn&apos;t himself. &quot;I couldn&apos;t understand it,&quot; David recalls. &quot;Your brother don&apos;t talk to you; you think you&apos;re going off your head.&quot; In 1969, convinced that his life was in danger as much from Scotland Yard \u2013 &quot;I knew a ton&quot; \u2013 as from the Krays, Bobby visited his &quot;lovely mum&quot; for the last time (&quot;the pain was like a bullet in my heart&quot;), took the boat-train to France and went on the run. &quot;Someone in the police told me I should stay away for five years. Call it psychotic paranoia, whatever, but I thought I had to get out now.&quot; David picks up the story. &quot;I was told he was dead. I took my mother up to the police station, maybe 10 times. I&apos;d say, &apos;Let&apos;s find out about Bobby,&apos; going backwards and forwards. I&apos;ll be honest with you. It was heartbreaking for my mother. After about three years they said, &apos;Assume he&apos;s dead, we&apos;ve got no trace on him, no nothing,&apos; words to that effect.&quot; He breaks off, stares into the middle distance. &quot;Gutted.&quot; &quot;I spent three years with my mother while she was dying,&quot; Alfie puts in. &quot;Me and my wife. I had the hairdresser in every week for her to look nice. She died ... oh, I can&apos;t remember the date offhand.&quot; &quot;2004,&quot; Bobby says, almost inaudibly, his eyes on the table. &quot;I watched her fade away. She had a stroke, in and out of dementia. She used to say, &apos;Anyone seen Bobby?&apos; And one day, I said, &apos;Mum. I&apos;ve got beautiful news for you. Bobby&apos;s all right. He&apos;s coming back.&apos; &apos;Oh, lovely.&apos; Total fabrication. And the funny thing about it was, she seemed to get a bit better.&quot; In the years after Bobby&apos;s disappearance, Alfie, a good Catholic, stayed put, living in Holborn, married to Wendy, working the streets: &quot;Oxford Street, Regent Street, Tottenham Court Road, stalls, swag shops, cash&apos;n&apos;carries, that sort of thing.&quot; David&apos;s life was more colourful \u2013 he traded antiques in Amsterdam, and &quot;got involved with diamonds&quot; in Sierre Leone about which, if he wasn&apos;t advised to stop, he would talk at great length. In 2010, he was helping people with drug problems, alongside a teacher called Lali. One day he was telling her stories about his past (Charles Taylor, the Krays). &quot;And she said, &apos;You wanna write a book.&apos; And I said, &apos;Lali, between you and me, I can&apos;t read or write.&apos; She got me on to this course and one of the first things I did was get on a computer at the library. Fantastic, when you think of it. Then I said, &apos;Lali, how do I find out if my brother&apos;s dead or alive?&apos; And she said Facebook.&quot; Bobby had spent time in Gibraltar, then travelled to America. He went into construction, married a Canadian nurse and had three children, still on the run in his head \u2013 &quot;Always doing the street-smart thing, always looking, always observing.&quot; He tried to bury his past. &quot;I blanked my family from my mind \u2013 10, 20, 30, 35 years. I was conditioning myself that I would die without knowing.&quot; Then a few years ago, his daughter gave him a picture book for Christmas, Defining Moments in History, and in it was a picture of the horse-drawn hearse at Reggie Kray&apos;s funeral. A huge torrent of emotion welled up in Bobby, of anger and grief, and he found himself having to explain to his children, who were baffled by his response to the book, his personal knowledge of the Krays, and a little bit of what he himself used to be. About his own family, he kept quiet, until a few years later, when he was living in Utah, and married to his third wife, Dawne, whom he met on the internet. He had a new laptop. He had never concealed his real name and one night up popped the message: &quot;Looking for Bobby.&quot; I thought, it&apos;s probably a nut job. So I wrote, &apos;Where were you born? What&apos;s your middle name?&apos; David responded, &apos;Shut up. I&apos;m your brother.&apos; Oh, my God.&quot; Bobby makes a gesture with his hands, clutching his stomach. &quot;It was the most emotional thing I ever felt, the most dramatic event of my life. I thought this can&apos;t be happening. I had given up mentally ever seeing my family again. From the whole of my being ...&quot; His voice cracks. &quot;It was like a floodgate opened.&quot; David rang Alfie. &quot;I said, &apos;I&apos;ve got him.&apos; &apos;Nah, you haven&apos;t.&apos;&quot; It had been arranged that Bobby would ring on Alfie&apos;s landline. &quot;It was 4pm our time on a Sunday afternoon,&quot; Alfie, a details man, remembers. &quot;We have our dinner about 2.30/3pm. David was round. Wendy. My sons. We had had a lovely dinner and just got down. I was still a bit doubtful. The phone rang. I picked it up. I said, &apos;Bobby?&apos; And ...&quot; Alfie croaks, he can&apos;t carry on. &quot;It was very emotional, like an explosion, a bomb going off,&quot; David says. &quot;I&apos;m still feeling it now,&quot; Alfie says. David rolls his eyes: &quot;All right. You&apos;ve won the Oscar.&quot; Alfie gets out some kitchen roll from his pocket and wipes his eyes: &quot;As soon as we started talking, we couldn&apos;t talk \u2013 could we, Bob?&quot; Bobby shakes his head. Tears are pouring down his cheeks now too. He couldn&apos;t wait to get to England. His daughter Tracy, the baby he had walked away from on the Isle of Wight all those years ago, was waiting for him at the airport. She had been told by her mother that he was buried under the Westway \u2013 the A40. Bobby couldn&apos;t take his eyes off her in the car. &quot;Looked a bit like Mum,&quot; he tells his brothers. The boys met at the Holiday Inn in Holborn, central London. &quot;I thought they were entitled to kill me. Not literally, psychologically. I thought I was opening a can of worms. But Alfie said, &apos;Bobby, get here as fast as you can. You will be in seventh heaven. We are going to love you to death.&apos;&quot; There were questions, the past to unravel, police files to unearth, but that came later. &quot;It was just the thought he was alive!&quot; David says. &quot;We was all crying and kissing. We sat there after all those years apart and looked at each other, thinking, is it real?&quot; Now Bobby sits with both hands clasped, almost like a penitent. Is he forgiven? &quot;Yes,&quot; David says, &quot;even if he is one of them petrol tanks. Yanks.&quot; Alfie shakes his head. &quot;Never held anything against him,&quot; he says. \u2022 Bringing Down the Krays by Bobby Teale is published by Ebury Press for \u00a314.99.

His remarkable diction enabled him to shine in patter roles of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas and he featured prominently in that repertoire throughout his career. But he also brought that asset to the landmark Sadler&apos;s Wells productions of Wagner under Reginald Goodall, delivering colourful, accomplished performances of the roles of the querulous town clerk Beckmesser in The Mastersingers of Nuremberg and of the scheming dwarf, Alberich, in The Ring of the Nibelung. Born in London, he attended Salvatorian college, Harrow, and went on to study at the Trinity College of Music and abroad with Elena Gerhardt and Gerhard H\u00fcsch. He made his debut in 1955 in Haydn&apos;s Orfeo ed Euridice, a concert performance at the St Pancras Festival that marked the British premiere of the work. At the same festival he made his stage debut two years later as Publius in Mozart&apos;s La Clemenza di Tito. He then joined the Sadler&apos;s Wells company (subsequently English National Opera) in 1961, distinguishing himself in such roles as Dr Bartolo in Rossini&apos;s Il Barbiere di Siviglia, Melitone in Verdi&apos;s La Forza del Destino, Rigoletto, Papageno in The Magic Flute and a succession of character parts in Offenbach and Gilbert and Sullivan operettas.     Derek Hammond-Stroud shone in Gilbert and Sullivan patter roles. Photograph: ENO    To all these roles he brought an animated delineation enhanced by his trademark diction. His acting skills were also brought into play here: the hangdog expression and furrowed brow of his Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner in The Mikado \u2013 to take just one example \u2013 contributed to an amusing portrayal. Gilbert and Sullivan roles formed the backbone of his frequent appearances at the BBC Proms. Between 1968 and 1988 he featured in 31 performances of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas there, with appearances also in Berlioz&apos;s B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict, Britten&apos;s Gloriana, Walton&apos;s Fa\u00e7ade, Stravinsky&apos;s Renard, Verdi&apos;s Macbeth and La Forza del Destino, and Johann Strauss&apos;s Der Zigeunerbaron. His exemplary diction was a distinguishing feature too of his Beckmesser and Alberich for Sadler&apos;s Wells. During the rigorous coaching sessions for the former with Goodall, Hammond-Stroud gradually became aware, as he once told an interviewer, that the conductor identified himself with the frustration and anguish of the town clerk, treated with much derision by the populace. The singer&apos;s task was thus to project a tragic rather than a comic character. Hammond-Stroud&apos;s Alberich was also richly drawn, deploying incisive enunciation that could nevertheless be varied to dramatic effect. When Alberich cursed the gods for robbing him of the ring, for example, Hammond-Stroud was able to combine vocal colour and verbal distortion to convey the scorn and twisted hatred of the character. After making his Covent Garden debut in 1971 as Faninal in Der Rosenkavalier \u2013 a role in which he succeeded in combining oleaginous deference and self-satisfaction to devastating effect \u2013 he sang frequently with the company throughout the following two decades. Glyndebourne audiences enjoyed his appearances in this period and his debut at the Metropolitan, New York, once again as Faninal, launched a career in the US too, leading to appearances in San Diego and Houston, as well as such prominent houses as the Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos Aires, and the National Theatre, Munich. The classic Met production of Der Rosenkavalier, in which he starred alongside Tatiana Troyanos, Kiri te Kanawa and Kurt Moll (with Luciano Pavarotti in the cameo role of the Italian Singer), was filmed for American television in 1982. Hammond-Stroud was also an accomplished lieder singer, appearing regularly on the concert platforms of London, Vienna and Amsterdam. A performance of Schubert&apos;s Winterreise at the Wigmore Hall in 1979, memorable for its sentient projection of the text, was finally released on CD in 2002. In 1987 he was appointed OBE. \u2022 Derek Hammond-Stroud, baritone, born 10 January 1926; died 14 May 2012", "sentences": ["Hammond-Stroud was also an accomplished lieder singer, appearing regularly on the concert platforms of London, Vienna and Amsterdam."], "title": "Derek Hammond-Stroud obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/27/derek-hammond-stroud", "tags": ["Opera", "Classical music", "Richard Wagner", "Music", "Gilbert and Sullivan", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-05-27T21:09:56Z", "article": "Scotland suffered their heaviest defeat since November 2003 after a dreadful performance in Jacksonville, Florida, ended with the USA as 5-1 victors. Landon Donovan gave them the lead\u00a0in the fourth minute and the former Everton loan signing completed his hat-trick in the 65th minute. Michael\u00a0Bradley and Jermaine Jones also scored and an own goal from Geoff Cameron in the 15th minute, when he\u00a0diverted Kenny Miller&apos;s header past his own goalkeeper, did little to ease Scotland&apos;s humiliation. The Scotland manager, Craig Levein, praised J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann&apos;s team, and admitted he felt frustrated by his side&apos;s lacklustre effort. &quot;It was evident tonight that there was one team out there who were focused and ready to play the game and another one who looked as though they had finished the season and had nothing to play for,&quot; he said. The team Klinsmann managed from 2004-06, Germany, had a more difficult\u00a0night with a makeshift team deprived of the eight Bayern Munich players who were given a week off after their defeat in the Champions League final. Switzerland&apos;s Eren Derdiyok scored a hat-trick in their 5-3 victory in Basel. The striker&apos;s second goal exposed the rustiness of Arsenal&apos;s Per Mertesacker, playing his first game after recovering from the injury he sustained playing against Sunderland on 11 February, and though goals from Mats Hummels, Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle and Marco Reus gave coach Joachim L\u00f6w hope by fighting back to 4-3, Admir Mehmedi re-established Switzerland&apos;s two-goal lead 13 minutes from time.

Robin van\u00a0Persie put Holland ahead with a shot from 10-yards in the dying seconds of the first half after a clever, chipped pass from Wesley Sneijder. Ivelin Popov equalised for Bulgaria from the spot when Tottenham&apos;s Rafael van der Vaart handled the ball and Ilian Micanski scored in second-half injury time when John Heitinga&apos;s wayward pass presented the visitors with their chance. The co-hosts Poland registered their second win in a week while based at their training camp in Austria. Having defeated Latvia 1-0 in Klagenfurt on Tuesday night, Damien Perquis&apos;s bullet header gave them the same margin of victory against Slovakia on Saturday at the Hypo-Arena. In another Euro 2012 warmup game played at a neutral venue, this time Hamburg, Denmark were beaten 3-1 by Brazil. The Danes, who are in the same group as Germany, Holland and Portugal, wanted a testing workout and certainly endured one in the first-half when Brazil went 3-0 up with two goals from Porto&apos;s Hulk either side of Niki Zimling&apos;s own goal. Denmark were more positive in the second-half, Liverpool&apos;s Daniel Agger missing from two yards out and Arsenal&apos;s Nicklas Bendtner having his shot blocked by Tottenham&apos;s Sandro. Bendtner did get on the scoresheet 19 minutes from time when he tapped in Zimling&apos;s low cross. Portugal, who open their campaign against Germany on 9\u00a0June, were booed off at full time after a tepid 0-0 draw with Macedonia in Lleira. The visitors, under the management of John Toshack, were ultra-cautious, playing five at the back and four narrow midfielders and thoroughly stifled the hosts. Even so, Helder Postiga wasted two perfunctory second-half chances to\u00a0seal victory. Greece, who are also based in Austria, could manage only a 1-1 draw with Slovenia when Jasmin Kurtic smashed in an 86th-minute equaliser after Vasilis Torosidis had given the Euro 2004 champions an eighth-minute lead.

A player who has been a key figure in a Manchester United side who have won four Premier League titles and one Champions League since joining them in 2006 has never been deemed good enough to represent his country on a regular basis. How strange. After all, whenever England huff and puff to another sweaty tournament exit, the criticism always centres around their inability to keep the ball, which makes the constant exclusion of Carrick, a smooth-passing metronomic presence in midfield, even harder to understand. So confident was Carrick that he would not be picked for Euro 2012, he informed the Football Association several months ago that he did not want to be on the bench for England, which meant that Roy Hodgson had to name Jordan Henderson on the standby list instead. Jordan Henderson. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t dream of putting Michael Carrick on a standby list after he&apos;s made it clear in the past he doesn&apos;t want to be involved like that,&quot; Hodgson said. &quot;I&apos;d have to be convinced he was better than the four [central midfielders] I&apos;ve selected, and that he&apos;d be happy to come out of retirement.&quot; He shouldn&apos;t have needed much convincing. After his exploits for Chelsea from March onwards, there is no doubt that Frank Lampard deserves his place in the squad, and probably the starting lineup. However, the claims of Gareth Barry, Steven Gerrard and Scott Parker are less obvious. In Hodgson&apos;s first game against Norway, the familiar failings were there. Gerrard galumphed about the place, overhitting passes, conceding possession and injuring a Norwegian with a robust challenge. Parker blocked shots and disrupted moves, but at international level he will not offer much else. Barry came on at half-time, stank the place out, and then departed with a groin injury that could rule him out of the tournament, so England ended the game with a central midfield of James Milner and Henderson. Overall a side as limited as Norway, who have not qualified for a tournament for 12 years, enjoyed 56% of the possession. And still there is no place for Carrick in Hodgson&apos;s beloved two banks of four, where perspiration has been valued more highly than inspiration. Carrick&apos;s reputation took a huge dent when he was made to look second-rate by Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta in the Champions League final in 2009. But then, who does shine against those two? Carrick took a while to recover from that ordeal, but while there have been doubts over his character, it surely says something for his mental strength that he excelled for United last season. Carrick is far from perfect. With his elegant, leggy stride, he should dominate games more, and he is prone to bouts of invisibleness. He ought to score more as well. But mostly he suffers because a lot of his good work goes unappreciated and is not as eye-catching as Gerrard&apos;s Roy Race schtick, which tends to be horribly out of place at international football. Xabi Alonso, a similar player to Carrick, admires his positional awareness which allows him to always be in the right place at the right time. It means he doesn&apos;t have to get his shorts dirty. It doesn&apos;t mean he&apos;s lazy, or a wimp; quite the opposite, in fact. &quot;Carrick is a player who makes those around him play, regardless of the fact that maybe he is not the player that shines the most individually,&quot; said Alonso before Spain&apos;s friendly against England last November. &quot;It is more important to find players who can build a team rather than simply finding two very good players and putting them in the team even if they don&apos;t play so well together.&quot; Those comments echo the praise Paul Scholes, another footballer&apos;s footballer, has received from legendary foreign players down the years, and yet even he retired from England duty in 2004, tired at being shunted around in order to shoe-horn Gerrard and Lampard into the side. No one is pretending that Carrick is in the same class as Xavi or Andrea Pirlo and it would be asinine to claim that his presence alone would instantly turn England into tiki-taka specialists. Far from it. Yet when they face France in the first game at the Euros, defeat is likely and complaints will be made about their technical deficiencies and inability to string more than three passes together. Carrick, more qualified than any other Englishman to provide those qualities, will be on the beach. JS Portugal are in for a struggle You can always count on Uefa to mess up a good thing. In the current format, the Euros are utterly perfect because 16 teams means only the most deserving are present and unlike the bloated World Cup, which has double that amount, the standard is often outstanding. Naturally Uefa plans to expand it to 24 teams after this summer, thereby diluting the quality on offer. A smaller tournament heightens the chances of a genuine group of death; in 2008 France, Holland, Italy and Romania were drawn together. This time we have the delicious prospect of Denmark, Germany, Holland and Portugal in the same group. Not that Portugal will be licking their lips. After a turgid World Cup two years ago, their first warmup match saw them labour to an unimpressive 0-0 draw at home to Macedonia, which will not have done much to raise spirits ahead of their opening game against Germany. Given that Holland reached the World Cup final and that Denmark beat Portugal in their recent qualifier, their manager Paulo Bento should be worried. He claims he isn&apos;t, but even though he can call on Cristiano Ronaldo, his strong side struggled to create chances against Macedonia. It&apos;s so often the dilemma for Portugal: they always have brilliant creators and wide players, but the lack of a top-class striker means they fall agonisingly short. Improvement is needed to avoid a speedy exit. JS Holland need &apos;anti-football&apos; Johan Cruyff described Holland&apos;s performance in the 2010 World Cup final as &quot;anti-football&quot;, but those robust tactics used so proficiently in South Africa could be the best option for Bert van Marwijk in Poland and Ukraine. Cruyff was appalled by the Dutch approach against Spain, with Nigel de Jong&apos;s disgraceful challenge on Xabi Alonso the standout memory of a dour contest, but he may have been similarly aghast when watching a strong Oranje side lose 2-1 to Bulgaria on Saturday. Illiyan Mitsanski&apos;s injury-time header at the Amsterdam Arena secured an unlikely victory for a team who finished bottom of England&apos;s qualifying group with five points from eight games. Holland stormed through their Euro group with nine wins out of 10, scoring 37 goals along the way, but have since seen their rhythm fade. They lost their last qualifying tie to Sweden before drawing a blank in a friendly against the Swiss and succumbing 3-0 to Germany. A victory over England at Wembley followed the comprehensive defeat in Hamburg, but that was, well, against England. Van Marwijk&apos;s preferred formation is 4-2-3-1 but the form of Schalke&apos;s Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has caused him a selection headache. After the striker asked his coach for &quot;a little more faith&quot; he has begun to start games alongside Robin van Persie up front. The Dutch have rarely been short of attacking options throughout their history and are beginning to pay for having too much quality in that area. Van Persie, Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart all played at the weekend alongside Huntelaar, while De Jong and Mark van Bommel were left to pick up the pieces, and their defence suffered another blow with a hamstring injury to Joris Mathijsen. Van Marwijk was caught slapping the turf furiously when a defensive mishap from Johnny Heitinga allowed Bulgaria their late winner. His side could do with regaining that same bite. JR Long may he continue Giovanni Trapattoni will have woken up with a smile on Sunday morning, pleased with his side&apos;s belatedly impressive performance against Bosnia-Herzegovina in the sunshine-splashed splendour of Saturday afternoon. But that grin will have been softened somewhat by the resulting selection headache that has come from the 1-0 victory. Before the game, the Republic of Ireland manager was quick to let the world know that, barring injuries, the door leading to a starting place for the match against Croatia would be firmly shut in the faces of the fringe players: &quot;I hope there are no injuries that would make me change my mind [because in the Croatia game] I will start with my usual team.&quot; However, it may be goals and not injuries that forces a change in the septuagenarian&apos;s famously obdurate opinion. Kevin Doyle has had a dire time at Wolverhampton Wanderers of late \u2013 registering a timid three Premier League goals since October and none for the last three months of the season \u2013 and the Wexford-born striker did little to reassure the watching fans or watching manager that he has put that behind him and deserves his place in the starting 11. He worked hard, as he always does, but it came to little more than a nice lay-off here and there and he rarely posed a serious threat to the Bosnia-Herzegovina defence. Shane Long, however, spent less than half the time on the pitch that Doyle did yet looked far more formidable up front. His intelligent movement and timing allowed him the space to score his seventh international goal in 25 games (Doyle has 10 in 47) with a well-taken close-range header, after some neat work from the deserved man of the match Aiden McGeady. The West Bromwich Albion striker almost doubled his tally close to full time only to be denied by a stupendous, last-ditch scooping save from the Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. Ireland are defensively solid but they wasted quite a few opportunities on Saturday. At international tournaments, goalscoring chances are almost as rare as an Emile Heskey 30-yard-top-corner-net-busting screamer and a confident, competent striker will be needed to convert any chances that come Ireland&apos;s way. Right now, Doyle does not fit that description but Long does. Not many pundits are giving Ireland a chance of making it out of the group stages at the Euros but they will surely stand a better chance of getting past Spain, Italy and Croatia if Trapattoni starts Long, rather than Doyle, alongside Robbie Keane. IMc Germany are still reliant on Bayern&apos;s blueprint The Germany manager, Joachim L\u00f6w, blamed a lack of freshness for his side&apos;s surprise 5-3 friendly defeat in Switzerland but that sounds like a convenient way to avoid criticising the understudies who are plainly not up to the standard of his absent Bayern Munich players. Without them Germany are like an old Hollywood western set \u2013 an easy-on-the-eye facade which is hollow at the back. Without eight Bayern players Germany&apos;s defence were a poorly stitched seam, giving way when stretched. Arsenal&apos;s Per Mertesacker was a rusty mess, slow on the turn (think Hangeland v Young at half pace) and lacking any kind of understanding with Borussia Dortmund&apos;s Mats Hummels. While the 20-year-old Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach goalkeeper Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen stayed pinned to his line, unable or unwilling to take charge as Switzerland peppered the box with crosses that were coming in far too easily from the poorly defended flanks. &quot;Our communication was poor and thus we conceded five goals. It was only a friendly match and there&apos;s a lot to be learned from this game. We made a lot of mistakes, but we still have two weeks and I&apos;m not worried,&quot; L\u00f6w said. Perhaps he is right not to be too concerned. If fit, four of Germany&apos;s back five will comprise Bayern players at Euro 2012. Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Holger Badstuber and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng are all likely to start. While Bastian Schweinsteiger, who often plays deeper at international level, shielding his back four and always providing an outlet in midfield, is also a vital defensive component. Without these players, Germany were like an Audi with a Ford chassis: all over the place. Dortmund may be the dominant club in the Bundesliga these days, but the success of the national team is still reliant on Bayern&apos;s blueprint. Providing Bayern&apos;s players haven&apos;t suffered complete psychological meltdown since their Champions League penalty shootout defeat to Chelsea, Germany will be a much stronger and fluid machine in Poland and Ukraine.

Keen to commemorate his work, the foundation launched a \u00a320m initiative focused on higher education, with research into neurodegenerative diseases as its focus. This grant was of an exceptional nature, significantly over and above our standard grants. Our motivation in awarding such a big grant extended well beyond commemoration, though. This was an opportunity for us to respond to the enormous challenge posed by neurological diseases. There will be more than 1 million people with dementia by 2021 in the UK, with associated costs projected to pass \u00a323bn \u2013 yet funding for these neurological diseases generally is much lower than other areas, such as cancer and cardiovascular conditions. We also wanted to invest additional funds into higher education at a challenging time for the sector. Having decided what the foundation wanted to do, we then faced the critical issue of how to allocate the money. As with any grant (and especially where sums are so significant), the integrity of the decision-making relies entirely on the quality of the process. With the aim of identifying the most outstanding and innovative research, an open call for proposals was issued in January 2011. We received 26 applications and eight were shortlisted. As is the foundation&apos;s standard approach, applications were subject to peer review. International experts were crucial, as UK based reviewers would almost certainly be involved in one of the bids. Guided by Professor Joseph Martin, the former dean of the Harvard Medical School, who served as chairman of the expert committee, we were able to gather some of the leading researchers in the field \u2013 from Harvard, Yale, Paris, Amsterdam and the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig. They all met in the UK to discuss the merits of the applications. From a very strong field, the committee recommended that the funding be allocated to UCL. We were impressed by the novelty and range of the research proposed, the quality of what had already been achieved by researchers and the fact that the work spanned the full range, from basic to clinical. Particularly striking was the evidence of collaborations with other international research groups and with industry. Given the quality of applicants, the committee enjoyed an interesting debate. It centred largely on whether to fund projects focused on clinical questions or on basic science. The more clinically focused applications tend to lead to quicker but less fundamental breakthroughs. The risk involved in funding an application looking at basic science is always higher, but the potential for fundamental advances in understanding and possibly preventing disease is also greater. In the end, the balance of debate tipped toward investing in fundamental questions, although UCL&apos;s bid also had the advantage of having a clinical research facility at its core. The key factor in selecting UCL was the potential for significant research advances based on the exceptional and novel research proposed. Central to the UCL proposal lay the concept of a clinical research facility at the heart of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, the partner hospital of the UCL Institute of Neurology. Its aim is to accelerate the development of treatments and identify future therapeutic targets, leading to earlier interventions for patients. Funding research generally carries an element of risk as there is no guarantee that the research will eventually lead to any significant breakthrough. When investing \u00a320m in a single grant (rather than breaking the funding into smaller parts), that risk is only magnified. But if the risks of making a &quot;blockbuster&quot; grant are great, so too are the opportunities. It makes a statement about the importance of backing a particular area \u2013 and hopefully acts as a morale booster for a beleaguered sector. The privileged position of independent endowed trusts and foundations, without formal responsibility to shareholders or electorates, means they can take risks in their funding decisions \u2013 and a longer term perspective. Most important is the increased potential for highly significant research breakthroughs. We were clear from the outset this would be a long-term investment. Our funding will be paid over five years, after which UCL has committed to continue funding the centre. We hope the award will prove a legacy for Lord Wolfson: a centre bearing his name that will be the focus of exciting research developments. In a wider sense, it is also our hope that this award helps to demonstrate the value of foundations to society, particularly at a time when government funding is under severe strain. Above all, our ambition is that the investment will lead to advances in both the understanding and the treatment of a number of pernicious neurodegenerative diseases. And surely there could be no greater legacy to Lord Wolfson than that. Paul Ramsbottom is chief executive of The Wolfson Foundation This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

The Arty Assassin&apos;s mission is to slay sacred cows and praise musical genius. How long has your blog been going? My blog is but seven weeks old and is a babe that needs the nurture of intelligent and perceptive readers. What do you write about? There are four main sections: the Hit List where I kill off those who are frequently lauded but ludicrously over-rated (Ian Brown, Richard Ashcroft and Tim Westwood); Unknown Pleasures, where I introduce or reacquaint the reader with artists that seem to have slipped beneath the radar (Mary Margaret O&apos;Hara and the Sound); post-punk singles where I analyse my father&apos;s wonderful collection 1981 \u2013 1984 (Felt, Weekend, To the Finland Station, the Special AKA and Marine Girls); Thought for the Day where random musical musings fall into place (anything from the denial of Gary Glitter&apos;s musical existence to a homesick Parisian wallowing in Gainsbourg, Godard and Rachel Khoo). Why should people visit your blog? I want people to hate and love this blog in equal measure. Music is a passion that means I have strong opinions about artists I love and those I despise (being brought up as a revolutionary socialist in Beirut may have fostered this). My aim is to combine the passions and writing styles of Julie Burchill, THE great polemical music writer, and the Guardian&apos;s Laura Barton, who understands the impact music can have on one&apos;s day-to-day existence. All art, all writing, all music is political and I try to tease out the political and make it personal. Fuck Girl Power! If you&apos;re a feminist, say you are and be proud of it. Vive the Raincoats, Mathilde Santing, Camille, Joni Mitchell, Patti Smith, Sleater-Kinney and, as I&apos;m a true egalitarian, vive Scott Walker, Cathal Coughlan, Six By Seven, Sonic Youth, Neil Young, Serge Gainsbourg!

It is 1969, and the conflict in question is Vietnam. They&apos;ve just got married. The protest is also their honeymoon \u2013 and they drag it out, staging two &quot;bed-ins&quot; at hotels in Amsterdam and Montreal. Inviting the media to witness their recumbent defiance, they abolish the difference between the public and the private. This, in my view, is the iconic image of the second Elizabethan era: it captures so much that changed during her reign. When Elizabeth was young, men of all classes wore hats as a matter of politeness. Other habits were equally staid: when British soldiers were fighting Japan in Burma in the 1940s, they were disadvantaged because they refused to try the local rice, and would only eat canned &quot;British&quot; food. This picture, taken a little less than 20 years into Elizabeth&apos;s reign, shows how the cultural revolution of the 1960s transformed life in ways that are still being worked out today. By 1969, Britain had travelled a long way from bowler-hatted repression: the country was high not just on drugs and love, but on the medium and the message. The Beatles led an outburst of feeling and free expression. Here, Lennon and Ono sum up the decade&apos;s assault on tradition. Newlyweds, they let cameras into their bedroom. They probably didn&apos;t know, however, all they were implying by this. As stars, they have allowed the media and their fans total access: the po-faced decencies of 1953 have given way to complete self-exposure as these celebrities treat themselves as public property. It is an outrageous act of communication - and viewing this moment from the vantage point of 2012, in the 60th year of the second Elizabethan age, we can see a continuity with the cultural revolution we are experiencing today. What exploded in the reign of Elizabeth Windsor was the power of human beings to communicate with one another. And yes, Britain led the way with its 1960s conquest of global popular culture. Pop music was above all a freeing-up of words and gestures, its emotive messages sped by the new availability of records, tapes and transistor radios. Lennon saw clearer than any other star how this could become both a form of political campaigning and obliterate all distance between celebrities and the public. This photograph is a visual tweet: Lennon and Ono open themselves to the world in the same way everyone is now doing on Twitter and Facebook. Lennon was to experience the dark side of fame \u2013 shot dead just because he was a celebrity. But in this picture, the utopian promise of the new Elizabethan age is laid bare: everything and everybody, here and now, together. \u2022 Have you taken a photograph that sums up the second Elizabethan era for you?

But it also introduced me to the strangest profession in musical culture. Who was this person with a white stick in his right hand, without whom the music could not come to life? In 1983, in that concert with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, it was a young Richard Hickox. But the mystery of the conductor, what he did \u2013 and it almost always was a he when I was growing up in Glasgow \u2013 and what effect the somehow significant semaphore that the baton carved in the air had on the musicians was almost as powerful a phenomenon as the music itself. That was because the music seemed to flow through this person, through Hickox or Neeme J\u00e4rvi, through Jerzy Maksymiuk or Jukka-Pekka Saraste, into the musicians, and then into the audience. After actually composing it, being a conductor seemed like the most direct route to embodying the music that I was obsessed by, to becoming one with it. At least, that&apos;s what it felt like to me in my bedroom where, to my mute audience of CDs and books, I did my best impressions of what I thought Herbert von Karajan and Arturo Toscanini must have done with the Berlin Philharmonic or the NBC Symphony. That was before I had seen videos of these maestros in action, but I needed to move to the Brahms or Bruckner symphonies I was infatuated with, to find some way of feeling Beethoven&apos;s Ninth or Mahler&apos;s Sixth in my body, and waving my arms around to the recordings and orchestral scores I loved seemed like a pretty good way of doing it. But that wasn&apos;t, of course, to get anywhere near an answer to the question of just what the conductor does up there on the podium. So I have sought to find out what happens when some of today&apos;s most exciting partnerships between conductor and orchestra get together, and how performances of the quality that Mariss Jansons calls the &quot;cosmic level&quot; are made. I wanted to experience and to describe how the life-changing power of these concerts is painstakingly built up through weeks of preparation and study and days of rehearsal, and how it&apos;s realised in the few hours of performance. The real discovery of the rehearsal rooms was to scotch one of the biggest myths about conducting and conductors \u2013 the idea of the conductor as power-hungry maestro. Dictators, a work by the artist and musician Christian Marclay, stitches together 25 LP sleeves of all-male conductors in variously vainglorious poses of maestro-dom: batons aloft, hair gelled, eyes closed in rapturous contemplation of their own brilliance or wide-eyed in mystical musical reverie. Marclay&apos;s piece is proof, it seems, of Elias Canetti&apos;s formulation, in his Crowds and Power, of what the conductor essentially represents: &quot;There is no more obvious expression of power than the performance of a conductor \u2026 He is the living embodiment of law, both positive and negative.&quot; The image of the conductor as dictator is as much a marketing myth as a musical one, and it&apos;s a fiction, at least as it applies to today&apos;s conductor-orchestra relationships. It was not what I saw happening in, say, Simon Rattle&apos;s rehearsals of Sibelius&apos;s symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic, or Claudio Abbado&apos;s work on Berlioz, Stravinsky, and Mahler with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, or Valery Gergiev&apos;s run-throughs of Rachmaninov in London.     The German conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler in the 1950s. Photograph: Bettmann/CORBIS    It&apos;s possible to trace how that myth was made. On the first set of Beethoven symphonies I ever owned, Karajan&apos;s name was the biggest one on the sleeve. When we talk of a particular conductor&apos;s approach to a composer, we speak of &quot;Furtw\u00e4ngler&apos;s Brahms&quot; or &quot;Celibidache&apos;s Bruckner&quot;, a slippage that makes the composers the property of their conductors. Yet the idea of the great conductor as despot is merely a blip in the history of conducting. There was no real need of a separate time-keeper \u2013 apart from what a keyboard player or violinist in the ensemble could indicate \u2013 until the development of larger orchestras in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. And it&apos;s only in the late 19th century that the professional conductor, as opposed to the composer- or pianist-conductor, was taken seriously as a vocation in musical life. Before then, to be merely a conductor was an economic and professional impossibility. The vast majority of the 19th century&apos;s most important conductors were also its composers: Mendelssohn, who revived Bach&apos;s St Matthew Passion for audiences in Leipzig, Berlioz, Weber, Liszt, and, above all, Wagner. Wagner&apos;s treatise On Conducting formulates a theory of interpretation that just happens to give a philosophical underpinning for Wagner&apos;s own performance practice and rails against what he sees as the prosaic and inexpressive conducting of Mendelssohn. Wagner&apos;s interpretative licence on the podium was the catalyst for a debate that still rages today, between advocates of textual propriety on the one hand and those who see the score as the basis for creative exploration rather than literal translation \u2013 as if such a thing were even possible. In the 20th century, the great antipodes of this supposed split were Arturo Toscanini, who relished hearing &quot;just what was written&quot; in his recordings, and Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, whose performances were thought to amount more to recreations than renditions of the music he played. With the developing machinery of the record industry later in the 20th century, through broadcasting on radio, TV, and film, the conductor could be elevated to the realms of the seemingly all-powerful autocrat. Yet none of them, not Bernstein, not Carlos Kleiber, not Karajan, means anything without their musicians. But it&apos;s only in watching how performances are made, from the rehearsal room to the concert hall, in observing how the connection between conductors and their musicians is created, sustained and sometimes transcended, that you can understand the subtlety of the relationship. The last thing the best conductors do is to force a group of musicians to do their bidding. In Lucerne, Abbado uses one word more than any other in his rehearsals: &quot;listen&quot;. Performances are constructed through patient hours of listening, so that each player has the chance to build up a similar mental, musical and emotional map of the piece in question. In the performances, the charmed circle of listening expands to include the audience, too, so that in hearing these concerts live in Lucerne, you aren&apos;t simply letting a musical experience happen to you, you&apos;re an active, essential part of it. Rattle&apos;s relationship with the Berlin Philharmonic is founded on similar principles of collaboration. He isn&apos;t trying to control his musicians \u2013 an impossible task in any case, given the cast of virtuosos that makes up this most powerfully individualistic of all orchestras, which he compares to a force of nature, &quot;like lava&quot;. Instead, he&apos;s continually shaping and moulding the orchestra&apos;s sound, and he&apos;s surprised by it as well. Music that he thought he knew \u2013 the late symphonies of Sibelius \u2013 is transformed expressively, structurally, by the Berliners&apos; performances. Jonathan Nott creates a positive feedback loop between the energy he puts into his rehearsals and performances in Bamberg and what the orchestra gives back to him; Gergiev needs the London Symphony Orchestra to catalyse his imagination; and even Ivan Fischer, the most suspicious of conductors of today&apos;s orchestral democracies, says he needs to be inspired as much by his orchestra as the musicians should be by him.     The London Symphony Orchestra conducted by  Francois-Xavier Roth in 2007. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    And yet there&apos;s a complicated psychology at work in these relationships, depending on the history of the orchestra, its function and constitution, and its cultural and political significance within each city and country. The London Symphony Orchestra works harder than any other orchestra I&apos;ve studied, and the musicians are paid for how much they play \u2013 a completely different system and psychology from the much larger and more stable salaries of the orchestras in Berlin, Bamberg or Amsterdam. In Lucerne, the atmosphere is more that of the ideal youth orchestra, a truly festive coming together of musicians that is independent of worldly concerns, such as job security, with which everyday orchestras have to contend. And while it&apos;s true that every player I spoke to, from London to Lucerne, wants to feel valued as an individual musician as well as part of the collective, they also would not tolerate a lack of inspiration or leadership from the person on the podium. As Kolja Blacher, soloist and ex-leader of the Berlin Philharmonic and now leader of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, says: &quot;There is a sociological difficulty nowadays, where personal liberty is so important to everybody. So why stick with this very un-free job of being an orchestral musician?&quot; The answer is to be found in those &quot;cosmic&quot; performances, where, in a truly alchemical transformation of elements, something is achieved that goes beyond the egos of the players or the conductors and the only choice is to follow the musical energy that&apos;s being created on stage. How you get there is wildly different from one orchestra to another, even from one player to another. The profession that seemed ridiculous little more than a century and a half ago has grown up. As a whole, it needs to become more diverse and more representative \u2013 none of the world&apos;s great orchestras works with enough female conductors, for example. But the new possibilities and new meanings that orchestras and conductors are giving to music all over the world, from Gustavo Dudamel in Venezuela and Los Angeles to Andris Nelsons with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, show that orchestral concerts are as capable of reflecting and transforming the world and our imaginations as ever. The trick, as it has always been, is to keep listening, whether you&apos;re in the audience, in the orchestra, or on the podium. \u2022 Tom Service&apos;s Music as Alchemy: Journeys with Great Conductors and Their Orchestras is published by Faber on 7 June (\u00a318.99).", "sentences": ["The London Symphony Orchestra works harder than any other orchestra I&apos;ve studied, and the musicians are paid for how much they play \u2013 a completely different system and psychology from the much larger and more stable salaries of the orchestras in Berlin, Bamberg or Amsterdam."], "title": "Mystery of the maestros: what are conductors for?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/01/mystery-maestros-what-are-conductors-for", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Music", "Berlin Philharmonic", "Simon Rattle", "Claudio Abbado", "Richard Wagner", "London Symphony Orchestra", "City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-02T23:03:02Z", "article": "The data standstill caused by a rubber-hungry squirrel in Andrew Blum&apos;s garden marked the beginning of a two-year quest to uncover the physical world of the internet.

However, one unpromising box did hide a real treasure: a superb purple velvet cloth embroidered in silk and gold wire, paid for by the women of the community to celebrate the last Diamond Jubilee, of Queen Victoria in 1897. It will go on public display in the oldest Ashkenazi synagogue in London this summer, for the first time since it was folded away carefully after the last celebrations. It came out of the box in pristine condition, the gold shimmering as if it was embroidered yesterday. &quot;This would have cost a fortune, hundreds of pounds, and it was a magnificent achievement for the women of our synagogue,&quot; said Jeremy Freedman, one of the descendants of the founding fathers of the synagogue. &quot;This was never a wealthy community: these women were market traders in Petticoat Lane, people came to the synagogue on alternate days \u2013 one would come here and the other would mind both stalls, the next day they&apos;d change places.

They then bought the freehold and ingeniously adapted the building to align it towards Jerusalem while retaining a remarkable amount of the Georgian interior. A \u00a3400,000 restoration of the roof and interior was recently completed with major grants from English Heritage for the Grade II-listed building, after the discovery that bomb damage from the Blitz had shifted the roof timbers so that they were resting only on decaying plaster.

The 44th and the 42nd occupant of the White House are side-by-side at three Manhattan fundraisers designed to stock Obama&apos;s warchest in anticpation of a tough election battle ahead. The events promise to net several million dollars, but at a possible cost of reviving discussions about their fraught relationship sparked by recent off-message comments by Clinton. In a CNN interview last week, Clinton took a sharply divergent line on Obama&apos;s opponent, Mitt Romney. He remarked on Romney&apos;s &quot;sterling&quot; business record \u2013 a discordant note given that the Obama For America team was at that moment launching a sustained attack on Romney for his time at the private equity firm, Bain Capital. In the same CNN interview, Clinton stressed that he was convinced Obama would win the November election by &quot;five or six points&quot;, but those remarks were drowned out amid the cacophony of the 24-hours news cycle. Obama is stepping up his fundraising activities, aware that he faces a daunting army of Republican outliers that threatens to carpet-bomb the nation with $1bn-worth of negative attack ads. With that prospect on the horizon, Obama clearly sees Clinton as a valuable political and financial asset. The benefit to Obama is heightened by his difficulties with the economy, in the wake of last week&apos;s poor job figures that saw unemployment rise to 8.2%. Clinton brings with him memories of happier economic times, given the relative prosperity of the 1990s. The two presidents, who last appeared together in Virginia in April, began the fundraising blitz at the grand upper East Side home of Marc Lasry, a private supporter of Obama&apos;s. Lasry is a principal partner at an asset management firm that has about $13bn under its control. Following food offerings of pigs in a blanket, shrimp and sushi rolls, Clinton said a few words, sticking this time to a more on-message theme that compared the Republican party&apos;s economic policy to the financial meltdown in Europe, saying that it had &quot;adopted Europe&apos;s economic policy&quot; and was propagating the politics of &quot;constant conflict.&quot; Obama, on his part, used the gathering of wealthy Democratic donors to try to wrap himself in a centrist mantle by praising Clinton&apos;s record as a moderate. He said: &quot;There were times when Democrats got a little excessive. We had a little too much faith in government; a little too much faith in regulation... [and] Bill Clinton helped to correct some of our excesses.&quot; The presidential double act will regroup at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel for a gala, where some 500 guests will contribute a total of $1.3m to hear Jon Bon Jovi. The trilogy events ends on Broadway at at the New Amsterdam theatre where the cheapest tickets are priced $250, bringing the grand total for the evening to more than $4m. That is just the start of Obama&apos;s efforts to milk New York City of its riches. Next week Sarah Jessica Parker, backed by Vogue editor Anna Wintour, will wade into the fray by holding a dinner at her Manhattan home on behalf of the person whom she calls in a new TV advert, &quot;that guy&quot;. &quot;The guy who ended the war in Iraq, the guy who says you should be able to marry anyone you want, the guy who created four million jobs,&quot; she says. The New York events are testimony to the enduring money-drawing power of Bill Clinton. Both through his own philanthropic efforts at the Clinton Global Initiative, that have raised more than $57bn in commitments over the past five years, and as a leading Democratic figure, the former president has proved to be one of the most successful fundraisers in US history. But Clinton&apos;s value to Obama has long been qualified by suspicion verging on occasional open hostility. Amid the brutal 2008 primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Obama, much of the open animosity between the two sides was directed to and from Bill. Bill famously called Obama a &quot;fairy tale&quot; candidate, while Obama reciprocated by calling Bill&apos;s intervention in the presidential race &quot;pretty troubling&quot;. Though there has been a thawing since Obama entered the White House, with Clinton lending him valuable support during his Congressional struggles over healthcare reform, there have been periodic difficulties. Last year Clinton brought out a book on economic policy called Back to Work that was interpreted, at least in part, as criticism of Obama&apos;s handling of the financial crisis. Despite the ongoing tensions, tonight&apos;s events underline that Obama still needs Clinton. And it is possible that Clinton needs Obama, particularly if Hillary ignores her own protestations to the contrary and decides to run for the White House in 2016.", "sentences": ["The trilogy events ends on Broadway at at the New Amsterdam theatre where the cheapest tickets are priced $250, bringing the grand total for the evening to more than $4m."], "title": "Barack Obama and Bill Clinton unite for New York City fundraising blitz", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/04/obama-clinton-new-york-fundraiser", "tags": ["Barack Obama", "Bill Clinton", "US elections 2012", "US politics", "New York", "US news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-05T12:35:23Z", "article": "&apos;In 1966, English football changed forever. Alf Ramsey led his wingless wonders to the World Cup and Allen Wade sat down to start writing the FA Guide to Training and Coaching, a book that, published the following year, became a Bible to a generations of coaches. Wade&apos;s thinking chimed with that of Ramsey, whose success legitimised an approach that might otherwise have been thought of as overly negative. His name may barely be known today outside professional coaching circles, but Wade was arguably the most influential post-war English football theorist. His book and his courses informed the thinking of the likes of Bobby Houghton, Dave Sexton, Don Howe and Roy Hodgson. The team, Wade realised, is a system: the actions of one player have a knock-on effect on everybody else. That revelation had profound implications for the zonal-marking system developed in Brazil a decade earlier. In Kyiv, Viktor Maslov was coming to a similar understanding, as was Rinus Michels in Amsterdam. They used their knowledge to formulate quite different styles of football, but this was beginning of European football&apos;s great schism: roughly speaking, to the north, zonal-marking and system; to the south, man-marking, a libero and individuality. Wade knew what he was suggesting wasn&apos;t popular, which perhaps explains the passing reference to Schopenhauer in the introduction to the FA Guide. &quot;There are, reputedly, two stages through which worthwhile ideas must pass before they are accepted,&quot; he wrote. &quot;In the first stage they are ignored, in the second, ridiculed. Coaching has passed through these stages and is now accepted as a necessary process.&quot; For a long time, players had disdained coaching altogether. Walter Winterbottom, the first England manager, had fought a constant battle to bring tactics and shape-work into match preparation. &quot;You&apos;re going to tell Stan Matthews how to play outside-right?&quot; sneered the centre-forward Tommy Lawton on one occasion. &quot;And me how to score goals?&quot; One of the most famous Len Shackleton quips has him, after Winterbottom has explained how he could interchange with Lawton, asking what side of the net he wants him to score in. Wade was aware that his understanding about the inner workings of the game was too abstract for most players and so he set about devising a series of drills to explain them, playing his ideas into match situations. His FA Guide is a masterpiece of taking a philosophy and generating from it a practical teaching method. He favoured zonal defence and spoke of the importance of diagonal balls and overlapping runs from deep. He prioritised possession (the key difference from Charles Hughes, whose 1981 book The Winning Formula supplanted Wade&apos;s as the main English coaching manual) while acknowledging there are times when it is better to sit back, defend, and soak up pressure. Revolution in Sweden Houghton, who had been a player with Fulham and Brighton, came through Wade&apos;s coaching course with top marks. He became player-manager of Maidstone in 1971 and appointed as player-coach a former school-mate who had also shown promise on his own coaching courses: Roy Hodgson. He moved to Sweden with Malmo in 1974 and two years later installed Hodgson at Halmstad. There they set about imposing Wade&apos;s methods, to the consternation of the Swedish FA which, after failing to make it through the first group stage of the 1970 World Cup, had instituted a technical director, Lars Arnesson, to work alongside the national manager, Georg Aby-Ericson. He envisaged unified playing style across Swedish football, and decided it should feature a German-style libero. Houghton and Hodgson employed a zonal defence, pressed hard and maintained a high offside line. They counter-attacked, not in the way of the Dutch or Dynamo Kyiv, but with long passes played in behind the opposition defence. According to the Swedish academic Tomas Peterson, &quot;they threaded together a number of principles, which could be used in a series of combinations and compositions, and moulded them into an organic totality \u2014 an indivisible project about how to play football. Every moment of the match was theorised, and placed as an object-lesson for training-teaching, and was looked at in a totality.&quot; That, according to Arnesen, &quot;stifles initiative, and turns players into robots&quot;, and, as critics dismissed the English style as &quot;dehumanising&quot;, there arose a debate about the relative merits of beauty and success. Peterson compares it to listening to Charlie Parker after Glenn Miller or viewing Picasso after classical landscapes: &quot;The change does not just lie in the aesthetic assimilation,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The actual organisation of art and music happens on a more advanced level.&quot; Naivety is gone, and there is a second order of complexity. Football began to be played with a knowledge of its inner workings. &quot;What Bobby [Houghton, who was working at Malmo] and myself introduced to Sweden was not so much &apos;English football&apos;, the long-ball game and so on, than a different style of defending,&quot; Hodgson told The Blizzard. &quot;Instead of playing with a team that was very spread out from one end of the field to the other, with a libero who stays in his penalty area and a centre-forward who never tracks back, we set up a system of zonal defence, a back four, people pushing up and, of course, getting the ball forward into the final area much more quickly. &quot;Interestingly, in my first year at Halmstad, we not only won the league, but scored 57 goals in 26 games. I don&apos;t think this has been achieved since. And the Swedes didn&apos;t like the idea that their game was dominated by two English guys. Bobby had won it in 1974 and 1975, I won it in 1976, he won it in 1977, I won it in 1979. It was obviously not with a &apos;Swedish style&apos; and it&apos;s only when [Sven-Goran] Eriksson appeared in the 1980s with Gothenburg that, all of a sudden, it was possible to talk of a &apos;Swedish style&apos;. In actual fact, I don&apos;t know what Eriksson did to &apos;Swedify&apos; the game, except copying everything we&apos;d done.&quot; Eriksson was an anglophile and studied briefly under Bobby Robson at Ipswich before taking the Gothenburg job. After two second-placed finishes, he won the league, cup and Uefa Cup in 1982, settling the debate for the three decades that followed. He too, in those days at least, was obsessed by shape. &quot;Svennis would place us like chess pieces on the training pitch,&quot; the midfielder Glenn Schiller said. &quot;&apos;You stand here, you go there,&apos; and so on \u2026 The biggest problem was fitting all the pieces together and getting them to move in harmony. The defensive part was the key to it all. When we were attacking there was a fair amount of freedom to express ourselves, but we had to defend from strict, zonal starting positions.&quot; Shape, shape, shape Hodgson has clearly evolved as his career has taken him through Scandinavia, Italy and Switzerland, but the basic principles remain the same. &quot;If you&apos;re going to play for him you&apos;ve got to put a shift in and perform, work to a system and be tight defensively,&quot; the Fulham midfielder Simon Davies said after his side had beaten a technically more accomplished Shakhtar Donetsk in the Uefa Cup. &quot;What you get after that is a bonus. We work on it every day. Every day in training is geared towards team shape.&quot; That can, Davies admitted, be dull, and the suspicion is that one of the reasons Hodgson&apos;s time at Liverpool was so disappointing is that bigger names were reluctant to knuckle down to repetitive work. Davies admitted it took a little while for Fulham&apos;s players to be converted, before the results convinced them. Significantly, Hodgson continues to follow the Wade principle of practical game situations. &quot;He gets the 11 that he wants on a Saturday and he drills everything in that he wants,&quot; Davies said. &quot;We&apos;ve got the ball \u2014 it&apos;s never unopposed. It&apos;s certain drills defensive, certain drills attacking, and we work very hard at it. There&apos;s no diagrams, it&apos;s just all on the pitch.&quot; There is something hypnotic about watching a Hodgson side at its best, as for instance, in West Bromwich&apos;s victory over Chelsea last year. When out of possession, the back four stays perfectly in line, moving forward and back as though one unit, the midfield four (or five) rippling according to where the ball was, one advancing, the other three (or four) forming the blanket of cover behind, maintaining a gap of no more than 15 yards, often less, to the defensive line. That&apos;s the strength the 4\u20114\u20112 (or perhaps more accurately, 4\u20114\u20111\u20111) still has. It feels basic, unsophisticated even, but it is tough and resilient. It&apos;s what English football always reaches for in time of crisis, a tactical chicken soup for players in need of something familiar and comforting. It won&apos;t produce thrilling or proactive football, but it&apos;s probably the best chance England have in the Euros. The inquest as to why the crisis has developed can wait; after a century of decline, we can probably hold off another three weeks. There were signs in Saturday&apos;s 1-0 win over Belgium that the Hodgson doctrine is being adopted. He notably singled out Steven Gerrard for praise afterwards. He had played well, and was as worthy of the man of the match award as anybody, but as Hodgson spoke of &quot;concentration and determination&quot; it was easy to imagine a specific message being relayed to a player who has so often in the past lacked tactical discipline. For all their possession \u2014 59% \u2014 Belgium only really came close when Guillaume Gillet clipped the outside of a post with a 25-yard half-volley; if England can restrict opponents to pot shots from their right-back during the Euros, they will have done an excellent job. Belgium, it should be acknowledged, for all their technical excellence, struggled throughout qualifying to turn possession into chances. England restricted them, but Belgium have made a habit of restricting themselves. Other sides will provide England with a far stiffer examination, but they did a reasonable job of stifling Spain in Fabio Capello&apos;s second last game as manager. It is legitimate to ask why England need to play a containing game but at least there seems to be a recognition that this is their best approach. For once a sense of realism reigns and, while it does, Hodgson&apos;s prosaic 4\u20114\u20112, simple, unfussy and solid, is its logical tactical manifestation.", "sentences": ["In Kyiv, Viktor Maslov was coming to a similar understanding, as was Rinus Michels in Amsterdam."], "title": "The Question: Does 4-4-2 work for England?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/05/euro-2012-roy-hodgson-england-tactics", "tags": ["Football tactics", "Roy Hodgson", "England", "Euro 2012", "Euro 2012 Group D", "Sport", "European Championship"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-05T13:01:34Z", "article": "Art and science are joining forces in Indonesia to help educate on issues at the heart of social development through the work of an imaginative foundation called the House of Natural Fibre (Honf). Based in Yogyakarta, on the island of Java, Honf works as a forum to bring artists and scientists together to solve some of Indonesia&apos;s biggest technology development challenges in sectors such as health and the environment. &quot;Indonesia is hindered by inadequate infrastructure and improper use of technology. We want to use art and science to educate people to use technology in better ways,&quot; said Irene Agrivine, who, along with Vincentius Christiawan and Tommy Surya, established Honf in 1999. Honf created the Education Focus Programme, a curriculum with the objective of filling the gaps in technology development through partnerships. Some of those partnerships include Indonesian education behemoth Gadjah Mada University&apos;s microbiology laboratory, and private Catholic university Duta Wacana&apos;s informatics laboratory. Agrivine said that because creativity was central to innovation and problem-solving, Honf includes an artistic element in each of its projects. The education programme also invites all sectors of society to join heads to beat technology challenges at its open-community forums. Honf&apos;s latest collaboration produced the Micronation/Macronation project, an art installation accompanied by seminars presenting innovative sustainable agriculture practices to the public with the goal of combating climate change. The exhibition opened in Honf&apos;s laboratory in Yogyakarta in April this year. The installation constitutes a model farm that includes a fermentation-distillation machine to process hay from crop fields into ethanol as an alternative energy source to fossil fuel. It has also deployed a system to convert waste products from fields into livestock and fish feed, and advocates collecting manure and urine from cattle farms for fertiliser. &quot;The problem with food and energy sustainability is in creativity. We have to be creative in order to discover renewable energy options,&quot; said Ilham Habibie, former chairman of the Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals Association, commenting on Honf&apos;s Micronation/Macronation piece. The model has since caught the interest of farmers in Yogyakarta province, and a few farms have already begun rolling out Honf&apos;s proposed techniques. Honf also conceptualised bamboo leg prostheses for those who lost limbs after an earthquake hit Yogyakarta in 2006. The group chose bamboo for its strength and affordability, bearing in mind that around a third of Indonesia&apos;s population lives in poverty. FabLab Amsterdam (fab labs, or fabrication laboratories, being centres that use digital fabrication or 3D modelling software to create things) then developed the idea. The project has grown to become an international collaboration between Honf and FabLab Amsterdam based in the Netherlands, with cultural research, innovation and technology centre Waag Society, also in the Netherlands, and the Yakkum Rehabilitation Centre, a Christian foundation for public health in Indonesia. Together they are researching how developing countries such as Indonesia can become self-sufficient in prostheses and aim to manufacture the bamboo forms for a price of less than $50. Next year, Agrivine said, Honf hopes the model will be available to the public around the world. Honf is also contributing to health through a performance-based tutorial on alcohol-awareness as part of its Intelligent Bacteria series called Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, which won the Transmediale award, recognising technological contributions to society, in Berlin in 2011. The project is a collaborative art and biotechnology work, observing Indonesia&apos;s traditional local distilling cultures, while distributing knowledge of alcohol fermentation methods to teach people to produce alcoholic drinks using tropical fruit in an affordable and safe way. Homemade alcohol has been responsible for a number of deaths in Indonesia, as it commonly contains methanol. The Indonesian Police Forensic Laboratory confirmed traces of methanol in three people who died soon after consuming homemade liquor in central Java in 2010. Alcohol-related deaths in the country have spiked after the government slapped a high excise duty on alcohol, increasing the price of liquor. Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, which worked in collaboration with Honf on the tutorial, said the presence of methanol in home-brewed Indonesian alcohol is commonly caused by non-hygienic practice, such as the failure to sanitise equipment properly, in the fermentation process. If consumed, methanol can cause vision disorders, blindness or death. &quot;Society needs to learn more about correct alcohol processing technology so homemade alcohol can be safe for consumption,&quot; Agrivine said. Honf also created an art-based tutorial to address Indonesia&apos;s severely polluted water supply. The installation, titled IB:EC [Intelligent Bacteria: Eschericia coli, The song of the river], and which was recently on display at the New Museum in New York, consists of an ecological experiment to provide alternative ways to purify water. The piece is made up of four microscopes connected to projectors that magnify bacterial microorganisms in water samples collected from a river. The water is then purified through a homemade filter, with the objective being to teach people how to make this system for themselves. Indonesian private collector Natasha Sidharta, who has been working with Honf for a number of years, applauds the group&apos;s dedication. &quot;From conducting workshops for children in the surrounding community to providing seminars, [it is] a responsible community group that has an important mission \u2013 to share knowledge,&quot; Sidharta said.", "sentences": ["FabLab Amsterdam (fab labs, or fabrication laboratories, being centres that use digital fabrication or 3D modelling software to create things) then developed the idea.", "The project has grown to become an international collaboration between Honf and FabLab Amsterdam based in the Netherlands, with cultural research, innovation and technology centre Waag Society, also in the Netherlands, and the Yakkum Rehabilitation Centre, a Christian foundation for public health in Indonesia."], "title": "How art and science are combining to solve Indonesia's problems", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/05/indonesia-education-media-technology-collaboration1", "tags": ["Indonesia", "Global development", "Environmental sustainability", "Environment", "Energy", "Sustainable development", "Agriculture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-05T15:38:00Z", "article": "This article is part of the Guardian&apos;s Euro 2012 Experts&apos; Network, a co-operation between 16 of the best media organisations from the countries who have qualified for the finals in Poland and Ukraine. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 8 June.

In the qualifying phase for the tournament in Holland and Belgium he and his partner, Tommy Soderberg, used the ex-Celtic defender Johan Mjallby as the attacking midfielder, backed by defensive midfielders such as Stefan Schwarz and Hakan Mild. It was 4-1-3-2 that ruled and one of the attackers had to work a lot to defend, and even though it was not always exciting to watch, it was successful in qualifiers. In three out of five tournaments Sweden also managed to get out of the group stage, but always ended up going home after that, and Lagerback is remembered as a solid coach whose teams lacked sparkle and excitement. And he won no medals of course. When Erik Hamren took over as the new manager of Sweden in 2009 he spoke of an attacking and more creative style and his aim was to win games and to try to have a more positive approach. That persuaded the veteran midfielder Anders Svensson to continue in the national team, and maybe others as well. Zlatan Ibrahimovic did not play for Sweden during Hamren&apos;s first eight months in charge but it transpired that the Milan forward liked what he heard when he met the new coach in 2010. Not only had Hamren promised a medal at Euro 2012, the captain&apos;s armband, and a free role in the team, he also promised Ibrahimovic that Sweden would try to play an expansive type of football. Hamren settled for a 4-2-3-1 with Ibrahimovic as the lone attacker, and held on to that throughout the qualifiers, although there was a little of a more traditional 4-4-2 in the last game against Holland, a 3-2 win which sealed Sweden&apos;s place in Poland and Ukraine. The manager likes the midfield to be crowded and the full-backs to move forward together with one of the central defenders, who very often are supposed to be one of the &quot;playmakers&quot;. The team made an excellent start in the qualifiers by beating Hungary and San Marino at home. Everyone loved the &quot;new&quot; national team and many believed in a fresh dawn when Sweden went to Amsterdam to play against Holland. Both Hamren and the players spoke about winning against a side then ranked No2 in the world. The 90 minutes that followed in the Amsterdam Arena was like an ice bath. Holland ran Sweden ragged, beating them 4-1 and it could have been a lot more \u2013 the new dawn seemed to be a false one. During 2011 Sweden both impressed \u2013 as in the 5-0 win against Finland in Solna and in the 3-2 victory over Holland \u2013 and disappointed, with a loss against Hungary in Budapest and unconvincing victories in Moldova, San Marino and Finland. The big discussion in Sweden during the autumn was about Ibrahimovic. Was the national team better with or without him? After Sweden beat Holland without their captain and superstar the discussion started to pick up speed, and two poor performances from the Milan striker in the friendlies in November ensured that the question marks remained. Something had to be done and in February in Zagreb Hamren finally did what some experts had been advocating for a long time. Against Croatia, he put Ibrahimovic as the playmaker and had Johan Elmander leading the line. Sweden won 3-1 and the performance of both the Ibrahimovic and the team gave new hope. Is the enigma of the 30-year-old in the national team finally solved? The Swedes hope so. The Milan player now sees more of the ball and can act as a playmaker, and it would be a surprise if Sweden do not start in this fashion against Ukraine. Erik Hamren used 24 players in the qualifiers and it is fairly easy to predict the team. In goal he has Andreas Isaksson with Johan Wiland as backup, but only an injury will stop Isaksson from playing. Mikael Lustig has been the preferred right-back but a lack of playing time for the 25-year-old at Celtic made Hamren try Andreas Granqvist against Croatia. Sebastian Larsson is another possibility because Hamren has only one specialist right-back in his squad. For most of the qualifiers Olof Mellberg and Daniel Majstorovic played together in central defence with Granqvist standing in at times. But now Majstorovic is out of Euro 2012 with a serious knee injury sustained in February and Granqvist, Mikael Antonsson, and Jonas Olsson are now in a race to play next to Mellberg. Blackburn&apos;s Martin Olsson is the current first-choice left-back but this has been a problem position for Hamren, with both Behrang Safari and Oscar Wendt being dropped during the qualifiers after terrible performances. Hamren started the qualifying campaign with Pontus Wernbloom and Anders Svensson as the two defensive midfielders but the former lost his place after the Holland debacle and never returned to the starting lineup. The latter has been in and out of the team, and has played alongside both Kim Kallstrom and Rasmus Elm. Apart from Sebastian Larsson, who started qualifying as a substitute but is now preferred as the right midfielder, Sweden lack natural wingers in form \u2013 Emir Bajrami has had a tough year at Twente and Christian Wilhelmsson has been playing in Qatar for six months. That is why both Johan Elmander and Ola Toivonen have been used on either wing as well as Elm, who can play on the right with Larsson switching to the left. The former Sunderland forward Tobias Hysen is another alternative on the left side. During qualifying both Ola Toivonen and Johan Elmander have also been used in the No10 role, and they are possible alternatives to start there if Ibrahimovic does not get to play there. All three are players that Hamren wants to have on the pitch and Elmander has played in four different positions recently; Toivonen three. The position of the sole striker was Ibrahimovic&apos;s for the most of the qualifying campaign but after the test in Zagreb, Elmander is now the favourite with Hysen and Markus Rosenberg the alternatives. Hamren is likely to pick the players he prefers and trusts and move them around rather than using players he does not rate. Take Elmander for example. Hamren used to coach him at Orgryte 12 years ago and tries to get him into the team in whatever position. It is pretty much the same with Toivonen, who Hamren also has a long association with, having seen him as a child prospect at Degerfors and having tried to sign him when at Alborg in Denmark. Lustig is another one. He played for Hamren at Rosenborg and is the player who has had the most minutes on the pitch during Hamren&apos;s time in charge. Who is the player who is going to surprise everyone at the Euros? He was not a success until his last campaign at Bolton, and he had one huge season in Toulouse, but Johan Elmander has never caught the headlines on the big stage. But in Ukraine people will be surprised by his huge work-rate in attack and he can score and create chances as well. Who is the player who is going to disappoint the most? It is hard to say, because the weak players will hardly get to play, but Ibrahimovic has it coming since expectations are so high, and anything but world class will be disappointing. What is the realistic aim for your team at the Euros? The two most recent times Sweden have gone to a championship with a new coach it has ended in failure. Olle Nordin led Sweden to three 2-1 defeats in Italy in 1990 and the loss to Costa Rica is still a scar. In 2000, Soderberg and Lagerback saw their team fail against Belgium and Italy and also take part in the game that was classed as the worst of the tournament \u2013 the goalless draw against Turkey. So Hamren has something to prove when he takes his team to Ukraine to play the co-hosts, as well as England and France. To advance from that group would be great, and everyone would be pretty happy, and that is a realistic aim for his team.

Protesters looted shops, broke windows and firebombed buildings, including a nursery. Days ago, arsonists torched the home of 10 African migrants in Jerusalem, injuring four, and leaving the unequivocal graffiti: &quot;Get out of the neighbourhood.&quot; On Monday, Israeli TV reported that Haifa&apos;s council had warned local businesses that they risked losing their licences if they employed African refugees, and that shopkeepers in the southern town of Sderot were refusing to serve migrants. Israeli statistics show some 60,000 African migrants have entered the country in the past seven years through the Egyptian Sinai desert \u2013 many of them asylum seekers fleeing repression or war in Sudan, South Sudan and Eritrea. Israel, much like Europe, seems consumed with worry about being &quot;swamped&quot; by developing-world refugees \u2013 although, perhaps in part because of its location, the fears in Israel sound more visceral. So far, Israel&apos;s approach has been to build a steel fence on the Egyptian border and a giant detention centre in the south, and to pass a law that allows the detention of migrants for up to three years. Since its creation, fewer than 150 people have been recognised as refugees in Israel. The crude response from politicians has been as disturbing as the scenes on the streets. Last week, the interior minister, Eli Yishai, said: &quot;Most of those people arriving here are Muslims who think the country doesn&apos;t belong to us, the white man.&quot; He has also described the refugees as rapists and criminals. Weeks ago, Miri Regev, a Likud member of the Knesset, referred to Sudanese people in Israel as a cancer. Former TV presenter and emerging politician Yair Lapid last month lambasted some Knesset members as &quot;inciters&quot; leading a pogrom, and wrote: &quot;I wonder how they have the nerve to call themselves Jews.&quot; The sight of Jewish Israelis \u2013 sons and daughters of refugees \u2013 echoing, pretty much window-smashing act by act and racist line by line, scenes from historic anti-Jewish pogroms in Europe, isn&apos;t an easy one. Nor is the uncomfortable reality that hatred of refugees is so easily stoked in Israel. Having for years practised a policy of separation between Jews and subjugated Palestinians both in the occupied territories and within Israel, the country has incubated a form of casual racism and puritanical appraisal of the &quot;other&quot;, in which anti-migrant sentiments can flourish. Last month, the Israeli historian and commentator Tom Segev told AP: &quot;What disturbs me most is the racist atmosphere. For several years now, Israel society has been moving in that direction.&quot; At one protest against migrants last year, an Israeli demonstrator explained her hostility: &quot;They aren&apos;t Jews. Why should they be here with us?&quot; The language itself is a giveaway: protesters, politicians and reporters alike have labelled African refugees as infiltrators \u2013 the same fear-inducing, security-conscious term used to describe Palestinians. No wonder, then, that the Prevention of Infiltration Law, introduced during the 1950s to stop Palestinian refugees returning, has just been amended to apply to Africans. Meanwhile, gut-level anxiety over demographics are everywhere \u2013 rabbis and ministers are warning that migrants, just like Palestinians, will use a sort of birth-rate-bombing tactic in Israel, outnumbering the Jewish population and thereby sinking the nation. The rhetoric may be ramped up, but far-right Israeli ministers are basically repeating the anti-immigration, anti-Muslim sentiments of rising far-right parties in Europe. That isn&apos;t a coincidence because, perversely, the two have recently found common cause. In the past few years, Israeli ministers have played host to far-right European leaders and made clear the shared values on the supposed menace of Islam and (especially Muslim) migrants. Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Freedom Party, is one of several far-right figures to have visited Israel and met hard-right ministers there. During one trip, Wilders met the foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, and spoke of Israel as a front line in the fight to counter Islam. &quot;If Jerusalem falls,&quot; he warned, &quot;Amsterdam and New York will be next.&quot; This affiliation is great news for Europe&apos;s far-right parties, who seek to sanitise their image, and whose history of antisemitism has been a block to gaining mainstream acceptability. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a research group, has warned that far-right parties in Europe are on the rise in part because they&apos;ve opportunistically buried antisemitism in favour of an apparently more palatable stance against Islam and Muslim migrants. How lucky for them that Jewish Israeli politicians are helping them with that. No doubt it&apos;s comforting for Israel&apos;s far right to find allies that lip-synch claims of a frontier battle. But when the people who perfectly understand you are also the ones with a history of violently hating you, it&apos;s time to worry about what exactly is in this relationship. Israel&apos;s current attacks on African refugees are bad enough, but if this outbreak even partly signals a dovetailing agenda between European fascists and far-right Israeli nationalists, that&apos;s a toxic arrangement \u2013 and trouble for migrants, Muslims and Jews everywhere.", "sentences": ["&quot;If Jerusalem falls,&quot; he warned, &quot;Amsterdam and New York will be next.&quot; This affiliation is great news for Europe&apos;s far-right parties, who seek to sanitise their image, and whose history of antisemitism has been a block to gaining mainstream acceptability."], "title": "Far-right Europeans and Israelis: this toxic alliance spells trouble | Rachel Shabi", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/israel-rightwing-europeans-migration-toxic", "tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-06T19:00:09Z", "article": "Footballers speaking out England captain John Terry is accused of (and denies) racist comments against Anton Ferdinand.

These 99 per centers are stealth softies who are happy to wear concealer just as long as it&apos;s labelled &quot;spot cream&quot;, and to carry a purse only if it&apos;s billed as a messenger bag. Someday, these beleaguered gentlemen will enjoy total pampering emancipation as well as rapturously free access to fashion choices beyond stripy socks. But until such time, stealth softies must cloak their yearning for gender-spanning sybarite pleasures in he-man lexicon. Mind-body-spirit crap will continue to be disguised by tough-guy talk. Personal luxuries will remain reframed in jokey blokespeak. Here is where Man Candles come in. Man Candles, as you might have ascertained from the name, are candles. For men. Because a guy cannot be expected to simply light any old stick of scented beeswax in order to smooth his transition from the assault-and-thrust of his workday to the beer-and-belch of his wind-down. And this is the genius of Man Candles, from American company Yankee Candle. Who can question the testicular credentials of perfumed tapers entitled Riding Mower, 2x4 and Man Town? Riding Mower&apos;s description runs thus: &quot;Hot sun. Cool breeze. And the intensely summery scent of freshly cut grass.&quot; It sounds undeniably pleasant, but a little misleading, given the name. Where are the petrol fumes of the lawn mower, the acrid armpit of the man on the machine? For its part, 2x4 promises &quot;the warm, unmistakable scent of freshly planed wood and sawdust&quot; to evoke &quot;a sense of confidence and quality&quot;. This is the first time I&apos;ve seen sawdust linked with confidence and quality, but I won&apos;t deny the universal appeal of the smell of cut wood. However, in Yankee Candle&apos;s eagerness to provide &quot;manly&quot; imagery for their products, the psychology goes somewhat awry. Despite the natural association of scented candles with home-based leisure time, Man Candles have a troubling emphasis on hard labour and onerous chores. As long as they&apos;re indulging in gender stereotypes, why not go for something more obviously &quot;fun&quot;, like Eating In Front Of The Open Fridge? They&apos;re on firmer ground with Man Town, with its blurb inviting one to escape to the &quot;man cave&quot; \u2013 that fabled nook of any dude&apos;s home where bro-time is indulged and celebrated \u2013 with &quot;this masculine blend of spices, woods and musk&quot;. Perfect \u2013 just the ticket to mask the man cave&apos;s miasma of cheesy socks, petrified week-old pizza and low-lying flatulent smog. But once the stealth softy burns through his supply of Man Candles, he can trade up for the following classy fragrances that smell fantastic while still referencing escapist guy stuff: Nostalgia by Santa Maria Novella is the smell of a new car in an old garage: a surprisingly appealing blend of petrol, motor oil and fresh tyres that finally spins out in a pleasant pile-up of leather, tobacco and vanilla.

My\u00a0husband Olly was standing facing me, the TV screen next to\u00a0him\u00a0now faded to a blank, when he said these words: &quot;You really ought to live on your own!&quot; Moments earlier I had been standing in front of the man with whom I have shared a home for 40 years while he sat in his favourite chair watching television. I had just arrived home from a demanding day&apos;s work, a jagged journey on public transport, and had gone into our sitting room to find Olly watching the box. It infuriated me; anything on at this hour was almost always brain-rot. I hadn&apos;t paused long enough to see that, in fact, it had been an architecture programme, of considerable interest to Olly as, from day one, he has been the driving force behind getting the wrecks of homes we have taken on to a habitable and enjoyable state. My aggravation erupted. Olly leapt to his feet, flicked off the television and uttered his coup de\u00a0gr\u00e2ce in a voice that made very clear this was not a jest. He hadn&apos;t planned to say what he did, but now the words were there. Was this the moment when we had to confront the fact that, for all the decades we had been together, the effort to fit our two very diverse backgrounds and\u00a0personalities into the same house had finally hit the skids? Olly grew up the son of a docker in the harbour area of Amsterdam and went to sea aged 15, as so\u00a0many did in those days, when earning a living equalled survival. His education was travelling the world. I, by contrast, had a middle-class home\u00a0counties childhood, with a forensic psychiatrist father, a formal education and then straight into my first job in journalism. But there were fundamental values Olly and I shared. And\u00a0when our first child, Zak, came along, we were both knocked sideways with delight and wonder at how, for all the fractured nights, the unfathomable bursts of upset and the times he confronted us with his fierce will, he made sense of everything. His brother Cato, born four and a\u00a0half years later, was another adored addition. Times were busy and good. Looking back, I think this change in the dynamic of our relationship was classic empty-nest stuff. The children had recently moved on \u2013 Cato to university, Zak into his own home with his wife Kim \u2013 and suddenly the whole meaning and form of life had altered. The family routines and patterns that we frequently moaned about as\u00a0an imposition were, it seemed then, the very thing that had kept life vibrant and on track. We\u00a0felt the lack of activity keenly: the raucous music, voices on the stairs late at night, the regularity of someone foraging in the fridge, the evenings when the boys stretched their absurdly long bodies over the sofa and we all watched a\u00a0DVD (yes, I approved of that!). Faced with the silence, Olly and I went into mourning, seeing nothing in each other to compensate. It was in this desolate state that we projected on to each other our sense of a life having ended without our consent, and with no picture of another that would satisfactorily replace it. Our home, which had always been the hub of family life, seemed now to lack any vitality but our sniping at each other. So was there nothing to do but say thanks, it was nice while it lasted, but who wants to settle\u00a0for a life in which all we do is make each other miserable? The more we thought and talked about this, the less selling up and having our own, separate homes, with all the desecration of family life it would involve, seemed the answer. Our family history was in the bones of our home. It had evolved and matured with us, ever answerable to\u00a0some new design idea or eccentricity of Olly&apos;s,\u00a0or to my desire for a flamboyant wall, installing a\u00a0sculpture bought on a family trip to Zimbabwe. It had all the markers of life shared. The times we had negotiated life as a foursome, the good, the bad and the ugly memories \u2013 the stuff of four idiosyncratic personalities attempting to live with common cause \u2013 were all\u00a0inscribed here. Instead, Olly and I realised that, as the children had moved out, we could live on separate floors of our building, each of which had a bathroom and kitchen. This way, we could have as much or\u00a0as little to do with each other as we wished. We\u00a0had no idea where the arrangement would lead\u00a0and friends were inclined to mutter: &quot;Surely it&apos;s a way of splitting up?&quot; In fact, breathing space was a relief and a\u00a0release, and we considered ourselves fortunate\u00a0to have a house that made this possible. We found we wanted to spend some time together. We made &quot;dates&quot;, when we prepared special meals. Sleepovers in each other&apos;s domain\u00a0had novelty value. Even as relations between us improved, we\u00a0found we weren&apos;t keen to give up our separate spaces and risk going back to square one. Which might have been the end of the story. Except that, four years later, Zak and Kim announced they were expecting a baby. And Zak, who had left home so emphatically in his early 20s, was wondering how we would feel about them moving in with us when the baby was born. It was Kim&apos;s idea. She grew up in Japan in a\u00a0multi-generational household; she spent much time with her great-grandmother and grandmother, and she wanted their child to grow up with close family links. Unwittingly, she was in fashion \u2013 a survey by Economic Lifestyle found there are currently nearly a million three-generational families in the UK, while the Changing Times Study, by ancestry.co.uk, found we have the highest level of households with three or more generations since Victorian times.     Angela and Olly with sons Zak (with\u00a0Isana) and\u00a0Cato, and Zak\u2019s wife, Kim. Photograph: Dominick Tyler for the Guardian    Olly and I loved the idea, in theory, but we also knew that sharing the same space with our son and daughter-in-law, with their very different domestic habits, would be a sure-fire way to wreck family relations. The only possibility was for them to take Olly&apos;s floor. But what, then, of our cherished separate togetherness? Olly, ever inventive, drew up a design for three ships&apos; cabin structures that could be built around the flat roof of our home. He and I would have one each as a retreat, and one would be a longed-for recording studio for music composer Cato. So Kim and Zak moved in downstairs, and we were there to welcome baby Isana when she was born. She very quickly became a transformational part of our life. Olly and I were stunned by the way her presence filled the home. The structural arrangement meant we could see\u00a0her easily and often. In the early autumn days when she was brought upstairs, I would cradle her in front of the fire, while Olly danced her around the sitting room to tango music. I would take her out in the pram, watching her parachute-silk eyelids drop as she fell asleep to my chatter. Now that she is one, a stout-legged toddler, she has a pre-bath visit most\u00a0evenings and makes her way around the room, tossing toys from their box. In the mornings she accompanies Olly and me to the Italian deli across the road, on our macchiato run. Much bonding takes place. There was the first Christmas, when Kim&apos;s parents came to stay. Although their English is limited and our Japanese restricted to a handful of words, we conveyed, with much bowing, smiling and body language, our mutual enchantment with the baby. I felt an ache of sympathy for them when they had to go, knowing that we had their daughter and granddaughter so intimately intertwined in our life. Falling in love with Isana was the easy bit. Somewhat tougher, and riskier, was for the four of us to work out a modus operandi that would achieve the best of what an extended family household could be, without the obvious tripwires wrecking everything. Probably the greatest of these is being the grandmother who comes bearing advice. Not perhaps easy for a control freak such as myself to resist. I did deliver a copy of Donald Winnicott&apos;s seminal book on attachment, The Child, The Family And The Outside World, and, when Isana was reducing Zak and Kimiko to dust-coloured wrecks from lack of sleep, a copy of Adam Mansbach&apos;s Go The Fuck To Sleep. But in truth, it is far more enjoyable watching Kim with her gentle, &quot;baby-led&quot; way of being than thrusting on\u00a0her tales of how I did it. Olly and I had to recognise that Zak was not coming home as our son, but as a married man with a life quite separate from ours. So, pleasant\u00a0as it is to arrange family meals from time\u00a0to time, popping in on Zak and Kim uninvited is not welcome. Olly had his wrists slapped a number of\u00a0times for letting himself into\u00a0the flat as though\u00a0it were still his place. These\u00a0days, a great deal of texting goes on to organise drop-ins and activities. In turn, Zak and Kim have to accept that our bicycles filling the hall and the way Olly and I\u00a0live in our part of the house, into which they free-flow, is not up for criticism. I wasn&apos;t thrilled when Zak stormed into the kitchen one evening, treating us like nuisance neighbours because we had woken the baby with our clunky footsteps. Kim has on occasion asked me, in her gently firm way, to do or not do something that bothers her \u2013 but the card she gave saying her friends think she has a cool mother-in-law brought her considerable credit. We have all had to dare to say what bugs us honestly, to compromise and negotiate, and to get over conflicts quickly so they don&apos;t pollute the home. And now that Kim and I see each other perhaps\u00a0several times a day, there has come, it seems to me, a fluid, organic closeness. I always thought the world of Kim, but also that I didn&apos;t entirely know her. Now there is a lovely, laughing\u00a0intimacy. Zak has become gentler, mellower, since being overwhelmed with the enchantment of his daughter. Although he is manifestly parent-averse when we bug him, he has put much effort and spark into our multi-generational arrangement. He and Olly, with their shared interest in photography, are forever exchanging information and thoughts. He will flop in my red leather chair in the early evening and talk about new work developments and ideas. He even suggested we go on a summer holiday with them. This animated, restyled home life has also brought Cato, who adores Isana, closer to Zak. On his increasingly frequent visits, he takes his niece to his studio to fiddle on his cellos and guitars or to bop to some tune he has created. She rewards him with a high-five gesture and a\u00a0two-toothed grin. Our extended family is still finding its feet, and\u00a0it keeps us on our toes as, week by week, we learn new things about co-operative living en\u00a0famille. But, most of all, I feel a vertiginous sense of gratitude to our home for being important enough that it persuaded Olly and me to stay put. If we had separated, our multi-generational home would not have existed. Nor would we have had our lives transformed as they have been by Isana. Now we have a new sense of purpose as joint grandparents, pottering off with the buggy, reminiscing all the while about when our boys were young, and anticipating the pleasure of being part of a life that has brought us together, with our whole family under one roof \u2022 Angela Neustatter&apos;s new book, A Home For The Heart: Home As The Key To Happiness, ispublished next month by Gibson Square at \u00a39.99.

The good news: Terry Duckworth&apos;s buggered off. The bad news: it was with all the money son Tommy borrowed so that Terry could pay off Rick, the Pablo Escobar of the north west who had also driven the father of Tommy&apos;s girlfriend Tina to suicide. Still with me? There&apos;s worse: Rick still holds Tommy liable for the debt and to clear it, he must drive a bagful of drugs to Amsterdam. Tina, as is Tina&apos;s way, is having none of it. In the middle of helping Rita prepare for her wedding to Dennis Tanner, bridesmaid Tina grabs the drugs and dashes for the canal. Rick arrives, only to be told that the bag will be chucked into the canal unless he leaves Tommy alone. At this point Rick produces hostage Rita \u2013 resplendent in bridal pink chiffon but in dire need of a canalside cardie \u2013 from his car and threatens to do likewise. He probably expected Rita to quail. He does not know Rita. She has survived three husbands, innumerable other ne&apos;er-do-wells \u2013 one of whom she watched being bisected by a Blackpool tram \u2013 a career as a cabaret singer, and over a decade&apos;s close confinement in the Kabin with Norris Cole. Quailing she does not do. &quot;GERROFF ME FROCK!&quot; snarls Rita before urging Tina to throw the drugs into the water. &quot;He hasn&apos;t got the guts!&quot; she assures her trembling bridesmaid. But Tina makes the trade. As Rick makes off with the drugs, the police she secretly called earlier arrive. &quot;GERRIM!&quot; shouts Rita. They do. In other news, Sunita and Karl have started Doing It. Only a woman married to Dev Alahan could see Karl, eight parts dickhead to two parts gambling addict, as a seductive prospect. But alas, Sunita is that woman and so we must endure his throaty endearments and Sunita lovingly decanting her savings into his pockets for a while yet. If only poker losses could be paid in phlegm, how many of life&apos;s problems could be solved. Since leaving David, Kylie has been dancing at the local strip club. This despite the fact that one look from madam could shrivel a man&apos;s genitals at 50 paces. David&apos;s have only survived because like the rest of him they are not made of earthly flesh, but forged by Satan&apos;s unholy fires in the very pits of hell. When Nick rescues Kylie and employs her at the Bistro, Eva naturally assumes that they are having an affair, and ruins a big do by adding curry powder to Nick&apos;s hotpots. Oh, and finally, Peter and Leanne are each seeking custody of Simon. They are handling the case with the decency and circumspection of two rational, mature adults, ever mindful of the terrible trauma not doing so would cause in the young child for whom they profess to care so much. I jest, of course. They&apos;re one step away from tearing him down the middle and scurrying home with half a body each. They should both be killed and Simon given to Ken. I hate them so much. Something strange is happening to EastEnders. It is Kim. A relative newcomer to the Square, she moves across it like a shaft of sunlight, piercing the gloom. She laughs. She cracks jokes. She is warm, funny, vivacious and we must enjoy her while we can.

Things are normal elsewhere. Ben \u2013 wracked with guilt, we are told, although we have to take this on trust as his face remains less expressive than the average Edam \u2013 has confessed to Ian that he killed Hevva.

Kat gives one slow, styptic blink of her Elvis eyes and sees all. She calms Jean and promises to tear Michael a new arsehole. I paraphrase, but only slightly, and await developments with interest. In Emmerdale Zak has been wandering the moors like an ambulant ball of sphagnum moss. Cain eventually finds him teetering on a ledge and talking to dead people. After a tense cagoule-off, Zak is rescued and sectioned. Robbie, the son Megan gave up for adoption at birth, has turned up. He is \u2013 let us say \u2013 conflicted about her but warms to Declan, especially after his uncle guarantees him a loan for a flat. Val has returned but Pollard has chosen lovely Brenda over his evil cow-wife. Val badmouths David, so Alicia thumps her and now faces prison. It&apos;s a pity she pleads guilty. Anyone on the jury would doubtless have met Val before and therefore would never convict her. These young girls, they never think.

Already down to sing two cantatas in this all-Bach event, she added a third, replacing the previously announced Third Brandenburg Concerto. The new item was Cantata No 199, Mein Herz Schwimmt in Blut (My Heart Swims in Blood), which describes a sinner finding salvation through repentance. Mields&apos;s light and even soprano proved nicely scaled to the piece&apos;s vocal demands; her delicacy of expression never tipping over into emotional wallowing. She was sensitively supported by the period-instrument players, especially in the complex oboe obbligato vividly undertaken by Antoine Torunczyk. She was also expertly partnered by baroque trumpeter David Hendry in the much livelier Cantata No 51, Jauchzet Gott in Allen Landen (Praise God in All Lands), whose extravert spirit of universal rejoicing makes equally virtuosic demands on soprano and instrumentalist. Hendry&apos;s formidable skill and security kept faith with Bach&apos;s notes via an alternately mellow and brilliant colouristic range. Finally, Mields turned to the secular wedding cantata No 202, Weichet nur, Betr\u00fcbte Schatten (Depart, Dismal Shadows), in whose bouncy bucolic dance rhythms Torunczyk once again radiated a benign charm. By this point, the German soprano had assumed responsibility for three-quarters of the programme in a remarkable feat of concentration and consistency. The opening item, the First Orchestral Suite, remained unchanged. Now in his late 60s, Koopman continues to present a gently unassuming figure at the keyboard, directing proceedings with a light control.

TomTom&apos;s shares soared as high as 16.5% on the Amsterdam stock exchange on Tuesday, after the company said its technology was being used in Apple&apos;s latest phone software. With drivers who do not already own satnavs increasingly turning to their mobile phones for digital route planning, TomTom&apos;s share price had declined 40% over the last 12 months, and its March results saw overall sales revenue fall 35% on the previous quarter. Apple will oust Google Maps as the default navigation app on its iOS 6 software, to be released this autumn. In its place will be a new mapping service designed by Apple, which with TomTom&apos;s help will be able to offer turn-by-turn navigation and live traffic information for the first time. &quot;TomTom has signed a global agreement with Apple for maps and related information,&quot; the Dutch company said, while declining to give further information on its deal with the notoriously secretive Californian group. However, the arrangement is likely to be similar to the deal TomTom struck with Blackberry last month. The live traffic information TomTom collects from highways agencies and its own network of internet connected satnavs, which allows satnavs to suggest alternative routes to bypass jams, is being used in the Blackberry navigation app, as are TomTom maps and location content. &quot;The deal is a boost for TomTom because of the huge installed base of Apple product users and because of the brand and all that it stands for itself: innovation, ease of use and quality,&quot; wrote analyst Martijn den Drijver at Amsterdam&apos;s SNS Securities in a note to investors. The deal could have a sting in the tail for TomTom. Sales of its own-brand navigation app from the iTunes store will be dented, as billions of iPhone owners will receive the company&apos;s technology for free once they download iOS 6. Den Drijver said TomTom&apos;s fees from Apple would &quot;largely depend on advertising revenue and a small nominal fee per map if turn-by-turn navigation is used&quot;. TomTom shares rose to a high of \u20ac3.81 (\u00a33.07) on Tuesday morning, a 16.5% increase on Monday&apos;s closing price, before investor appetite subsided. By lunchtime they were trading 12.35% up at \u20ac3.67. Apple has used Google Maps as the default app for iPhones since 2007, but Apple customers have been getting an increasingly second-class service. This is because Google has introduced innovations such as turn-by-turn navigation and enhanced graphics for phones running its own Android software only. Google brought guided navigation to its Android mapping app in 2009, and introduced vector graphics, which render images faster because they are drawn by the device rather than downloaded from a server, in 2010.

I don&apos;t like athletics. I have no objectivity when it comes to the Games. I see them only through a single lens. A hugely expensive global sports day for the world&apos;s elite athletes to perform in front of London&apos;s urban elite.  I&apos;m not the biggest fan of the capital either. My attitude is best summarised by Alan Partridge. &quot;Go to London. I guarantee you&apos;ll either be mugged or not appreciated.&quot; Whenever I go to London by train, I become more northern with every passing station.  I&apos;ve heard all the socio-economic, cultural, political and PR arguments for why they&apos;re officially a Good thing for Great Britain. But I just don&apos;t buy it. My default position is the Games&apos;ll mean little for us in the north\u2026until recently, that is. A friend and I were talking about what we had planned for summer and he dropped in he was looking forward to a London 2012 Festival opening event. Cue my instinctive flinching: &quot;What you&apos;re going all the way down there for, for that?&quot;  &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s up here.&quot; And then he started to talk\u2026 Mate: Have you not heard of the London 2012 Festival?  Me: &quot;Is it something to do with the Olympics?&quot;  Mate: &quot;Ellis, It&apos;s the biggest ever national event of its kind \u2013 a 12 week calendar of 12,000 events not just in London but UK-wide.&quot;  Me: &quot;So what&apos;s the point of that?&quot; Mate: &quot;Well they want to try and spread the Olympics Games beyond the capital and into the regions. Even to places like the North and Cumbria. Did you not know?&quot;     Julie Tait, Director of Kendal Arts International    I started looking into it, and I&apos;m glad I did. It turns out that little old Bowness-on-Windermere (12 miles up the road from me) is our epicentre for the London 2012 Festival. Not just in dear old Cumbria but for the whole of the north. It&apos;s one of only four official opening events outside the capital with the other three taking place in Birmingham, Scotland and Northern Ireland. So basically, if you live in Cumbria, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle or Yorkshire, this is the one! And it&apos;s all free. It&apos;s going to feature 12 up-and-coming UK artists (from across the North) performing an hour long piece called On The Night Shift. Not only that, they&apos;ll be on stage at The Glebe led by what I discovered are one of Europe&apos;s most acclaimed outdoor arts companies. The Toulouse-based fire, percussion and performance masters Les Commandos Percu. And it all happens on the same day they bring the Olympic Torch to the Lake District. Cue embarrassing climb-down; specially as the event is reckoned to be a breakthrough moment in the life of Kendal Arts International, just down the road from me. So I went along to have a coffee with their director Julie Tait, who&apos;s been rushed off her feet and was glad of a sit down if it meant converting a cynic.     More dazzlery from Les Commandos Percu. Photograph: Vincent Blot    She says the event on 21 June has been 18 months in the making. Between now and the opening night, her three members of staff are working round-the-clock on the pyrotechnics, choreography, drummers, sound systems and drama needed to pull off a world premiere in the middle of the Lake District. They&apos;re expecting over 10,000 people, not to mention 30 foreign journalists and TV crews. Festival directors from Barcelona and Amsterdam are also coming and with luck will take the Lakes Alive name back to their committees and consider them for future European appearances. Julie, a classically-trained musician with 20 years experience in the arts, remembers the last time Les Commandos Percu (translated simply as Shock Troops of Percussion) - played Cumbria in 2010. Spectators said afterwards it was like:   something you would see outside Sydney Opera House.  In terms of its own contemporary street arts scene, before Kendal Arts International came along six years ago, Cumbria had only a handful of groups plus the odd freelance juggler or entertainer setting up on a street corner. How things have changed. Julie says:  For us to be launching the London 2012 Festival as the only opening event in the north and one of only four across the UK means street arts has truly come of age here. It now has a presence and a significance that did not exist. It&apos;s massive.   Ruth MacKenzie, director of the Cultural Olympiad, says:   Lakes Alive is one of the most brilliant inventions of the Olympiad. We want to have an event that will kick off the London 2012 Festival in the North and I have the greatest confidence that Lakes Alive can bring those amazing artists, global and local, to create something that we&apos;ll all be proud of.  The day will also be special for seven dancers and five drummers from the north, chosen from more than 90 auditioned. They include Dora Cruz, from Salford, Jess Murray, from Bury, Holly Prest, from Manchester, Mitch Oldham, from Todmorden, Howard Jacobs from Hebden Bridge, Cormac Byrne from Holmfirth and Jenni Wren, Helen Wilson, Al McSween and Laura Simpson, all from Leeds.

Which figures if all you&apos;re doing is imitating your British or American counterparts rather than offering anything original. It&apos;s probably the main reason why we still talk about Golden Earring, Shocking Blue, Herman Brood, or the fact that Little Green Bag by George Baker (born Johannes Bouwens) made it on to the Reservoir Dogs soundtrack. However, the Netherlands was an early adaptor of Chicago house, Detroit techno and rave culture from the UK in the late 80s and that influence has proven its worth. Clubs such as Mazzo, iT and Roxy in Amsterdam were famous in the early 90s, while in Rotterdam the origins of the hardstyle scene were laid at Parkzicht. Gabber (a Dutch slang word for &quot;mate&quot;) was created there as a reaction to the house scene in Amsterdam, which was seen as pretentious. Promoters ID&amp;T helped to popularise the music with Thunderdome parties. They now host the house-oriented Sensation and Mysteryland events all over the world. In the late 90s, trance took over and the rest is dance music history. There are currently nine Dutch DJs in the DJ Mag top 20. Dance music is now one of the Netherlands&apos; most important exports, celebrated each October at the Amsterdam Dance Event, the world&apos;s leading electronic music conference. While Dutch big-room DJs Afrojack, Headhunterz, Fedde Le Grand, Ti\u00ebsto, Laidback Luke and Armin van Buuren rock stages from Las Vegas to St Petersburg, the local scene keeps it cool with labels such as Rush Hour in Amsterdam (regularly voted one of the dance labels of the year by readers of Resident Advisor) and the ever-influential Clone in Rotterdam \u2013 both of which also have their own physical shops, providing a hub for the grassroots scenes in their respective cities.

Now the new breed is ready to take over, with dubstep-influenced producers Martyn and 2562 going worldwide while Rush Hour signings Tom Trago and San Proper \u2013 whose latest album Animal has been mixed by Ricardo Villalobos \u2013 represent the distinct Amsterdam house sound. In the minimal techno field, Kabale und Liebe and Lauhaus have scored several international club hits, while Bart B More, Boemklatsch and Nobody Beats the Drum offer a modern take on banging electro-house, the latter touring the US extensively at the moment. Also from Amsterdam comes relative newcomer Non Records, whose roster boasts the idiosyncratic talents of Kai Hugo and Bear Damen. Hugo&apos;s new album under the name Palmbomen is the one to watch in 2012, coming on like a musical cross between Wendy Carlos and Gorillaz. Up north lies Groningen, the city that hosts the European showcase festival Eurosonic every January. It is also home to Vera club, one of the most famous Dutch venues for indie rock \u2013 its Kelderbar is the place where bands and fans usually end up together drinking with host Peter Weening \u2013 and a ramshackle local garage rock scene. It is also in Groningen that drum&apos;n&apos;bass and dubstep have mutated into something distinctly Dutch, courtesy of Noisia&apos;s razor-sharp productions. Skrillex is a big fan.            Mobile users, please click here to viewSince the late 90s, Dutch hip-hop has mainly focused on rapping in &quot;je moerstaal&quot; (the native language), with popular acts such as Extince, Opgezwolle, Jiggy Dje and the Opposites rapping about everything from the ups and downs of life in the city of Zwolle (two hours north of Amsterdam) to the joys of eating a Broodje Bakpao (a beef-filled steamed bun). The most influential and succesful Dutch hip-hop act is De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig (the Youth of Today), who had their breakthrough in 2005 with the modern Dutch classic Watskeburt?! (What Happened?!). Faberyayo, Vj\u00e8ze Fur and Willie Wartaal rap in a hugely funny and mainly coded language, and have added new vocabulary to the Dutch dictionary. Their producer is influential electro prince Bas Bron, also known as Seymour Bits, Bastian and a dozen other aliases. DJVT are pleasing kids and adults alike on the big stage while staying firmly grounded in the Amsterdam underground scene with side projects such as Le Le (Faberyayo&apos;s pan-European electro outfit with producer Rimer London and graphic artist Piet Parra) and punk-electro group Coevurduh!

His modern take on classical music mixed with hip-hop \u2013 backed by a 50-piece orchestra \u2013 has been a big success at Dutch festivals such as Lowlands and Pinkpop. If that sounds a little too Andr\u00e9 Rieu for your tastes, try Gilles Peterson favourite Jameszoo, who mixes jazz, beats and the noises made by his parrot into a heavy blend of disturbed tropicalia. He releases on the Rush Hour-affiliated Kindred Spirits label, which is also home to Jungle By Night , a group of teenagers who skip school to reintroduce afrobeat to a new generation of Dutch music lovers. The brightest new star coming from the Netherlands right now must be Caro Emerald. With her blend of retro-modern big band jazz and lounge pop, Caro and her production team have made a joyous and clever-sounding album. Deleted Scenes from the Cutting Room Floor has spent longer at No 1 in the Dutch charts than any other album and the accompanying live show is taking Europe by storm. Amsterdam label Dox Records is making some equally smooth moves with jazzy singer Wouter Hamel and saxophone player Benjamin Herman as its trump cards. What about Dutch rock music? Go Back to the Zoo fill Dutch venues quicker than most international bands, De Staat from Nijmegen have already played Glastonbury, and Excelsior Records signings Moss have gathered consistently great international press. And there&apos;s a new generation waiting to be heard: Rats on Rafts, Bombay Show Pig and I Am Oak all have released excellent albums this year. In Amsterdam, the Subbacultcha team play an important role in keeping the Dutch and international indie scene afloat with their magazine, blog and club nights. The same goes for Red Light Radio, an online radio station broadcasting from a former prostitution window in the red light district of Amsterdam. The place plays an important role as a get-together for a likeminded but diverse group of musicians and DJs. So if you pass the Oudekerksplein while trying to find your way out of Amsterdam&apos;s seedier streets, go and say hi, and hear for yourself that the Netherlands is much more than just Ti\u00ebsto, weed and cheap sex. Live act to watch \u2013 Thomas Azier Moving from Groningen to Berlin aged 19, Thomas Azier already had his eyes on the prize. With a blend of catchy German and French electro-influenced pop on his first EP and a stage personality to match his ambition, Azier should be the next big thing coming from the Netherlands. DJ to watch \u2013 Cinnaman The host of the monthly Colors nights recently played Fabric and Boiler Room. The Dutch counterpart to Britain&apos;s Jackmaster seamlessly blends hip-hop, house and UK garage. He has his own stage at the Appelsap festival this summer in the Amsterdam&apos;s Oosterpark. Key venue \u2013 Paradiso This former church at the Leidseplein is the spot every Dutch band wants to play at least once in their career. Paradiso is the place where Prince stripped to his panties in 81 and the Stones like to play warm-up shows before they hit the road in Europe. Also host to the twice-yearly London Calling festival. Key club \u2013 Trouw Amsterdam Built in the former printing office of the Trouw newspaper, this temporary club has a Berlin-meets-Amsterdam feel and is the home of some of the best house and techno nights the country has to offer. Key hangout \u2013 Into the Great Wide Open By far the most idyllic of all Dutch music festivals, Into the Great Wide Open takes place on the small island of Vlieland. This year, the likes of Franz Ferdinand, Willis Earl Bearl and Django Django will play alongside local bands in a relaxed atmosphere. \u2022 Sander Kerkhof is a freelance writer for Nieuwe Revu, DJ Broadcast and Het Parool.

You grew up in Eindhoven but moved to Rotterdam as your musical career was taking off. What are the main differences between the two cities? They&apos;re quite different. Eindhoven is smaller and much more relaxed. It&apos;s only 20 minutes from the border with Belgium, and the south of the Netherlands shares with Belgium a slower pace of life and a bigger food tradition than the area &quot;above the rivers&quot;. Rotterdam is the real Netherlands, you know? The accent and even the language is different. What the rest of the world knows about the Netherlands, that&apos;s what you see in the bigger cities.  Eindhoven sounds nice. So why did you decide to move? In 2001, Rotterdam became the European City of Culture. The government put a lot of money into the cultural scene \u2013 there were a lot of new clubs and festivals opening up. For me, it seemed like a good idea to move there. Rotterdam is quite attractive for young artists anyway. It&apos;s maybe comparable to somewhere like Manchester \u2013 it&apos;s an industrial port city, quite harsh, but at the same time it has a lot of cheap places to live, and abandoned buildings that you can use for something.  We know the Netherlands is the home of gabber and trance. How does a kid from Eindhoven end up getting involved with drum&apos;n&apos;bass? I grew up on a healthy dose of house and techno, but when the first Metalheadz and Photek records came out in 1995, that sound really grabbed me. I would go on pilgrimages to London with a friend. We&apos;d go out to as many clubs as we could in one weekend \u2013 the Metalheadz night at Blue Note, places such as the Leisure Lounge and Complex \u2013 and come back laden with as many records as we could carry. I wanted to recreate that magical vibe in the Netherlands, so we started our own drum&apos;n&apos;bass night in Eindhoven. We didn&apos;t know anyone else who had those records, so that&apos;s how I started DJing. It grew into quite a big venture. By 2000 we were getting up to 1,600 people. We had all the big UK names play there: Goldie, Doc Scott and D:Bridge. Your first record didn&apos;t come out until 2005. How come it took you so long to get around to making your own music? It was never really my intention, to be honest. I was more concerned with clubbing and dancing than making music. But after 2000 there was a split in the drum&apos;n&apos;bass scene. One side became really dark and the other was more melodic, almost fluffy. A lot of people simply abandoned the music altogether and moved on to speed garage or whatever. There weren&apos;t many people making music that was both hard and melodic so I felt that was my cue to start making my own tracks.  When did you have your dubstep epiphany? It was around 2005. I did follow 2-step and garage a little bit but I lost track of it for a couple of years. Then I heard Burial and Kode9 and Digital Mystikz and I got the same feeling I had when I first heard drum&apos;n&apos;bass 10 years before. It gave me a new energy, and it turned out that my ideas seemed to fit this slower tempo. I didn&apos;t even know it was called dubstep at this stage.  Did you immerse yourself in the London dubstep scene in the same way that you did with drum&apos;n&apos;bass? No, actually the first time I went to FWD was when I was booked to play there. But somehow my work resounded in this community, especially thanks to Kode9 who really championed my stuff. You could tell what a close-knit scene it was at that time because when Steve [Goodman aka Kode9] first played my remix of TRG&apos;s Broken Heart, the next day I had all the big dubstep DJs emailing me to ask if I had any more music. It was strange to suddenly be a part of this completely new scene. I think I was the first foreigner to play FWD. As with many graduates from that FWD scene, you&apos;ve moved towards more of a 4/4, techno-influenced sound on recent releases. For me it wasn&apos;t a move towards four-to-the-floor, more of a move back to four-to-the-floor, because that&apos;s technically where I came from. Before drum&apos;n&apos;bass I was listening to house and techno. It&apos;s about trying to find the essence of dance music and making it as personal as possible.  Your tracks are always quite dense and melody rich. Is that because you envisage people enjoying them outside of a club environment? Well, the tracks that most affected me when I was a raver were the ones you&apos;d be whistling as you went home on your bike \u2013 as you do in the Netherlands. The melodic elements grab my attention. For me, the bassline never really sticks in my head, unless it&apos;s something utterly ridiculous. I&apos;m trying to make the tracks that you hum when you cycle back from the rave. Which other producers do you rate at the moment? I like Caribou a lot, especially his stuff as Daphni. It&apos;s really loose. He doesn&apos;t care about the restrictions a lot of producers put on themselves, he just does what he feels is good, and you can really hear that in the music. Another guy I really like is Levon Vincent, an American house and techno producer. He tries to give his music more of a live element so it doesn&apos;t sound like it&apos;s written in little blocks on a computer screen. I also really like the new album by the Invisible. For me, it&apos;s in the same vein as something like Burial \u2013 very moody and rainy. Very London. What about any artists from the Netherlands? My friend 2562 is always innovative, although he&apos;s in Berlin now. And there&apos;s some pretty cool stuff coming out on a new Amsterdam label called Audio Culture.              Reading this on mobile? Click here to view What&apos;s your take on what America now understands as dubstep? [Laughing] It has very little to do with me! Dubstep in the US has taken the place of nu metal. An electronic music rave in America now is like a Limp Bizkit concert 10 years ago. If you listen to a Skrillex set, it&apos;s basically just an orgasmic reaction every three minutes. It has little to do with what dubstep was really all about, which was sort of a meditation on bass. Now it&apos;s like a caricature of that in the US. Is there any kind of underground electronic music scene in Washington where you live? Washington is a weird city because it&apos;s kind of transient. It&apos;s a city where people come to work or study, and once they&apos;re done, they&apos;re out. There are few people who actually stay here long enough to build a scene. There&apos;s not much of a grimy club culture, although there is quite a big gay scene.  So presumably you didn&apos;t move to Washington for musical reasons? No, that was for personal reasons. I married an American girl. She lived with me for a while in Rotterdam and then we decided it was time for something else.  What do you miss about Holland? I think if you move away from your home country, you develop a love/hate relationship with it. Obviously you miss things, but you can also see that country&apos;s flaws, so it&apos;s quite strange to think about the Netherlands now. Obviously I miss my family. I miss watching football. And it&apos;s corny, but I really miss Dutch cheese \u2026 and liquorice! I never thought of myself as a hardcore Dutchman but recently I found myself desperately searching all the stores here in Washington for some salty liquorice and I thought: &quot;What has happened to me?&quot;", "sentences": ["And there&apos;s some pretty cool stuff coming out on a new Amsterdam label called Audio Culture."], "title": "Martyn: 'Dubstep in the US has taken the place of nu-metal'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/13/sounds-europe-martyn-interview", "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Dubstep", "Dance music", "Electronic music", "Netherlands", "Culture", "Clubbing", "Drum'n'bass"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-14T10:49:41Z", "article": "History repeating?

Their first was at the much-mythologised tail-end of the 80s, when indie and dance music swaggered together, and the Stone Roses&apos; debut album became the baggy-trouser-wearer&apos;s bible. Second Coming \u2013 their December 1994 follow-up \u2013 came at Britpop&apos;s high-water mark. Singer Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bassist Gary &quot;Mani&quot; Mounfield and drummer Alan &quot;Reni&quot; Wren had been away just long enough to be greeted like returning heroes. But after a disastrous meltdown 18 months later, the Third was never meant to happen \u2013 at least, if you believed Squire in 2009. &quot;I have no desire whatsoever to desecrate the grave of seminal Manchester pop group the Stone Roses,&quot; he said then. Now, things are different. But are they really? It&apos;s the first day of the Hultsfred festival, deep in Swedish birch-and-elm country. The site is gorgeous, on a lake, with four stages tightly packed together. At noon, it&apos;s been heard that the Roses&apos; crew have arrived \u2013 good news given what happened two nights ago. In Amsterdam&apos;s Heineken Music Hall, Reni allegedly stormed off before the encore; in a YouTube clip widely circulated soon after, Brown called the drummer &quot;a cunt&quot;. A spokesperson responded with: &quot;They had already played their full planned set, so no one walked off.&quot; Fans responded with a sceptical, deafening &quot;hmm&quot;. Still, everyone seems hopeful here for the Roses&apos; first festival appearance in 16 years, and the atmosphere is relaxed \u2013 at least until the music starts.\u00a0LA hardcore punks the Bronx wake everyone up with a joyous, full-throttle set. Singer Matt Caughthran is soon crowd-surfing, then organising a mosh with him in the middle. Maximum effort at 1pm: it leaves everyone beaming. The afternoon continues sparkily. Festival-goers seem more passionate here. Some particular peppy pleasures come mid-afternoon, such as Seattle hip-hop duo THEESatisfaction&apos;s snappy wordplay and dance-moves, and Swedish six-piece Den Svenska Bj\u00f6rnstammen (the Swedish Bear Population). Half-OK Go indie, half Day-Glo Hot Chip techno, they bounce around onstage, foliage in their shorts, and get the crowd going wild. Elsewhere, old-fashioned delights abound. New Zealander Willy Moon rocks up in a white suit like a cross between David Byrne and Jerry Lee Lewis, playing rockabilly twisted with woozy, processed beats. &quot;Wa-ow!&quot;, he howls regularly, as his female drummer plays, stops and smokes. LA&apos;s Vintage Trouble also impress with their Sam Cooke-meets-Stax stylings, which are just sharp enough to not sound too retro. But nostalgic sounds can get tired. Despite a decent romp through the Who&apos;s Teenage Wasteland, the Gaslight Anthem still sound like the Fisher-Price E Street Band. Slash does his best with the Guns N&apos;Roses back catalogue, but new partner Myles Kennedy&apos;s voice never matches Axl Rose&apos;s yowl. Miles Kane&apos;s songs also feel oddly burdened by the north&apos;s indie past \u2013 as does his haircut, the first Stone Roses barnet of the day. At 9.40pm, only 10 minutes late, come the Stone Roses themselves. But where&apos;s Reni? Pulses quicken when a drummer with dreadlocks appears, but it is Reni indeed, wearing a ridiculous hat. As he pummels Love Spreads into life, it becomes obvious how much his drums are his band&apos;s blood and backbone. As the Roses&apos; last open-air appearance proved at Reading 1996 \u2013 I was there, Reni wasn&apos;t, nor was Squire, it was bloody awful \u2013 they need this boy badly. But the pain&apos;s not over yet. Brown stalks the stage, wielding his shakers like someone divining for Es. The crowd aren&apos;t enthused yet; they&apos;re mainly Swedish teenagers after all, not Ha\u00e7ienda casualties. Then comes something Roses fans have been dreading: a wincingly off-key note from Brown in I Wanna Be Adored. It gets worse. In Made of Stone, Brown starts a verse while his bandmates are still on the chorus. Squire&apos;s legendary guitar also sounds clunky and heavy. &quot;I don&apos;t need to sell my soul,&quot; Brown sings, with dead eyes. What is it we want from the Stone Roses? A recreation of a sound that was always inconsistent anyway? Or the dressing-up of a memory? As the set continues, glimmers of hope appear. B-side Standing Here (from 1989)gently warms the heart. Ten Storey Love Song&apos;s melody reminds you how touching this music could be. Brown even takes his anorak off, and starts to joke with the Swedes (&quot;I said: &apos;Tack [thank you]!&apos; I can&apos;t help it!&quot;). And then comes Fools Gold. As soon as Mani finds the song&apos;s fabulous, lolloping groove, they get better. Squire even adds in a bar of the Beatles&apos; Day Tripper. A fan gives Brown a Swedish flag, which he tries to hang up; the third time he succeeds. It&apos;s a metaphor for the whole set, and a totem for what follows. Waterfall cascades; Brown hits every single note perfectly. In a glorious This Is the One, Brown wanders over to Squire, and makes him laugh with his dancing. As She Bangs the Drums sparkles, you remember that friendships dating back decades breathe in this band. You also remember how difficult it was to bring them back. Brown puts his anorak back on. Reni leads. Mani beams. The song the Amsterdam crowd didn&apos;t get \u2013 I Am the Resurrection \u2013 is a genuine, eye-moistening, lump-in-the-throat moment. Brown gives the set list to the person who gave him the flag. Then the whole band come stage-front, and hug. Then they bow, but Reni does so away from Brown, awkwardly, hammily. This is no resurrection quite yet. But the Stone Roses are alive.", "sentences": ["In Amsterdam&apos;s Heineken Music Hall, Reni allegedly stormed off before the encore; in a YouTube clip widely circulated soon after, Brown called the drummer &quot;a cunt&quot;.", "The song the Amsterdam crowd didn&apos;t get \u2013 I Am the Resurrection \u2013 is a genuine, eye-moistening, lump-in-the-throat moment."], "title": "The Stone Roses \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/17/stone-roses-hultsfred-festival-review", "tags": ["Stone Roses", "Festivals", "Ian Brown", "Indie", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Music festivals"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-16T23:06:00Z", "article": "Before the opening of Yoko Ono&apos;s major solo retrospective at the Serpentine this week, she does something unusual: she summons another artist, who on the face of it has nothing to do with her show, to come and join her. But then nothing about Yoko Ono is usual. And when she explains she would like to have Sam Taylor-Wood by her side, you don&apos;t question it. You wait to see what will happen. Yoko likes to do things her way. And, unlike most of us, she knows what her way is. It is an overcast morning as she steps into the Serpentine Gallery looking like \u2013 well, looking like herself. The first accommodation on meeting such a colossal celebrity is to remind oneself one has never met her before. In a sense, she could not be less &quot;colossal&quot;. This legendary but diminutive woman cuts a dash in her regulation black suit offset by a trilby of dove-grey felt. &quot;Yoko&apos;s hair is never a problem,&quot; confides the makeup artist she has in tow, &quot;she always wears a hat.&quot; And I observe they have brought a reserve selection of trilbies. Sam Taylor-Wood arrives a minute later, known to Yoko not so much as a Turner prize-nominated artist as because of Nowhere Boy, the film she directed about the adolescent John Lennon. Sam has a last-minute glamour: she wears a blue and white striped top, as if at any moment she might be thinking of setting sail. She has extracted herself from a house with four children \u2013 including a baby. &quot;I shouldn&apos;t be talking about my children as if I wanted sympathy,&quot; she laughs. You can see how at home with herself she is \u2013 and warm. It is easy to understand why she has so many famous (and otherwise) friends: Elton John, David Beckham, Kate Moss and, now, Yoko Ono. Yoko is eager to show us her work but some exhibits have yet to arrive, others are still bubble-wrapped. This does not deter her. And the tour of what is not there makes one aware of how vividly each piece exists in her mind&apos;s eye. She speaks in a soft, precise, Japanese little girl&apos;s voice. She giggles and sighs. I am struck by her sweetness and animation. John Lennon once called her &quot;the world&apos;s most famous unknown artist&quot;. I suspect there has always been a need to make her voice heard. Eight months away from her 80th birthday, her unchanging youthfulness is astonishing. And, as a peace activist, she has not changed either. When I ask whether she seriously thinks world peace a realistic goal, she answers with determination: &quot;At this point, it is a luxury for us to have negative thoughts \u2013 we can&apos;t.&quot; Optimism is her vocation, as the exhibition&apos;s title, To the Light, makes clear.     John and Yoko\u2019s Bed-In in Amsterdam, March 1969. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    We stare through the bubble wrap at a hybrid photograph of three men: her father, John Lennon and her son, Sean. Whose face dominates? &quot;My father&apos;s,&quot; she says with something between a sigh and a giggle. I can only see John Lennon. She shows us high-heeled shoes in which blood is pooling \u2013 part of her sequence Family Album (1993) about what it is to be a woman. She leads us towards an elegant, perplexing Perspex maze. Difficult to plan? &quot;Yes,&quot; she says, with satisfaction. She shows us two sets of footprints \u2013 hers and John&apos;s. Hers are tiny besides his. &quot;Goodness,&quot; I exclaim, looking at her neat black feet. &quot;What size shoes do you take?&quot; She brushes the question away like a fly \u2013 the answer, in every sense, beneath her. The last room, as though to test what the maze has taught us, asks: &quot;Where do you want to go from here?&quot; We want to go upstairs. And what I am about to find out is that these women have more affinities than you would have thought possible \u2013 in life and art. I am already, in fantasy, curating a double bill of a show in which Sam&apos;s Crying Men \u2013 of famous actors weeping \u2013 is placed next to Yoko&apos;s Smiles in which not-so-famous people, from all over the world, smile. And \u2013 even more tempting \u2013 I would love to see Sam&apos;s beautiful film of fruit as it decays alongside Yoko Ono&apos;s study of a wizened apple. And had it been possible, one might even have explored a connection\u2013 if only because of the intimacy of the ideas \u2013 between Sam&apos;s film commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery of David Beckham asleep and John and Yoko&apos;s famous Bed-In for peace.     Sam Taylor-Wood\u2019s 2004\u00a0video of David Beckham sleeping at the National Portrait Gallery. Photograph: Adam Butler/AP    I am aware, too, of a deeper overlap in the lives of the two women. They are survivors. Somehow, Yoko has lived through Lennon&apos;s assassination (on 8 December 1980). Sam has coped with cancer (colonic and breast). Each woman has experienced painful separation. Forty-five-year-old Sam&apos;s father then mother left her when she was a child. Yoko&apos;s daughter Kyoko was abducted by her second husband, American art promoter Tony Cox, when she was eight and Yoko did not see her again until Kyoko was 31. Yoko also had to weather the disapproval of conservative, aristocratic parents when she first got together with Lennon. They put out a press release saying: &quot;We are not proud of Yoko Ono.&quot; On a more trivial level, there is the older woman tag they have had to live with \u2013 Yoko was seven years older than John; Sam Taylor-Wood is more than twice the age of 22-year-old Aaron Johnson, who played John Lennon in her film and is father to two of Sam&apos;s four daughters. There is going to be so much to talk about. But the conversation begins with a present Sam has brought for Yoko, wrapped in bright tissue paper: a Japanese tea cup and &quot;salty caramel&quot; chocolates from Cocomaya in Bayswater. Sam has persuaded the shop to sell her the cup that was not for sale. How did she pull that off? &quot;I can be persuasive,&quot; she says, and one sees this is true. &quot;I love chocolate,&quot; exults Yoko. The teacup, Sam explains, reminds her of the last time they saw each other at Yoko&apos;s home, in New York, overlooking Central Park. Yoko pours tea into her cup (&quot;I like strong green tea&quot;) and I ask how they first met and we begin: STW I met Yoko before she knew who I was \u2013 at an exhibition in Islington. KK But you met properly through the film? YO Let me tell you how I met Sam, because it is important people understand about how these things happen. She was probably in a difficult situation like I was in when I made the Yes painting in 1966 [you had to walk up a ladder, with a magnifying glass, to find the word &quot;Yes&quot;]. I was in a totally difficult situation in my life and I thought: what I need is a Yes, and so I put the word on the ceiling. I never thought it was about to change my whole life by 180 degrees. STW Amazing how positive a word can be. YO It was that Yes painting that brought John into the gallery. He saw it and said great. Because the thing is that, unbeknown to everyone, John was going through some hard times too and feeling alone. I was feeling totally alone too. KK And are you saying that Sam needed a yes too? YO Yes. She had so much talent and incredible energy. She wanted me to give her the rights to use John&apos;s anthem Mother in her film. I thought, I&apos;d like to see that film and was flabbergasted by it because it was so beautiful. But I must have a very strong prejudice about Englishwomen because I thought, how can a woman make this thing? It was a very bad way of reacting. And then I saw her and she is not a teenager but looked like a teenager and I thought, what is she doing? This is a miracle. I was impressed. Since then, I have got to know her way of life and it is incredible. Did you know there is a very old idea in China that a woman can keep on having a child every four years? And if she keeps on doing it, she can go on for ever \u2013 until she is 80 or 90? KK You&apos;d have a lot of children. STW I am happy with four. YO No [laughs], but the idea to remember is that women have the power. I am not trying to have a baby myself but people might say: she is 80, she does not have to do anything any more. And yet we can do anything we want. We have such freedom with our bodies. ON EMOTION IN ART KK Yoko&apos;s Smiles and Sam&apos;s Crying Men share emotional directness. How important is it?     Yoko's Smile. Photograph: Yoko Ono    STW Emotional directness is imperative. It is so exciting to see [work from Yoko&apos;s retrospective] To the Light, which is so emotionally direct. To see the footprints of John and Yoko walking up the room made me well up. And I think something as simple, beautiful and elegant is what has been lost somewhere. I have not seen anything like it for a while and I need to see it. In the current climate, people want to feel more. YO I think Sam has been a little bit lonely. You see, when you become very famous, other people talk to you and they are not really friends. What you need to share is not what they want to hear from you\u2026 although you try to be truthful. STW I think so. ON TRUST KK Sam&apos;s film of David Beckham asleep; Yoko&apos;s Cut Piece (1964), where she allowed people to snip off her clothes until she was naked involved trusting and being trusted. Another affinity? YO I trust myself. You need that to survive. And how we are surviving is like almost drowning in a tsunami, a big wave. To come out of that, you have to trust yourself. STW Although I had met Yoko socially, we did not have a relationship where I could talk to her about Nowhere Boy. So I wrote to tell her about it and asked: Is there anything you want to say to me? Her response was to trust. No interference at all. And she said something so simple to me that it makes me cry. You said [to Yoko]: &quot;John loved Aunt Mimi and Aunt Mimi loved John and that is all that you have to think about when you make this film.&quot; That was my guiding light through the film. And there was trust between us. YO I really think John would have loved the film. KK The emotional centre of it seems to be a line where John says about his mother: &quot;There is no point hating someone you love.&quot; YO That is beautiful. It is very difficult for us to know we love somebody because it is an insecure position to be in. But in the end, it is important to be honest about your love because life is not that long\u2026 ON SEPARATION AND RECONCILIATION KK John was separated from his mother; Sam&apos;s mother left her when she was small. Yoko&apos;s daughter was abducted. YO With my daughter, the thing that was done was done. I can&apos;t be too hooked on that. But now I am very happy she is around because we have a good dialogue. STW Relationships can go wrong very simply, very quickly, and when you have children you become more aware of relationships around you. I had to repair the relationship with my mother. I couldn&apos;t afford to be angry or feel anything apart from: I need you back in my life. And it is not easy. YO No, it is not easy. STW I remember Yoko saying that if you hold on to anger and hate, it physically affects you. And if you think on a global scale about Yoko&apos;s messages of peace and her peace tower in Iceland, it is all about projection of hope and love. You have to do it on a grassroots level to be able to do it on a global level. KK But, realistically, are you serious \u2013 what chance do we hopeless human beings have of achieving peace? YO The reason we will make it is because we are people who have a tremendous talent to conquer negativity. I really think we will do it. The reason I had to learn about this was when John passed away. I would see the mirror in the morning and I looked terrible. And I would think: oh my God, I can&apos;t be looking like this for Sean even. So then I thought, why don&apos;t I just smile? And when I smiled at the mirror, it was phoney but I kept doing it and, finally, the smile started to come from my body and was very good. But also the funny thing is that, in the 60s, I\u00a0had this vision of everyone in the world smiling together. People might have thought it was a kooky idea. But we are doing it now [in Smile film, part of the retrospective]. It is amazing, isn&apos;t it? It will be very good for healing. ON BRITAIN YO May I say something I really want printed? Countries have lost their culture because what they wanted was\u00a0money. Money became the running theme in every country and culture was sacrificed. With the Olympics coming to England, we can show people what life is about. It will\u00a0be so good for this country \u2013 which\u00a0I have always felt was a very spiritual country \u2013 because of John mainly, but even before John too. There is too much focus on billionaires when this is a country of poets. Let us go back to that! What we need is spiritual energy. KK And yet you both have tremendous physical energy and use your bodies in your work. I was interested that Yoko once said this was narcissism. Did you really mean that? YO What is wrong with narcissism? We need to take care of ourselves. STW I love the idea that Yoko can be a trailblazer of narcissism. I find that I put my body in my work when I am at a particularly difficult or joyous point because I want to feel that moment.     Yoko Ono's Apple (1966). Photograph: Iain MacMillan    YO I was evacuated during\u00a0the war and it was very hard because I did not have much to eat. My\u00a0mother would visit from Tokyo for\u00a0a day or two and what she said was: &quot;You are a good\u00a0writer. Why don&apos;t you write about this? It could be like Gone With the Wind, but more interesting.&quot; From then on, I was always writing in my mind. It is important never to be totally involved\u00a0\u2013 so a part of me is always in a corner from where I am watching myself. ON BEING WOMEN ARTISTS KK How are you seen as artists? YO Women artists are still treated differently from men. STW I had a difficult scenario recently with an American gallerist. He said: &quot;I&apos;d like to show your work, but I don&apos;t know, now that you have four children, whether you are as strong an artist any more.&quot; YO Oh my God \u2013 I can&apos;t believe it. STW I was so struck by what he said, I found myself being defensive. He then listed all these men artists and said: &quot;How can you compete?&quot; I said: &quot;But they have children too.&quot; YO And what did he say? STW And he said: &quot;Of course they do, but does it affect their work in the way it will probably affect yours?&quot; YO No! You are not competing against anybody. When I was 21 and we had a university party, I remember a guy saying: &quot;You are pretty now but in 40 years you are going to look like a fat Spanish woman.&quot; KK How wrong he was! What do you both think of the New York art scene compared with London? STW I feel the art world in New York has a stronger following than Britain. If you go to a New York art district on a Saturday morning, it will be so busy with families and openings \u2013 art is much more ingrained in the culture. YO I don&apos;t know, it goes up and down. I think London, from the US point of view, is really happening now. ON BEING DEFINED BY MEN   KK Both of you have been defined by men \u2013 Yoko on a mind-boggling scale. Is it fair to define anyone through their sexual relationships? STW It is \u2013 in a way. I am happily defined by my relationship with Aaron. It is a big part of who I am and I can&apos;t allow people to come at me and attack. YO In my relationship with John, it is complicated. I would like to think of John as independent and not just my partner because he was an incredible guy and with his independence and creativity, he will do a lot of good for the world. And he has. What I am doing is different from John. Together, we created an incredible, powerful image, but it would not have been unless we had\u00a0been independent of one another. And we were. ON LOSS KK You have both experienced tremendous loss in your life \u2013 how far does adversity feed your art? STW Art is my way of controlling it, not allowing it to take over my life. Sometimes, I get afraid it has defined me, that sense of grief, loss and illness. But actually, it is about allowing myself to take hold and say: this is part of who I am, but not only who I am. YO I say in a British way that everything is a &quot;blessing in disguise&quot;, though sometimes I wish the disguise was less thick. KK How often do you think of yourselves in terms of your ages? YO I don&apos;t. Only the outside world makes me think about it. STW I was about to say exactly the same thing. It is not something I get up and think about. KK I don&apos;t know if Yoko got a hard time for being seven years older than John \u2013 but I suppose that was always a mere nothing compared to the 20 years or so between Sam and Aaron? YO She topped me! STW I am not ever aware of it in my relationship. I don&apos;t think about it. I never think: if only I were 25\u2026. YO We don&apos;t want to be 25 again, do we? [laughs]. ON CELEBRITY AND ANONYMITY KK How often do either of you find yourselves wishing you could be anonymous? YO: Celebrity helps me communicate my work, so I don&apos;t think that. STW Anonymity would be a fantastic umbrella. I don&apos;t like intrusion. KK What matters most to you? STW The simplest things: love, trust and\u2026 YO The first word that came to me is health; spiritual, mental and physical. But also without love and trust, you will not have health. When people ask me what the most important thing is in life, I answer: just breathe. STW And that is amazing because that feels like the essence of so much of your work. When you look at something like the films, there is such humour and simplicity. But I want to tell you how I saw Yoko and the Plastic Ono Band perform in LA. It is one of the most extraordinary things I have seen. I wrote her a fan letter afterwards. It was almost shamanistic. YO [laughs] Maybe! STW You are very upfront with your emotions. And I was surprised because I had thought: she must be fed up with being defined by John sometimes. But you ran films of him and he is still very much with you and a part of your work. YO Yes\u2026 always together. STW And I felt proud of you for being there and still integrating John into your life and also having Sean on stage. I watched him looking at you with loving pride. You have helped me to define myself. People want to know: are you a film-maker now or an artist? I just say: &quot;It is me and I am a creative person.&quot; Yoko makes music, films, sculptures. Sometimes you can&apos;t be defined as one thing. YO Don&apos;t censor yourself! STW And I feel that having my children is as creative as \u2013 and more challenging than \u2013 making a film. ON MOTHERHOOD KK Did it change your art? YO No, although I was not prepared to have my daughter and I was amazed: is this what women go through? We were never told. But from her, I learned to be grounded, which is good. STW I felt giving birth was the most creative act of all my creative acts \u2013 literally creation! YO We are goddesses, creating the human race! STW We are \u2013 and it is as powerful as anything you could ever do. Being a mother is part of my work and world. KK Tell me this then: why be an artist at all? YO Because that is who I am. I didn&apos;t try to be \u2013 but I was always an artist. STW I tried not to be, but I couldn&apos;t be anything else. I tried many other things but I didn&apos;t know what being an artist meant other than being myself. YO Yes. It is exactly the same with me. As she stands up, Sam says the conversation has been &quot;inspiring&quot;. Yoko is still sparking \u2013 ready to talk all day now, it seems \u2013 but the conversation is almost over. I have one\u00a0last question as a post-script: would they have got on if they had met as children? They were, they agree, isolated little\u00a0girls. Yoko has &quot;no idea&quot; but wonders whether they might have &quot;pushed&quot; each other around. She remembers: &quot;I was always very much myself&quot; and, looking at Sam, asks: &quot;Were you?&quot; Sam replies: &quot;I was fiercely independent but I really wanted friends.&quot; And Yoko starts to laugh: &quot;How good it would have been to have an intelligent friend.&quot; Yoko Ono: To the Light is at the Serpentine Gallery, London W2 from 19\u00a0June to 9 September", "sentences": ["John and Yoko\u2019s Bed-In in Amsterdam, March 1969."], "title": "When Sam Taylor-Wood met Yoko Ono", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/17/sam-taylor-wood-yoko-ono", "tags": ["Yoko Ono", "Sam Taylor-Johnson", "Art", "Art and design", "John Lennon", "Culture", "Nowhere Boy"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-18T13:31:22Z", "article": "The atmosphere whenever a manager is sent for a media grilling before a very public boot into the land of unemployment is always profoundly uncomfortable. However much the manager might have earned the opprobrium, however wrong his calls, however low his stock, that moment when it all caves in around him can make you wince as you watch a man confront his inescapable frailties in front of an unforgiving audience. I remember sitting in the room when Erich Ribbeck wandered in to face the music during Euro\u00a02000. The Germany coach cut the figure of a classic fall guy, so weary of it all that it was hard work to defend himself. He had enjoyed 30 years&apos; experience as a peripatetic Bundesliga coach, and had been retired for two years in the Canary Islands when the call came from the DFB to see if he would take charge of the national team. Frankly, he was not its first choice. A string of others had declined the opportunity, but Ribbeck could not resist. Germany went into the Euros as defending champions but they did not win a single game. The final act, in which Portugal&apos;s S\u00e9rgio Conceic\u00e3o scored a stylish hat-trick, saw Germany shorn of quality and spirit. They looked every inch an old team falling to pieces. &quot;You&apos;re Europe&apos;s football twits!&quot; sneered Bild at the time. Ribbeck looked like a hare cornered by hounds as he came into fulfil his media obligations. We were clearly the last people on earth he wanted to see at that particular time, which was fair enough. His interrogators had sharpened their knives and he knew what was coming. He departed his post shortly afterwards. His resignation was shown live on television, a dubious honour normally reserved for chancellors. &quot;The decision is a consequence of the team&apos;s catastrophic elimination for which I take full responsibility,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to clear the way for my successor so he can start immediately with the reconstruction of the team.&quot; In hindsight, that nadir for Germany \u2013 regarded as their worst tournament performance since the 1938 World Cup \u2013 turned out to be a necessary evil. They needed to hit rock bottom to accept that a comprehensive overhaul was required in the German game. It was not just the team who needed reconstruction but the entire infrastructure. New football schools were introduced and there was an emphasis on young coaches to teach young players. And so the rejuvenation began. They knew it would take them roughly a decade for the seeds they planted in 2000 to bear fruit and the revolution that began then is clearly bearing fruit. It is interesting that the current Germany team, who have negotiated their group of death without encountering so much as a scratch, have not even needed to use the talented youngsters like Mario G\u00f6tze and Marco Reus for a single minute so far \u2013 another indication of Germany&apos;s rude health. In 2000, Germany wanted to take their lead from the French, who were the trendsetters when it came to reconstruction. France had endured their own shock which sent them back to the drawing board when they failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, and they at the time took some inspiration from the Netherlands, where a young Ajax team were beginning to make extraordinary waves. Today, Holland are bolting home, stunned by an embarrassment bad enough to make them rethink how they should go about rehabilitating themselves. The KNVB said even before the team slumped against Portugal, outwitted and outfought for the third successive game, that Bert van Marwijk&apos;s position would be under review at the end of this campaign. It looks like curtains for the Dutch coach. There was a moment just after Cristiano Ronaldo&apos;s winning goal when the cameras homed in on Van Marwijk and he just looked helpless. He could not summon any visible anger, frustration or even sadness. His face began to twitch, as if the pressure of containing his emotions could not quite be\u00a0kept in. He looked like a man who knew his time was up. Whether a change of management is enough is the question the Dutch have to answer and fairly quickly, too. Qualification for the 2014 World Cup begins in September when Turkey visit the Amsterdam Arena and there are a cluster of established players whose performances, and behaviour, must also be under consideration. All those over 30 must be wondering what lies in store and while the likes of Robin van Persie and Rafael van der Vaart are still in their late 20s, it was not a happy tournament for either of them. The question of how they fit into a balanced starting XI remains complicated while the Oranje stay fixed on their traditional tactics. Waiting in the wings are some youngsters, with the defender Jeffrey Bruma, the midfielder Kevin Strootman, and the playmaker Adam Maher pushing to be included. Some new faces, who are not tarred with the slap-in-the-face disillusionment of this failed campaign, will be a start. Then they can look at the bigger picture. Holland were the ground-breakers, the original thinkers, when it came to youth development but somewhere along the line they have lost their touch since the last golden generation who came painfully close, particularly in the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, an era which included Edwin van der Sar, the De Boer brothers, Jaap Stam, Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Marc Overmars, Patrick Kluivert and Dennis Bergkamp. And remember, these were teams whose results were considered to be poor enough (both lost in the semi-finals on penalties) for the coach to go immediately. Van der Sar declared himself &quot;in shock&quot; after watching the efforts of his compatriots in Ukraine. &quot;We had it coming. It was seen in the buildup to the tournament. We were missing one or two players, some just returning from injury. Then during the tournament different parts of the team didn&apos;t function together. It&apos;s a disappointing result for us after what has been achieved in the past few years.&quot; The inquest begins. Now the powers that be in Dutch football must establish whether Euro 2012 goes down as a washout, or a watershed.", "sentences": ["Qualification for the 2014 World Cup begins in September when Turkey visit the Amsterdam Arena and there are a cluster of established players whose performances, and behaviour, must also be under consideration."], "title": "Euro 2012: Holland's humiliation a washout \u2013 or a watershed? | Amy Lawrence", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jun/18/euro-2012-holland-humiliation-watershed", "tags": ["Holland", "Euro 2012", "Euro 2012 Group B", "Germany", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-18T17:50:49Z", "article": "     Reading this on mobile?

But Nick Prueher, co-host of the comedy sensation Found Footage festival, begs to differ. &quot;I have a feeling,&quot; he says, &quot;that stupid videos might be the international language. I\u00a0think this stuff will translate well.&quot; He&apos;d better hope so: &quot;this stuff&quot; is the hours&apos; worth of discarded VHS footage he and partner Joe Pickett have reclaimed from charity shops and car-boot sales across the US. And now it&apos;s coming to the UK, as part of the format&apos;s first international tour. So brace yourself for Winnebago Man, a mobile-home salesman turning the air blue as he continually fluffs his lines while making a series of 1980s corporate videos. Or Rent-a-Friend, a character from the early days of VHS who embarks on a doomed bid to make conversation with whoever is watching. There are junior school talent shows and penis-pump videos, terrifying health-and-safety instructionals and Texan furniture commercials. &quot;Whatever the video is trying to do,&quot; says Prueher, &quot;all we ask is that it fail in\u00a0an entertaining way.&quot;            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Prueher and Pickett set up the Found Footage festival in 2004, to raise money for a documentary they were making, Dirty Country, about a smutty country singer. Prueher was then a producer on The Late Show with David Letterman, where &quot;part of my job was to track down embarrassing old footage of celebrities and actors&quot;. He and Pickett were already old video buffs: &quot;We grew up together in a small town in the midwest where there wasn&apos;t a lot going on. Out of boredom, we started finding and showing these videos to one another, and even now it\u00a0still seems like an inside joke.&quot; Since going public, Pickett and Prueher have performed FFF at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal, screened 36 episodes of a TV version on the satirical news website the Onion (for which Pickett writes), and released four DVDs. The show&apos;s success, says Prueher, is due in part to nostalgia for the 1980s and 90s, high watermarks of VHS. And despite concerns that, after eight years&apos; scavenging, they may be running out of cast-off videos to rediscover, he won&apos;t countenance opening up the show to digital footage. &quot;Because the VHS format was new and accessible, you had a lot of people who probably didn&apos;t have that much business behind a camera, or in front of it, making tapes. People didn&apos;t know what was going to stick, so they just threw ideas against a wall and tried things out.&quot; That&apos;s where Rent-a-Friend comes in. &quot;There&apos;s this guy sitting in a living room going, &apos;Hi, my name&apos;s Sam, what&apos;s your name?&apos; Then there&apos;s a pause and you&apos;re supposed to suspend your disbelief and answer.&quot; Prueher doesn&apos;t sound impressed. &quot;It probably seemed like a good idea at the time.&quot; The shows also feature wry commentaries from the co-hosts, and updated &quot;Where are they now?&quot; footage. Remarkably, no subject has taken umbrage at their unsolicited inclusion, although it&apos;s been a close call. Winnebago Man \u2013 real name Jack Rebney \u2013 was traced by a documentary maker and invited to one of Pickett and Prueher&apos;s events. &quot;When he found out this footage was doing the rounds, he was pretty pissed off,&quot; says Prueher. But by the end of the show, &quot;as he saw people doubled over in laughter, you could see a smile come over his face&quot;.

It was while he was giving his brilliantly articulated and hilarious &quot;turn&quot; as the gobbledegook-shouting drill sergeant in Oh, What a Lovely War! in the West End in 1963 \u2013 he won a Tony for the performance when the show went to Broadway \u2013 that the Beatles visited him backstage and invited him to\u00a0appear in A Hard Day&apos;s Night (1964). George Harrison later said that his mother would refuse to go and see the group&apos;s films unless Spinetti was in them. These, and other tales of the stars, would be recounted by Spinetti himself in his one-man shows, and in the wonderful autobiography he wrote, Up Front (2006), with the help of another Littlewood associate, Peter Rankin. &quot;The people I miss most are all in the show,&quot; Spinetti told me over lunch four years ago, &quot;so I don&apos;t miss them at\u00a0all, really. It&apos;s like a seance, and there they all are, No\u00ebl and Marlene, Frank, Joan and Tennessee. Tenn came to see me in a play that was a disaster. &apos;Victor,&apos; he\u00a0said, &apos;I&apos;ll see you in anything. But\u00a0don&apos;t be in this again.&apos;&quot; Spinetti was the eldest of six children, born in the mining village of Cwm in the Ebbw Vale. His father, Giuseppe, who ran a fish and chip shop, was interned on the Isle of Man when the second world war broke out. Spinetti was educated at Monmouth school, then became embroiled in amateur dramatics and was discharged from his national service, and a TB ward, in 1948 with a\u00a0pleural effusion. He then attended the Cardiff School of Music and Drama where he met his partner, the actor Graham Curnow (who died in 1997). They shared a house, and an openly non-monogamous life, thereafter. Spinetti&apos;s grounding in show business was both louche and demanding: a\u00a0Welsh concert party, revues, variety theatres, US air force bases and hotel functions. He made his London debut in Expresso Bongo (1958) by Wolf Mankowitz and Julian More at the Saville theatre. Paul Scofield was the star in this satire on the entertainment industry, but a multitasking Spinetti made a comic mark as a Fleet Street editor, a parson, a\u00a0psychiatrist and a head waiter. He was more than ready for the swinging 60s, living a champagne lifestyle and dressing colourfully, even\u00a0when he could not pay all the bills. And if that happened, he told me, he\u00a0&quot;spanked old gentlemen for money&quot; so he could buy Christmas presents. &quot;My dear old mother told me that, if she&apos;d known at\u00a0the time, she would have come along and given me a hand!&quot; Littlewood snapped him up at Stratford East, where his association, in a great company including Barbara Windsor, Harry H Corbett, Avis Bunnage, George A Cooper and Murray Melvin, stretched from 1959 to 1965. This was a golden age in British theatre, running in parallel with first stirrings at\u00a0the Royal Shakespeare Company and\u00a0the National theatre. He appeared as Brain-Worm in Ben Jonson&apos;s Every Man in His Humour, as\u00a0an IRA officer in Brendan Behan&apos;s The\u00a0Hostage (which he also played in New York), and as Tosh in Frank Norman and Lionel Bart&apos;s Fings Ain&apos;t Wot They Used T&apos;Be with Windsor before Lovely War took him back into the West End. After his New York success and the first two Beatles films \u2013 Richard Lester&apos;s Help! followed A Hard Day&apos;s Night in\u00a01965 \u2013 he played opposite Jack Klugman in Neil Simon&apos;s The Odd Couple at the Queen&apos;s in 1966 and then accepted an invitation from the critic Kenneth Tynan to co-write and direct John Lennon&apos;s zany, poetic In His Own Write at the National (then based at the Old Vic) in 1968. His career after this phenomenal start was erratic. He clocked up more than 30 films, including the third Beatles collaboration, Magical Mystery Tour (1967) for television, and Andrew Sinclair&apos;s Under Milk Wood (1972) with the Burtons again, as well as Peter O&apos;Toole, Si\u00e2n Phillips and Vivien\u00a0Merchant. Spinetti was always in work but there was not much focus to it. He started directing musicals in the 1970s, taking charge of Hair in Amsterdam and Rome, and Jesus Christ Superstar in Paris. In\u00a01980 he directed The Biograph Girl, a\u00a0mediocre musical about the silent movie era at the Phoenix theatre, London, and shortly afterwards launched his one-man show of tart and\u00a0funny reminiscences, A Very Private Diary, at the Edinburgh festival, but only on the fringe. A season with the RSC at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1995 was not a happy experience (&quot;we were called by page numbers and I didn&apos;t know the names of\u00a0the people I was on stage with&quot;) but\u00a0he delivered superb performances as Lord Foppington in John Vanbrugh&apos;s The Relapse and as a composite of\u00a0cardinals opposite David Troughton&apos;s four-square Richard III. Later film work included a nice cameo in Peter Medak&apos;s The Krays (1990). On\u00a0television he played in an early sitcom opposite Sid James, Two in Clover, but became even better known as a Mexican snack thief in adverts for McVitie&apos;s Jaffa cakes. In the 1980s he was the voice of Texas Pete in the children&apos;s series SuperTed, and 10 years ago played the &quot;man of a thousand faces&quot; in the popular children&apos;s show Harry and the Wrinklies. His last on-screen appearance was in\u00a0a recent DVD of an independent film, Seth Swirsky&apos;s Beatles Stories, issued to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Beatles&apos; first recording session at Abbey Road. And on stage he last garnered acclaim as Einstein in Albert&apos;s Boy at the Finborough theatre in Earl&apos;s Court in 2005. There he was, taking an audience by surprise right to the end. \u2022 Vittorio (Victor) Giorgio Andrea Spinetti, actor, born 2 September 1929; died 18 June 2012 \u2022  This article was amended on 22 June 2012.

AKQA, founded in 2001 by UK entrepreneur Ajaz Ahmed, is one of the few global independent advertising agencies that so far resisted being snapped up by one of the major marketing services giants. WPP has taken an undisclosed majority stake in AKQA, giving the deal an enterprise value of about $540m (\u00a3348m). The deal is arguably the most significant in the digital advertising market since WPP&apos;s rival, Maurice L\u00e9vy&apos;s Publicis, bought Razorfish for $530m in 2009. General Atlantic owned an 80% stake in AKQA, with the remainder held by management. Bedecarre and Ahmed were the largest management shareholders. WPP has bought General Atlantic&apos;s stake \u2014 which means the company made about $430m, a healthy profit on the $250m to $300m it paid for the 80% in 2007 \u2014 and an undisclosed amount of the 20% AKQA management stake. Ahmed and Bedecarre will remain shareholders in the business. The AKQA deal is largest aquisition for WPP since the \u00a31.1bn paid for TNS in 2008. The $42m forecast for AKQA&apos;s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation this year means WPP paid a multiple of 12.8 times for the $540m deal. &quot;We are looking forward to working with Ajaz and Tom to broaden their offer and our own, both geographically and functionally,&quot; said Sorrell, WPP&apos;s chief executive. &quot;We are delighted to be united.&quot; Ahmed and Tom Bedecarre, the chairman of AKQA, resisted a $600m (\u00a3383m) bid for the company from Japanese advertising giant Dentsu in 2010. The pair own about 10% of the business and at the time opposed a sale, which was being pushed by General Atlantic, the Connecticut private equity firm. General Atlantic took a majority stake in AKQA in 2007 for reportedly between $200m and $250m. AKQA was founded by Ahmed in his early 20s and now has offices in London, New York, Washington DC, Shanghai, Berlin and Amsterdam and employs 1,160 staff. Revenues were $189m in 2011 and are forecast to be $230m this year. Bedecarre will also take the role of president of WPP Ventures, a new Silicon Valley-based company, which will aim to make more digital investments. Sorrell said that there are few other targets out there like AKQA, perhaps the publicly listed LBi. But he added that LBi is a &quot;roll-up&quot; of a number of businesses over the years, which arguably makes it less attractive. &quot;AKQA is strongly developed and built organically, a double whammy,&quot; he told MediaGuardian.

Here are her exclusive answers, as part of her week-long Guardian digital takeover. RichieM1 asked:  I read somewhere a quote from John Lennon that described you as &quot;the world&apos;s most famous unknown artist: everybody knows her name, but nobody knows what she does.&quot;  For those people who this remains to be the case and/or still cannot detach you from the break up of the Beatles, how would you best describe what it is you do?  Peace and Love!  Yoko answers \u2026 If anybody feels better by thinking of me as a negative force - bless them. SeaSpleen asked:  What bands today are the most interesting to you \u2013 music is subjective, but, I&apos;d like to know what you think. Who are some of the most innovative artists, sound and/or visual to you today, 2012?  Yoko answers \u2026 All musicians are trying to do what they can do. Even the ones who don&apos;t know that they are trying can give us peace and love by their creation. The opposite will be to create weapons, violence and war. SeaSpleen asked:  What, in your view are long-term ramifications of the &apos;69 Bed-In over Amsterdam/Montreal?  Yoko answers \u2026 I am eternally thankful for any positive effect we had through what we did. tomcasagranda asked:  Yoko,  Hi - What was it like working with Ornette Coleman ?  Secondly, what happened to the Fluxus Movement ?  Thirdly, did you ever meet members of the B-52&apos;s, as they were huge fans of your music ?  Finally, I love Elvis Costello&apos;s cover of Walking On Thin Ice: do you have any favourite cover versions of Yoko Ono tunes?  Yoko answers \u2026  1) Ornette was very gentle and let me do what I wanted. 2) Fluxus is still going! 3) Members of the B52s are very good friends now. 4) Elvis&apos; cover is very, very hip. I love it. The others were all very good too. But Elvis&apos; one shines brightest. lesoy asked:  How has being Japanese influenced your work?  Yoko answers \u2026 I learnt resilience and caring details. semitone asked:  I&apos;m interested in what you think of the state of art education at the moment. Do you think it is still important for artists to learn skills like drawing, painting and sculpture? Do you think tertiary art colleges have the balance right between teaching theory and concepts and teaching practical skills? And where do you think the next Lucian Freud \u2013 surely the greatest figurative painter of his generation \u2013 is going to come from, given that most &quot;celebrity&quot; artists working today are doing mainly conceptual art?  Yoko answers \u2026  What will happen will happen. People will try something else if they are stuck in conceptual art. Art is action \u2013 so don&apos;t worry. kleemo asked:  Yoko, after all those years, is &apos;Yes&apos; still the answer?  And also, isn&apos;t Oh Yoko the loveliest song by John Lennon? (it&apos;s my favourite \u2026)  Jo\u00eblle.  Yoko answers \u2026  Thank you, Jo\u00eblle. I also think Oh Yoko is a very lovely song. The answer is still &quot;YES.&quot; Do you want to say &quot;NO&quot; and sink together? Shimo asked:  Ms. Ono,  Living in Japan, I know that here you are treated with a lot more respect. I have also been told that when you communicate in Japanese you speak in a very formal and measured fashion. As a language teacher I wondered whether you would agree that perhaps the difference in public perception of you in the English/Japanese speaking cultures stems in part from the way that you speak, and differences in what you say in the two languages. Would you even agree that you are perceived differently?  Yoko answers \u2026  I am perceived differently in each country, I suppose. But that is alright. They should perceive me in the way they want to. Tessmadaboutmusic asked:  Hi Yoko,  Have you ever thought of exhibiting in Dublin? I&apos;d love to see your work  Yoko answers \u2026  Well, let&apos;s see \u2026 ghostoftomjoad asked:  Who was the first artist who interested/inspired you and why?  Yoko answers \u2026  Myself. pomodo asked:  As an artist, and someone who has spent a fair amount of time in Japan, I&apos;ve always recognised a certain \u2013 for lack of a better term \u2013 Japanese-ness, or zen sensibility, to your work that also seemed a comfortable fit within the Fluxus project. Certainly other associated artists \u2013 John cage or Nam June Pik, for example \u2013 had been influenced by eastern thought in their conceptual approach to their practices; yet, generally, they were working within the context of a largely western art world or audience. I guess I&apos;m wondering if you ever feel the work is received differently in Japan, where it may resonate with people on this kind of deeper cultural level, vs western audiences, where it comes through the filter of Fluxus, neo-Dada, or 20th-century &quot;conceptual art.&quot;  Yoko answers \u2026  I like the different way the work is perceived. More power to the difference. Let&apos;s not try to unify it. prosepixie asked:  You&apos;ve inspired generations around the world, and whatever else people say you have made an indelible mark on cultural history. What&apos;s the key to being happy?  PS I think you are a brave person for doing this. Thanks for inviting us to ask questions.  Yoko answers \u2026  Sometimes I am happy and sometimes not. I am after all a human being, you know. And I am glad that we are sometimes happy and sometimes not. You get your wisdom working by having different emotions. MiddleClassHero asked:  Dear Yoko  As an artist, what is your opinion of the current art world? Do you think that there is a lack of great art being produced, or just that the great artists aren&apos;t getting the attention they deserve?  Yoko answers \u2026  Great Art is Great because it inspired you greatly. If it didn&apos;t, no matter what the critics, the museums and the galleries say, it&apos;s not great art for you. maryjolene asked:  I love the piece SKY TV 1966, where the sky outside the gallery is filmed and simultaneously shown on a small TV/monitor within the gallery. How important is the scale of the TV screen in relation to the idea?  Yoko answers \u2026  It was the TV I was inspired to bring in to the room, when my low rent apartment did not have any windows. I like to stick to the size of that TV as much as possible. Writing on Facebook, Kiyomi Louet says:  I want to ask her how she thinks we can solve deprivation and poverty in developed countries  Yoko answers \u2026  I think things will change for the better if we start to be kind and thoughtful to each other.", "sentences": ["SeaSpleen asked:  What, in your view are long-term ramifications of the &apos;69 Bed-In over Amsterdam/Montreal?"], "title": "Yoko Ono answers your questions", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jun/20/yoko-ono-answers-your-questions", "tags": ["Yoko Ono", "Art", "Art and design", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-21T12:00:55Z", "article": "     Reading this on mobile?

By 2050, the world&apos;s population will have grown to nine billion, but with increases in flooding globally and more frequent, long lasting droughts, the ecosystem is becoming increasingly strained. How can the world adapt to create a more sustainable and secure food system using less resources? Changing behaviour According to Forum for the Future, 30% to 50% of all food grown worldwide may be lost or wasted before or after it reaches the consumer. Addressing this disconnect between the food on people&apos;s forks and its origins is crucial. What will change people&apos;s attitudes so they value what they eat in a way that is beneficial to the entire food system? As Oliver Balch writes in his recent blog, brands have a role to play in shifting consumer behaviour. Initiatives from companies such as Max Burger, who cite the carbon emissions of some meals on its menus, are a good starting point for creating shifts in behaviour. There is also the debate over choice editing, where retailers remove products that are harmful to the environment from their shelves. Could simply removing environmentally or socially harmful products, or including externalised risks such as resource depletion or loss of biodiversity within the price of the product, encourage consumers to make better choices? As Professor Ian Roberts, director of the Clinical Trials Unit at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, highlighted on BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme, obesity is also playing a role in the current food crisis. Roberts argues that due to the obesity problem in developed countries such as the US, body mass must be considered in the debate. &quot;If every country becomes as fat as the US, and that&apos;s the kind of trajectory we&apos;re on, then in mass terms it&apos;s like having an extra billion people on the Earth or in food energy terms it&apos;s like feeding another half a billion,&quot; says Roberts. So rather than just looking at population size, should we be considering the amount of flesh there is on the planet as well? Innovative and efficient farming Alongside a shift in consumption, the world must be more efficient in producing food. Whilst demand is growing, the availability of key resources, such as water and productive land, is decreasing. As Mark Driscoll, head of One Planet Food Programme at WWF, says: &quot;We haven&apos;t got any more land, so we have to produce more from the same amount of land, without as many environmental impacts.&quot; There are various ways of creating more effective and efficient farming systems. Technology will have its part to play with &quot;climate resistant&quot; crops being developed albeit to much contention. Sharing best practice, particularly among producers in the developing world, helps cut out inefficiencies whilst better communication of the latest seed types and irrigation techniques has also increase in yields. But how can scale and pace be reached in these efforts? From production through to consumption, things must change. How can we ensure the world&apos;s population will have enough to eat in 2050?

It was 28 November 1995, around a\u00a0year after the release of a disappointing album titled Second Coming. I had been sent to interview them for Q magazine. Behind the scenes, what I most recall is the absence of anything suggestive of success. They were billeted to a shabby seafront hotel; one of my clearest memories is of singer Ian Brown trying\u00a0to cadge 20p to use an\u00a0ancient payphone. I\u00a0saw the whole group together twice: during the 90\u00a0minutes when they were onstage, and for a testy 15-minute photoshoot on\u00a0the beach that took two hours to organise. &quot;It&apos;s not all hunky-dory in Rosesworld,&quot; guitarist John Squire told me. Within a year, they had split up, in\u00a0a\u00a0cloud of acrimony and spite. But now look. Over three nights next weekend, 225,000 people will swarm to Heaton Park in Manchester, to see the original lineup, all of whom are close to their 50th birthdays. The crowds, by contrast, are likely to be of\u00a0all\u00a0ages: some set on reliving a brief moment from their youth, others drawn\u00a0not so much to a rock band, as a\u00a0myth that has ballooned during the 22\u00a0years since the four of them last performed in the UK. Yet consider a few inescapable facts. The band&apos;s peak came in 1990. They released only two albums: one very good, the other very patchy. And Brown&apos;s vocals remain as erratic as ever: one Observer critic was recently moved to celebrate one song in which he had hit &quot;every single note perfectly&quot; \u2013 which made him sound more like a contestant from The X\u00a0Factor than a man charging people \u00a355 to hear his group. So far, the reformed Stone Roses have\u00a0played concerts in Spain, Holland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany \u2013 and the shakily shot mobile-phone footage posted on YouTube suggests age and experience have eaten away at the mystique that tends to ebb away as musicians get older. Around a fortnight ago, online films recorded a much-reported episode at Amsterdam&apos;s Heineken Music Hall, when drummer Alan &quot;Reni&quot; Wren failed to return for the encores, and a solitary Brown came back on to the stage. With all the elegance of a grumpy MC at a British Legion club, he said: &quot;The drummer&apos;s gone home. I&apos;m not joking \u2026 Get all your aggro out on me, I can take it. What can I say? The drummer&apos;s a cunt.&quot; It is a reccurring theme in the Stone Roses&apos; almost 30-year history: discord, anticlimax, and occasional outbreaks of farce. For the most successful phase of their career, their manager \u2013 one Gareth Evans \u2013 was a former hairdresser who knew almost nothing about the music business, and signed them to one of the most iniquitous recording contracts in history (his legal adviser was a mortgage specialist from the Mancunian suburb of Sale). When they extracted themselves from its demands via the high court and disappeared from view, it was easy to think they had gone to one of those shadowy places into which rock legends occasionally disappear (American rehab facilities, castles in Ireland), but the reality was more prosaic: between 1991 and 1994 they were working on new music in a converted working men&apos;s club in Tintwistle, Derbyshire. Their comeback in the mid-90s was meant to be crowned by a headline appearance at Glastonbury in 1995 \u2013 but it was pulled when Squire fell off his bike. Even the most celebrated episode in their career was plagued by mishap and bad management. On 27 May 1990, they played to 30,000 people at Spike Island, a reclaimed toxic-waste site near Widnes, in Cheshire. I was there: aged 20, and dressed in the obligatory baggy uniform of the time \u2013 impossibly wide jeans, an equally voluminous denim shirt, and red Kickers shoes (&quot;You look like a clown,&quot; said my mother). That day, I thought I had experienced the time of my life: the Independent On Sunday called it &quot;the Woodstock of a new generation&quot;, and despite all kinds of privations, my friends and I thought that was roughly what had happened. In hindsight, it was a fiasco. The queues for the bars were impossibly long. The support acts were largely awful. By the early evening, all I could think of was how much I needed a wee, and how long it would be before the Roses appeared. When they finally emerged, the sound was so blown around by the wind they were sometimes all but inaudible. On the way out, the 30,000 people present were herded across a series of narrow bridges \u2013 at one point, as a frightening bottleneck took hold, the section in which I found myself began a spontaneous chant of\u00a0&quot;Hillsborough! Hillsborough!&quot;. Most of this has been lost to history. A\u00a0film titled Spike Island is now in production, built around a fictional band who make their way to the event without tickets, and have some kind of epiphany. The advance blurb talks about &quot;the gig of the decade&quot;, and its director, Chris Coghill, has promised a &quot;love letter to the Stone Roses and to Manchester in 1990&quot;. Modern Britain is in need of myths and legends \u2013 and no matter how badly they messed up last time, the Stone Roses can help. And here, I think, is why. They made some great music, a lot of it crammed on to their first album, which is not quite the Best Record Ever Made that some overexcited people have claimed, but certainly one of the most perfectly realised British albums of the past 30\u00a0years. Moreover, their best songs embody a time when musical and political orthodoxies were changing at\u00a0speed, and a lot of people felt suddenly liberated. The Berlin Wall was about to come down, Mrs Thatcher would soon be gone, and the spread of ecstasy gave pop\u00a0music a new mood of stampeding optimism. &quot;Kiss me where the sun don&apos;t\u00a0shine/The past was yours, but the\u00a0future&apos;s mine&quot; went She Bangs the\u00a0Drums \u2013 which may have been standard-issue braggadocio, but sounded like a group in tune with how\u00a0fast things seemed to be changing. Since getting back together, Squire and Brown have again been writing songs, and the band have signed two big\u00a0record deals: the only description of new material that has done the rounds is of &quot;psychedelic pop songs&quot;, which does not sound too different from their speciality last time. The difference will be not just how much they themselves have changed, but the fact that the things that made their music so resonant are part of a distant past. Not that it counts for much, but that&apos;s one reason I&apos;m not minded to see them play this time round. That, and the\u00a0fact that I have had a peek behind the curtain. The day of the Bridlington gig, I\u00a0was finally ushered into a backstage canteen area to interview Brown, bassist Gary &quot;Mani&quot; Mounfield and new drummer Robbie Maddix. Brown was wearing an oversized fleece, tracksuit bottoms and one of those winter hats, complete with ear-flaps, that makes anyone who wears them look completely ridiculous. His skin looked grey; compared to the person who had stared from magazine covers five years before, he seemed to have somehow collapsed in on himself. And he was in no mood to be interviewed, not least because I had reviewed his band&apos;s second album in the NME and given it a mere six out of ten. For some reason, he was carrying one of\u00a0those novelty harmonicas set into a big plastic banana. Every time I asked a question, he would blow into his banana and shoot me a look. At one point, he jumped up from his seat and, with no little malice, tried to push me out of the room. I know why I didn&apos;t walk out: not only did I have to deliver a 3,000-word feature, but I was 25, and still in awe of a group who had soundtracked my youth. And this was my reward: truculence and\u00a0borderline bullying. Squire, by contrast, was charm personified. He requested a solo interview, and we met the following morning. He was candid about the impasse the band had reached at their peak \u2013 when, for keeps, they became not just a band, but the signifier of an entire cultural moment: &quot;I felt like we were flogging something for somebody, but I\u00a0didn&apos;t know what it was or who they were. A\u00a0lifestyle, I suppose. An attitude.&quot; With\u00a0a knowing laugh, he said the precedent-setting court case that extracted them from their first record contract was &quot;probably a greater contribution to popular music than anything we&apos;ve recorded.&quot; I talked to him again six years later, after he had stepped back from music to\u00a0concentrate on being a painter and sculptor (Squire designed all the band&apos;s record sleeves; his Pollock-esque abstracts have long since worked as a series of de facto logos). Sitting around the kitchen table of his home-cum-studio on the edge of the Peak District, we discussed Second Coming, the album whose interminable gestation caused irreparable damage to the band, and had done for his friendship with Brown in particular. &quot;Ian smoked too much dope,&quot; he told me. &quot;When he was stoned, he was at best a tuneless knob, and at worst a paranoid mess.&quot; If that seemed mean-spirited, it was a\u00a0belated riposte to years of slights from his old colleague, about Squire&apos;s use of cocaine, and how upset Brown had been by his departure. (&quot;He left me to sink or swim, simple as that,&quot; said the singer. &quot;He didn&apos;t give a fuck&quot;). The poisoned divide between them remained for more\u00a0than a decade, and the idea of any reconciliation \u2013 let alone a band reunion \u2013 seemed slim. In March 2009, there were rumours of a comeback tour, which led Squire to produce an artwork based around the words: &quot;I have no desire whatsoever to desecrate the grave of seminal Manchester pop group The Stone Roses.&quot; As with the Smiths and the Jam, it looked as if they would leave the snowballing craze for reunions well alone, which seemed all to the good, particularly in the case of a group with such a record of haphazardly damaging their own magic. But now, after Squire and Brown met at Mounfield&apos;s mother&apos;s funeral and repaired their relationship, they are back: their legend has grown in absentia, but how can they live\u00a0up to it, not least as men with an average age of 48.75? Fair play to them, perhaps: in the wake of a career so ruined by accident and ineptitude, during which endless thousands seemed to fall through their fingers, it would be churlish to begrudge them the chance to finally have a go at doing things properly, and make a load of money in the process. The bigger question is why so many people want to see them, though in the handbills for the other summer events where they&apos;ll be appearing \u2013 T in the Park, the V Festivals \u2013 there lurk all kinds of answers. Other headliners include Snow Patrol, the Vaccines and\u00a0the Maccabees, who will turn up, do\u00a0their thing with tedious proficiency and go blankly on their way. In other words, it falls to four men at the tail-end of their 40s to remind modern audiences of the tightrope walk that once lay between triumph and disaster, and why even in the midst of a talent for\u00a0self-sabotage, an elusive something can still burn through. That&apos;s the highfalutin theory, anyway. The more prosaic truth may be that in times as grim as these, thousands of people will happily pretend that the last 20 years have been rolled back, and that if only for a couple of hours, they can be back in 1990 \u2013 happily looking to a future which, for the Stone Roses as much as anyone, singularly failed to happen.", "sentences": ["Around a fortnight ago, online films recorded a much-reported episode at Amsterdam&apos;s Heineken Music Hall, when drummer Alan &quot;Reni&quot; Wren failed to return for the encores, and a solitary Brown came back on to the stage."], "title": "Why I won't be going to see the Stone Roses, by John Harris", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/23/i-wont-see-stone-roses", "tags": ["Stone Roses", "Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-23T23:04:09Z", "article": "Who would be in a band? In rock, most narrative arcs end badly. Break-up, breakdown, death and dishonour are the results artists can usually hope for. If musicians are lucky, the ignominy will be cushioned by a luxuriant mattress of acclaim. If they are very lucky indeed, there will also be the warm duvet of cash. Most bands get neither. Mancunian dreamers the Stone Roses very nearly foundered on bad deals before being rescued by the Geffen label, making a flawed second album and bitterly unravelling, feeding\u00a0one of British pop music&apos;s most fertile legends. Before their current reunion tacked a new chapter on to a cautionary tale, the Stone Roses came to a miserable stop in 1996 at the Reading festival. Half the classic line-up weren&apos;t even there \u2013 no Alan &quot;Reni&quot; Wren on drums, no John Squire on guitar. I was one of the thousands of fans who walked away in disgust at the thudding and caterwauling that constituted the band&apos;s appearance. It was a dreadful coda to a dream in which the Stone Roses \u2013 cleverer, better-looking and more musically sophisticated than the Happy Mondays \u2013 helmed a revival in British music where the haziness of the 60s lent a beatific air to the ecstasy-driven revolutions spilling out of dance music and into the wider culture. Some cried that night, some jeered; most of us made our way to see Underworld in the dance tent. Anything would have been better than listening to the rump Roses sound, while pyres of plastic beer cups filled the air with substances less noxious. It is little surprise that the band&apos;s current long-awaited European tour has already been marred by squabbles. Singer Ian Brown called Reni a &quot;cunt&quot; on stage in Amsterdam. The question now is no longer whether will they record any decent new material, but will they last until their Manchester dates at the end of June. As one of British rock&apos;s great lessons in how not to run your affairs, the Roses are no strangers to extensive retrospectives in the rock monthlies. Journalist John Robb&apos;s is the most notable biography. Former Roses tour manager Steve &quot;Adge&quot; Atherton is rumoured to be writing his own book; his testimony is absent here, as are direct interviews with Brown, Squire and bassist Gary &quot;Mani&quot; Mounfield. The Stone Roses: War and Peace sets out to hymn the Roses and tut at their industry tribulations once again, this time with great access to Reni, the band&apos;s funky drummer, a reclusive figure who\u00a0remains pivotal to their sound. Legions of old bandmates are called upon to chart the band&apos;s beginnings, in fascinating opposition to Factory Records and Tony Wilson&apos;s monopoly on the Mancunian scene. And while there is not much sense of the band&apos;s inner artistic motivations, War and Peace is rich with\u00a0context and who\u00a0didn&apos;t pay what to whom. Author Simon Spence used to be called Simon Dudfield, and, as Madchester took hold, he was writing for NME and the Face. He was at the band&apos;s era-defining Spike Island gig, he saw them at London&apos;s Alexandra Palace, and he recounts the expansion and contraction of each of the band&apos;s flare measurements with great acuity. At one point in 1989, Ian Brown goes down from 24-inch flares &quot;for that slight swish&quot; to a more manageable 21 inches (p139). In the absence of three of its stars, the secondary research does the heavy lifting. War and Peace really comes into its own as an almost wonkish account of the ludicrous business practices that derailed the Roses. Bogged down in legal battles, they never recovered the momentum of their classic first album and its slinky standalone follow-up single, Fools Gold. Their second album, The Second Coming, never regained what time and court battles had sapped from the foursome. To his credit, Spence has kept the company of lawyers and former record company bosses to explain in forensic detail exactly how dreadful the deals struck by the band&apos;s management were. The view from the American industry is particularly illuminating. The Roses famously never broke America, partly by design, partly by default. Gareth Evans, their larger-than-life manager, demanded their first gig be at Shea Stadium. Tours were booked, then cancelled. To one romantic view, the Roses were creative lions led by incompetent, venal donkeys. Spence, for his part, also acknowledges the part the musicians&apos; personalities played in their plight. They didn&apos;t read the small print; factionalisation got in the way of an equal split. Their sense of the grand gesture frequently defied good sense. According to one former lawyer, John Kennedy, one US label wanted to sign the band on Concorde. The band were keen to board the flight, then, halfway across the Atlantic, refused to sign. (The deal never happened.) Just as his portentous title clunks slightly, Spence&apos;s transparent fandom can let his good material down. &quot;The set list was now shorn of all their aggressive early material and packed with definitive masterpieces&quot; is the kind of writing you hope not to read in a grown-up music book. As the feted ghostwriter of Andrew Loog Oldham&apos;s memoirs, 2Stoned, one of Spence&apos;s claims comes as a serious shock. &quot;[Michael] Jackson had DiLeo, the Stones had Andrew Loog Oldham, the Pistols had Malcolm McLaren \u2013 and the Stone Roses would have Gareth Evans. Incredibly, given the competition, history would judge Evans as the most astonishing band manager of the lot.&quot; Incredibly, indeed, given that wheeler-dealer Evans was instrumental in signing the Roses to Jive/Zomba via de facto indie label Silvertone on contracts that were so skewed against the band even jaded music business lawyers were shocked. Evans himself was on an extortionate 33.3% deal \u2013 a figure substantially less amusing when the band hit trouble than it had been when they laughingly signed up. Even though Spence never interviews him directly, he displays a strange fondness for the former club owner and bullion dealer, prone to peeling notes off a wad that was padded with newspaper. Perhaps Evans&apos;s biography is next.

Expected to be called the Nexus 7, it is forecast to be have a seven-inch diagonal screen and run a new version of Google&apos;s tablet software. But some analysts are sceptical that it will be able to make substantial inroads into Apple&apos;s dominant share. The announcement, expected at its I/O developer conference in California, will pitch Google into battle with Apple, whose iPad dominates sales of tablets \u2013 with almost 70% of the worldwide market in the first quarter of 2012 according to researchers IDC \u2013 and with online retailer Amazon, which sells its Kindle Fire tablet in the US and is expected to bring it to Europe later this year. Rather than tackling the 10in iPad head-on, Google is expected instead to attack the Kindle Fire, which also has a 7in screen. &quot;It&apos;s targeting Amazon,&quot; an executive at Taiwan&apos;s Asus, which is believed to be making the device, told Reuters. &quot;The Kindle is based on Google&apos;s platform but with its own service, so Google has to launch its own service, too.&quot; Online rumours suggest it will be called the Nexus 7 \u2013 which would follow the pattern it has followed with its own-brand smartphones, which have all used the Nexus naming convention, even while being made by other companies such as Samsung and HTC. Industry rumours say the Nexus 7 has been made for Google by Taiwan&apos;s Asus \u2013 a surprising move given that Google last August bid for Motorola Mobility, which made the Xoom tablet. That takeover was completed in May. Google has made repeated efforts to break into the tablet market defined by Apple with the launch of the iPad in January 2010. Its first tablet-only software, Android 3.0 \u2013 known as Honeycomb \u2013 introduced in January 2011 was expected to create challengers to Apple&apos;s product, but fewer than 10m sold in the first year, while the iPad sold more than 38m in 2011. The software giant Microsoft has also indicated that it thinks tablets are of growing importance. Last week it announced that it would be offering its own tablet, called Surface, which will run its next Windows 8 operating system \u2013 though it offered no dates or prices for the release. Windows 8 is expected in the autumn, probably in October. And speaking in Amsterdam on Wednesday, Microsoft corporate vice-president Antoine Leblond forecast that &quot;next year, tablets will outsell desktop [PCs]&quot;. According to the researchers IDC, total tablet sales will be almost 105 this year, and will hit 143m in 2013 \u2013 compared to total PC sales of about 400m, of which more than 60% will be laptops. The Nexus 7 is expected to go on sale later this year, and possibly running an as-yet unreleased version 5.0 of Android, called Jelly Bean, rather than the current 4.0 version, Ice Cream Sandwich. Salman Chaudhry, analyst at the research company Context, said the tablet &quot;must run Jelly Bean rather than Ice Cream Sandwich if Google is looking at creating interest and support from the developer community. Google mobile platforms have already suffered from fragmented operating systems as Google continues to work on standardising both operating system and user interface&quot;. He expects pricing to be &quot;in line&quot; with the Kindle Fire, which sells for $199 in the US \u2013 at which price analysts claim Amazon loses money, which it recoups in profit on books, films and other items bought through it. The Kindle Fire was a hit in the US last Christmas, selling an estimated 2m, but sales since have slowed substantially, according to analyst calculations. Amazon has not given any figures for sales. But Chaudhry said: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t expect it to eat into Kindle Fire share either for a number of reasons. Overall, we shouldn&apos;t expect this particular tablet to take on the iPad despite Google&apos;s efforts to differentiate it. Lessons haven&apos;t been learnt from previous Tablet failures. The 7in tablets \u2013 RIM Playbook, HTC Flyer \u2013 have been by and large unsuccessful, and are only really suitable for content consumption. &quot;Against this backdrop, strategy needs to be more aligned towards the Kindle Fire&apos;s purely &apos;content consumption&apos; orientated device. However, if Google is looking to take a bite out of Amazon&apos;s share, it will find that it&apos;s competing against a much more well-developed entertainment orientated platform with a huge, well organised catalogues of books and media content.&quot; Pricing it close to the Kindle Fire&apos;s $199 in the US would suggest that it was not cutting edge, Chaudhry added: &quot;This might make the iPad even more desirable in the consumer&apos;s eyes. By appealing to a demographic which is already price-conscious, average user spend per device will also be lower than on more high-end tablets such as the iPad.&quot;", "sentences": ["And speaking in Amsterdam on Wednesday, Microsoft corporate vice-president Antoine Leblond forecast that &quot;next year, tablets will outsell desktop [PCs]&quot;."], "title": "Google's tablet expected to take on Apple iPad", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/27/google-tablet-ipad-nexus-7", "tags": ["Google", "Technology", "iPad", "Apple", "Computing", "Tablet computers", "US news", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-27T17:00:04Z", "article": "Tim Vigon won&apos;t be among the 75,000 or so Stone Roses fans cramming into Heaton Park in Manchester tomorrow. That&apos;s not because he couldn&apos;t get a ticket, even though all 225,000 tickets for the three shows the band are playing in their home town over the course of this weekend sold out in just 68 minutes. It&apos;s because he couldn&apos;t wait. Vigon, a 41-year-old whose appetite for music might have been sated by years in artist management \u2013 Bloc Party and the Streets have been among his charges \u2013 instead went to see the Roses in Barcelona on the first stop of their reunion tour, following a semi-secret warm-up in Warrington. &quot;On a personal level, they \u2013 along with the Beatles \u2013 shaped everything I think about music,&quot; Vigon says. &quot;The Stone Roses is how I think a band should be. That shared sense of purpose \u2013 looking like a band, being aspirational, sounding different but timeless, making you feel like you&apos;re witnessing history. Even now they make me feel that.&quot; In a literal sense, those who attend Heaton Park will be witnessing history: the Roses will be playing only material they recorded in the late 80s and early 90s; there has been no official suggestion that their reunion might be an ongoing affair. It&apos;s all very different from how band reunions used to be. Until the advent of filesharing and the systemic failure of the recorded music industry, it was expected that bands who reunited would do so behind new music. When Deep Purple re-formed in 1984, they did so with a new album. When David Gilmour reconstituted Pink Floyd a couple of years later, he had a record to push every time the band went on the road. It didn&apos;t matter that the albums these groups made were rarely a patch on the music that made their name \u2013 they were necessary to justify the tours. Now, though, with reunited bands knowing there is little or no financial gain in putting themselves through the misery of months in the studio together \u2013 the reasons for their original dissolution rarely having been addressed in the meantime \u2013 the easy solution is to simply trot out the greatest hits, count the banknotes, and return to seclusion from one another. Still, picking the right moment to reunite remains an art, and Ted Kessler, the features editor of Q magazine, reckons the Roses have found theirs. He believes their reunion &quot;says a lot about that generation of music fans who have reached a stage in life where they need to reconnect to better times. Oasis are no longer going, so there&apos;s a big northern rock space to fill.&quot; Kessler&apos;s argument is persuasive: there is no huge guitar band to unify the crowds of those who prefer having a pogo to throwing hip-hop shapes, and for all the identification of 80s indie with the fey kids who wouldn&apos;t say boo to a goose, its bigger bands always attracted tough and rowdy crowds. There will be plenty of drunken men with tattoos at Heaton Park this weekend. However, it also neglects the astonishing way the Roses, more than any other band of their generation, captured the imagination of their fans. In part, Vigon says, that was down to &quot;amazing management&quot; \u2013 from their earliest days their tour manager, Steve Adge, would notice regulars in the crowd and would invite them backstage, creating a fierce bond of loyalty among the fans, and giving the band the air of a gang to be part of. He remembers being in the front row of a gig in Shrewsbury at which Adge confiscated his camera, &quot;but he went right up and took a close-up of John Squire onstage and gave it back to me \u2013 such a top gesture, but also genius because that sort of thing made me even more loyal&quot;. By the time they played to 30,000 fans at Spike Island in 1990, they felt like pop&apos;s biggest secret club. That cultlike devotion \u2013 and the sense that the Stone Roses, more than any current guitar band, are capable of capturing lightning in a bottle \u2013 is what has led to the huge ticket sales, to the making of a film about Spike Island, to the reports about any and every event from their gigs so far (when the band&apos;s drummer, Reni, stormed off stage in Amsterdam recently, it became international news). Even so, Kessler says, this may be the rare reunion that lasts longer than it takes to pay off outstanding debts. For a start, the band still have something to prove, having made only one album recognised as a classic (&quot;the second is a dog&quot;): &quot;I think they&apos;ll finish the tour, take a break, then make a record.&quot; The fact that the band have signed a record deal supports this contention. Second, there&apos;s the question of whether they will want to return to the day jobs after the adrenaline rush of playing to huge crowds around Europe. Vigon wasn&apos;t sure what to expect in Barcelona, but quickly shed any doubts. &quot;These shows will enhance the legacy,&quot; he says, &quot;because they&apos;ll remind people that certain combinations of musicians just bring out something beyond the sum of its parts.&quot;", "sentences": ["That cultlike devotion \u2013 and the sense that the Stone Roses, more than any current guitar band, are capable of capturing lightning in a bottle \u2013 is what has led to the huge ticket sales, to the making of a film about Spike Island, to the reports about any and every event from their gigs so far (when the band&apos;s drummer, Reni, stormed off stage in Amsterdam recently, it became international news)."], "title": "Stone Roses reunion weekend sold-out", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/27/stone-roses-manchester-sold-out-reunion", "tags": ["Stone Roses", "Music", "Manchester", "UK news", "Greater Manchester"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-28T11:27:15Z", "article": "The Ross Barlow looks like a traditional canal barge, built 100 years ago to be drawn by a horse, travelling at the same speed as modern diesel engine vessels. However the 18-metre boat is one of the most technically advanced in the world. Silent and greenhouse gas-emission free, it can cruise the canals for at least a week on a minimum of fuel. The brainchild of Prof Rex Harris of Birmingham University&apos;s school of engineering is a hydrogen-powered craft, and this week has been one of the stars of a convention in Birmingham that is bringing together key people in the race to find low-carbon transport fuels for ships. The hydrogen on the Ross Barlow is stored onboard in a large-scale metal hydride storage system, which can handle large amounts of hydrogen at room temperature. The hydrogen is released by decreasing the pressure to feed the barge&apos;s fuel cell (an electric battery, in effect). According to Harris, boats are better placed than cars to run on clean hydrogen because the weight of the heavy tank that stores the fuel is immaterial and can replace ballast. &quot;They are at the cutting edge of the hydrogen fuel revolution,&quot; he says. &quot;It is widely recognised that the world has only a few years to meet the urgent challenges of climate change and oil depletion.&quot; Longer terms aims of the Birmingham University project include the development of a canal-side hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, and to generate hydrogen from renewable sources of electricity on suitable sites throughout the canal network. Elsewhere, two British ferry companies are now developing hybrid hydrogen-powered boats, for the Scottish isles and Bristol, but the biggest practical advances in the nascent technology are coming from mainland European countries. Germany and Greece both have hydrogen fuel cell-driven submarines, Turkish students at Istanbul Technical University have built a ferry, a hydrogen-powered boat cruises the Amsterdam canals and there are advanced plans for ocean-going hydrogen container vessels. The increasing price of diesel fuel, the need to reduce carbon emissions, and the soaring cost for railway electrification is also boosting research into a new breed of hydrogen railway trains. Coincidentally, scientists working on hydrogen trains around the world will also meet in Birmingham next week. The first hydrogen-powered locomotive was built for a mine in Canada in 2002 and in the past 10 years, fuell cell trains have been developed in Taiwan, Japan, South Africa, Spain and Denmark with more others planned for China. The state-owned Spanish railway company has demonstrated a &quot;hydrail tram&quot;, and has announced that it will launch Europe&apos;s first hydrail train later this year.", "sentences": ["Germany and Greece both have hydrogen fuel cell-driven submarines, Turkish students at Istanbul Technical University have built a ferry, a hydrogen-powered boat cruises the Amsterdam canals and there are advanced plans for ocean-going hydrogen container vessels."], "title": "How boat engineering is keeping hydrogen power hopes buoyant", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/jun/28/boat-engineering-hydrogen-power", "tags": ["Hydrogen power", "Energy", "Renewable energy", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-28T14:23:04Z", "article": "It has been repeated over and over that no side has ever won three major tournaments in a row \u2013 which is true so long as you exclude the Olympic Games. That may be reasonable in recent times when it has been an Under-23 tournament with added overage players, or even in the years after the second world war when differing definitions of amateurism gave the Eastern Bloc sides a huge advantage. But in the years up to the second world war, the Olympic Games was at least as serious a tournament as the World Cup. If Spain win the Euro 2012 final on Sunday, they will set a new record for the modern era but their feat will only equal that of Uruguay, who won the Olympics in 1924 and 1928 and the World Cup in 1930, and of Italy, who won the World Cup in 1934 and 1938 and the Olympics in 1936. It is a measure of Spain&apos;s achievement, though, that after Uruguay and Italy only two other sides have ever reached the final of three successive tournaments: West Germany, who won the European Championship in 1972 and the World Cup in 1974 before losing a penalty shootout to Czechoslovakia in the final of the 1976 Euros; and Brazil, who won the 1994 World Cup and lost in the final in 1998, while reaching three successive Copa Am\u00e9rica finals \u2013 1995, 1997 and 1999, winning two and losing one.

This was, first and foremost, a team of workers, including, among other professions, a meat-packer, a marble-cutter, a grocer and an ice salesman. They travelled to Europe in steerage and played to pay for their board, winning nine friendlies in Spain before they even reached France. Uruguay were the first Latin American side to tour Europe, but they attracted little attention \u2013 at least initially \u2013 only around 2,000 turning up to watch them eviscerate Yugoslavia 7-0 in their opening game in the Olympics. Word soon got around. &quot;Game after game,&quot; the poet Eduardo Galeano wrote, &quot;the crowd jostled to see those men, slippery as squirrels, who played chess with a ball. The English squad had perfected the long pass and the high ball but these disinherited children from far-off America didn&apos;t walk in their father&apos;s footsteps. They chose to invent a game of close passes directly to the foot, with lightning changes in rhythm and high-speed dribbling.&quot; In four games they scored 17 goals and conceded just two in their four matches, beating a Switzerland side co-managed by the remarkable trio of Jimmy Hogan, Teddy Duckworth and Dori Kurschner 3-0 in the final. Uruguay, wrote Gabriel Hanot, the editor of L&apos;Equipe, showed &quot;marvellous virtuosity in receiving the ball, controlling it and using it. They created a beautiful football, elegant but at the same time varied, rapid, powerful and effective&quot;. And British football? &quot;It is like comparing Arab thoroughbreds to farm horses.&quot; Argentina, who hadn&apos;t travelled to France, were furious and, on Uruguay&apos;s return, challenged them to a game, winning 3-2 on aggregate after crowd trouble curtailed the second leg in Buenos Aires. When they met in the finals of the 1928 Olympics and the 1940 World Cup, though, Uruguay emerged triumphant. &quot;Argentina,&quot; wrote the great Italian journalist Gianni Brera, &quot;play football with a lot of imagination and elegance, but technical superiority cannot compensate for the abandonment of tactics. Between the two Rioplatense national teams, the ants are the Uruguayans, the cicadas are the Argentinians.&quot; ITALY 1934-38 1934 World Cup final Stadio del PNF, Rome: 2-1 (aet) v Czechoslovakia (Orsi, Schiavio; Puc) Combi (c); Monzeglio, Allemandi; Ferraris, Monti, Bertolini; Guaita, Meazza, Schiavio, Ferrari, Orsi 1936 Olympic final Olympiastadion, Berlin: 2-1 (aet) v Austria (Frossi 2, Kainberger) Venturini; Foni (c), Rava; Baldo, Piccini, Locatelli; Frossi, Marchini, Bertoni, Biagi, Gabriotti 1938 World Cup final Colombes, Paris: 4-2 v Hungary (Colaussi 2, Piola 2; Titkos, Sarosi) Olivieri; Foni, Rava; Serantoni, Andreolo, Locatelli; Biavati, Meazza (c), Piola, Ferrari, Colaussi It&apos;s debatable whether it&apos;s fair to include Italy in this list. Theirs was a professional league and so, although two players graduated from the Olympic-winning team to the 1938 World Cup side, the two squads were essentially discrete \u2013 far more different than the Uruguay side of the previous decade. Nonetheless, the team Vittorio Pozzo put together in his third spell in charge of the national side was by some distance the best on the world. Although he was an anglophile and a great friend of Herbert Chapman, he disdained the stopper centre-half and W-M system Chapman had instated at Arsenal, instead preferring what he called the m\u00e9todo, in which the centre-half occupied a halfway house between defence and midfield, dropping when the other team had possession and marking the opposing centre-forward but advancing to become an attacking fulcrum when his side had the ball. In Luisito Monti, a naturalised Argentinian who had played in the 1930 World Cup final, Pozzo found the perfect man for the role \u2013 a hard, ruthless tackler who could also read the game and pass the ball. Pozzo was an early devotee of man-marking and there was a steeliness and nationalistic fervour about his sides that was not to all tastes, but their effectiveness is beyond doubt \u2013 although they were probably fortunate to meet the Austrian Wunderteam in the 1934 final when they were just past their peak. And in Giuseppe Meazza they had one of the most intelligent and gifted inside-forwards there has ever been: they had rigour and finesse. &quot;The big secret of the Italian squad,&quot; the journalist Mario Zappa wrote in Gazzetta dello Sport, &quot;is its capacity to attack with the fewest amount of men possible without ever distracting the half-backs from their defensive work.&quot; WEST GERMANY 1972 European Championship final Heysel, Brussels: 3-0 v USSR (G M\u00fcller 2, Wimmer) Maier; H\u00fcttges, Beckenbauer (c), Schwarzenbeck, Breitner; U Hoeness, Wimmer, Netzer; Heynckes, G M\u00fcller, E\u00a0Kremers 1974 World Cup final Olympiastadion, Munich: 2-1 v Holland (Breitner (pen), G\u00a0M\u00fcller; Neeskens (pen) Maier; Vogts, Beckenbauer (c), Schwarzenbeck, Breitner; Bonhof, U\u00a0Hoeness, Overath; Grabowski, G M\u00fcller, Holzenbein 1976 European Championship final Marakana, Belgrade: 2-2 v Czechoslovakia (lost on pens) (D M\u00fcller, Holzenbein; Svehlik, Dobias) Maier; Vogts, Beckenbauer (c), Schwarzenbeck, Dietz; Bonhof; Wimmer (Flohe h-t), U Hoeness; Beer (Bongartz 80); D M\u00fcller, Holzenbein Perhaps no side is so traduced in the popular consciousness as the West Germany of the early-mid-70s. Love of the Dutch, with their sense of bohemian cool, perhaps casts the Germans as their opposite, but this was a wonderful team who passed and moved with great invention and elan and managed to do so without the crushing high offside line and pressing of Rinus Michel&apos;s Holland. It&apos;s said the German variant of total football came together at the 1970 World Cup in the heat of Le\u00f3n, as players sought to move the ball into the shade of the stand. Their football probably reached its peak in 1972. They were breathtaking in beating England 3-1 in the first leg of the quarter-final at Wembley, particularly in the first half-hour, as the ball zipped across the pitch in exquisite patterns. L&apos;Equipe hailed Germany&apos;s fluent, passing approach as &quot;football from the year 2000&quot;. Beckenbauer was exemplary, but the two key players were the Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach pairing of Herbert Wimmer and G\u00fcnter Netzer who, between them, ran the midfield. &quot;The magnitude of our performance,&quot; said Beckenbauer, &quot;was really just like a dream. I have never shared in a finer West German performance. Everything we wanted to do, we did. The moves, the idea and the execution all happened.&quot; The 3-0 win over the USSR in the final was almost as impressive but by the time of the World Cup Netzer had gone, his unpredictability having no place in a West Germany side that, while not cautious, didn&apos;t take the same risks as it had while thrusting towards success. By 1976, the team was clearly past its best, but it showed tremendous character to come from two behind to beat the hosts Yugoslavia in the semi-final with a Dieter M\u00fcller hat-trick. They came from two behind in the final as well but, having secured a draw, lost the penalty shootout to Antonin Panenka&apos;s much-imitated chip.

There surely has never been a footballer whose reputation is so out of sync with his achievements as Dunga. He may not have pulsed with the samba rhythms of Brazilian stereotype, but for most of the 90s he was the world&apos;s best holding midfielder, providing a platform for the more technically gifted players to express themselves. Brazil&apos;s record could easily be better even than five straight finals: in 1991 they finished second in the four team group that concluded the Copa Am\u00e9rica and in 1993 they battered Argentina in the quarter-final only to lose on penalties. They then went on to win the 2002 World Cup \u2013 the 2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica quarter-final exit to Honduras a humiliation that marked just how low they sank in qualifying for the tournament in Japan and South Korea, even if they did effectively field a second-string in Colombia (at least they went; Argentina and Canada withdrew on security grounds). And, of course, anything might have happened in that 1998 final had it not been for Ronaldo&apos;s fit and the disruption that caused. It is easy to overlook as well how poor Brazil&apos;s Copa Am\u00e9rica record was before the 90s. Before that victory on Bolivia, they&apos;d never won the tournament on foreign soil; for all the scepticism about their pragmatism, winning the World Cup in 1994 after a 24-year hiatus and winning back-to-back Copas abroad was an extraordinary effort of will. The coach changed \u2013 from Carlos Alberto Parreira (1991-94) to Mario Zagallo (94-98) and then Vanderlei Luxemburgo (98-00) \u2013 but the style was essentially similar: attacking full-backs in Cafu and Roberto Carlos given licence by two holding midfielders (Dunga plus one essentially), with two creators playing narrow ahead of them and then two central strikers. Perhaps they never had one great tournament that really captured the imagination, but the consistency of Brazil in the 90s is unique.", "sentences": ["URUGUAY 1924-30 1924 Olympic final Colombes, Paris 3-0 v Switzerland (Petrone, Cea, Romano) Mazali; Nasazzi (c), Arispe; Andrade, Vidal, Ghierra; Urdinar\u00e1n, Scarone, Petrone, Cea, Romano 1928 Olympic final Olympisch, Amsterdam 1-1 v Argentina (Petrone; Ferreyra) Mazali; Nasazzi (c), Arispe; Andrade, Fern\u00e1ndez, Gestido; Urdinar\u00e1n, Castro, Petrone, Cea, Campolo 1928 Olympic final replay Olympisch, Amsterdam: 2-1 v Argentina (Figueroa, Scarone; Monti) Mazali; Nasazzi (c), Arispe; Andrade, Piriz, Gestido; Arremon, Scarone, Borjas, Cea, Figueroa 1930 World Cup final Centenario, Montevideo: 4-2 v Argentina (Dorado, Cea, Iriarte, Castro; Peucelle, Stabile) Ballestero; Mascheroni, Nasazzi (c); Andrade, Fern\u00e1ndez, Gestido; Dorado, Scarone, Castro, Cea, Iriarte Uruguay&apos;s success at the Paris Olympics is one of the great romantic tales."], "title": "Euro 2012: Now Spain have entered the pantheon of greatness | Jonathan Wilson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jun/28/euro-2012-spain-all-time-greats", "tags": ["Euro 2012", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-29T12:09:00Z", "article": "If you want to imagine what life is like for app developers and ODMs (original device makers - the companies such as Asus, Samsung, Lenovo, Dell and so on that make tablets and PCs and smartphones) just now, imagine you&apos;re in a desert at night. Right beside you is a big flaming campfire, whose owners offer large amounts of food and water - but only to developers. A little way from that are two other campfires - one very big, but starting to sputter, and offering only limited supplies to developers and ODMs; the other burning more strongly, but parcelling out the most meagre of rations. And the latter has a big guy standing beside it who sometimes takes away your rations if you get too close. The campfires are the iOS market (iPad and iPhone), the PC market and the Android handset market. The iPad market looks great if you&apos;re a developer; OK, so you have to perform some rituals to get the handouts, but it&apos;s good when it&apos;s good. For ODMs, though (and indeed for also-ran developers), the iPad offers no sustenance.  The PC market, by contrast, is long-established, but it&apos;s not growing - there are in fact strong signs that it&apos;s going into reverse as tablets become a bigger part of our life - and for ODMs, the pickings are thin unless you&apos;re selling in huge volumes into the Far East, and especially China (as Lenovo is). For HP, the PC division is its least profitable; Dell barely makes any money from its consumer market (which is just selling PCs). And Android handsets are a great business - if you&apos;re Samsung. For Sony, Motorola Mobility, LG.. it&apos;s terrible. And developers, while plentiful, aren&apos;t rolling in cash. And now in this scenario, Microsoft and Google have fired two flaming arrows into the air. Their hope: that they&apos;ll start two new fires to rival the iPad&apos;s. Yet the risk is that they&apos;ll do exactly the same - sustaining developers and not ODMs. The Surface: when will it reach land? The Surface first. What&apos;s really bizarre about this device is that even while Microsoft has been talking up Windows 8 and the Metro interface and the &quot;slate&quot; format, it also went ahead and rush-launched this sort-of product.  That the Surface press conference was a rush is evident from the secrecy and unpreparedness. Mutiple sources in and around Microsoft UK have told me that they had no idea ahead of time that it was happening. The four-day advance warning was short enough, but even Microsoft&apos;s headquarters doesn&apos;t seem to have got its strategy figured out. There were no prices, no dates, the minimum of specifications, and what seems to have dribbled out is that Surface will be Wi-Fi only, with no 3G. (The latter point won&apos;t make it popular with enterprises; business people actually value the 3G iPad&apos;s connectivity when out and about, though it simplifies the software.) Most of all, the company that is known above all for its software didn&apos;t show any software worth the name running on its machine. After the press conference, there was very limited time to use them afterwards; nobody seems to have used the plastic keyboard with a live screen to any extent. (I&apos;ve asked people who used the devices at the press conference, and yes, I&apos;ve seen Danny Sullivan&apos;s report. He&apos;s not exactly right on every point - from my understanding of it - but is right that nobody got to properly try the keyboard covers to do any amount of typing.) Sullivan&apos;s post is revealing, though. Here&apos;s a key part, where he shows a photo of some hands holding a Surface:   That&apos;s not a journalist holding Surface. It&apos;s one of the Microsoft guys. They&apos;d swing them around with a pretty picture on the front, I guess so we&apos;d go &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;ahh.&quot; If we were lucky, we were allowed to hold one for a few seconds. But if you tried to do anything with it, bang, it was gone. Believe me, I know. I tried. I had kept hearing everyone on Twitter screaming about how no one at Microsoft was saying what the screen resolution was. Since it was such a big uber-secret, I figured I&apos;d try to find out. After asking repeatedly if I could hold one \u2014 I felt like a seven-year-old, &quot;please can I hold it, please can I try, would you mind if I try&quot; \u2014 one of the Microsoft guys gave me a shot. I brought up the Start screen by hitting the Windows button on the front of the tablet, hit Desktop to get to the Windows 8 desktop, did a long press guessing that would bring up the Screen Resolution setting and it did \u2014 at which point, the unit was literally jerked out of my hands.  Why would a software company show off its big hardware bet on a new form factor where it hasn&apos;t made any impact and yet not show any software?  Because with Surface, Microsoft is trying to gee up developers to aim towards having tablet and Metro apps for the time when it comes out - at some uncertain point in the future. Surface isn&apos;t ready. Windows 8 isn&apos;t ready - it hasn&apos;t been released to manufacture yet, and the demonstrations at TechEd 2012 in Amsterdam indicate that there are still glitches to be ironed out.  Flocking problem But Microsoft needs at least two things to happen: ODMs to start building tablets, and developers to start writing apps that will run on those tablets.  There&apos;s another, simpler explanation of the rush to show off Surface: getting the PR boost from being ahead of Google, whose Nexus tablet launch was intended to be made to look like a third entrant into a race. The problem is that Surface, and Windows 8, doesn&apos;t exist yet. So are developers rushing to follow that flaming arrow? Not so far. They don&apos;t know quite when or where it&apos;s going to land. They&apos;re sort of hoping to follow the ODMs, because wherever they run to usually means that there&apos;s replenishment to be had. The ODMs, of course, think the same about the developers; you end up with behaviour that looks like a flock: nobody&apos;s the leader, but everyone knows what they should do - follow the leader.  But especially in this case, the ODMs aren&apos;t really sure about following Microsoft&apos;s flaming arrow. Quite probably Steve Ballmer&apos;s team has taken advantage of a contract manufacturer in China to make the Surface. It&apos;s intriguing that Taiwan&apos;s Digitimes, usually a reliable channel of the latest rumours from the ever-gossipy contract manufacturers, hasn&apos;t ferreted out the Surface maker; that either means Microsoft is imposing Apple-style secrecy on the process - in which case, round of applause - or that they just haven&apos;t started making it in volume yet. Either way, don&apos;t expect anything ahead of October. The flaming arrow is still in the air and is yet to land. Microsoft is hoping, really hoping, that developers will start running after it. The trouble is that they don&apos;t seem to be. On Wednesday I sat through a two-hour presentation of Windows 8 at TechEd 2012 in Amsterdam, after which Barry Collins of PC Pro magazine muttered &quot;well, that&apos;s been a demo of eight applications that we&apos;ve already seen before.&quot; Which was true: there wasn&apos;t a single thing in app terms which hadn&apos;t been there at Build. Nothing new at all. And that fact alone indicates that developers aren&apos;t moving very quickly after the flaming arrow 0 or indeed the other ones shot into the air ahead of Windows 8. Nexus: joining the tablet threads together And now the next flaming arrow: the Google Nexus 7, made by Asus as a showcase for Google&apos;s tablet ambitions. Quite a bitter pill for Motorola Mobility, which was favoured with the first release of Honeycomb, aka Android 3.0, in January 2011 - remember everyone&apos;s favourite iPad-killer, the Xoom? - but Google seems serious. Andy Rubin, the head of Android, told AllThingsD that he analysed the market in mid-2011 and realised that for consumers (who were the principal market), what mattered was content (such as apps and music and video). Android tablet sales haven&apos;t set anything on fire, of course - ODMs and developers pick up scraps from the fire of handsets, but there isn&apos;t the volume and so no scale. For app developers, you might as well focus on the handset market, because it&apos;s busy, thriving and expanding. Android tablets.. not so much. And now Google has fired an arrow away from the iPad, towards the 7in, low-cost territory. Carolina Milanesi, Gartner&apos;s smartphone analyst, puts it like this: &quot;Microsoft has done Surface to revamp its brand and give a clear sign that it will be part of the post-PC era as much as it was part of the PC one. Android with Nexus 7 is adding to the smartphone facility as a medium to deliver its content and services. It is a means to an end - owning you as a consumer in their ecosystem while at the same time nudging ODMs to move into the $199 sweet spot for consumers.&quot; But do the ODMs want to be nudged? Posslby they haven&apos;t got a choice. Amazon, explains Milanesi, &quot;was interested in extending the Kindle family and concentrating on selling its content. The Nexus 7 will be competing more with the Kindle Fire, while Surface will compete more with iPad within the professional user and enterprise market. Both the Nexus 7 and Surface are more important for the impact they will have in their ecosystems, not the number of sales they will achieve, as their distribution is limited.&quot; Reaction from people who&apos;ve laid hands on the Nexus 7 has been positive - it runs the software and it&apos;s attractive. The price is attractive too. When you compare the Surface and the Nexus 7, you&apos;d have to say that right now one is almost vapourware, while the other is already coming out of Asus factories somewhere in the Far East. Especially compared to Android, Windows 8 doesn&apos;t exist on tablets. The Microsoft (App) Store isn&apos;t properly open, and you can&apos;t buy - or even pre-order - a Surface. Steve Ballmer stole a march on Google for publicity, but that&apos;s all it&apos;s been. Yet nothing&apos;s really changed about the campfires. For ODMs, there are few pickings to be had anywhere, unless you&apos;re Samsung. And those two flaming arrows are in the air. The question now is which way the developers are going to run. They don&apos;t seem to be running after Windows 8 very quickly, if the TechEd demos are anything to go by. Oh Dear Me But for ODMs, where&apos;s the joy in Android tablets? Tim Anderson points out that Google&apos;s quite a threat to them on its own: he tried out a pretty dire 7in Android tablet by Gemini running Ice Cream Sandwich: &quot;I thought the JoyTAB was at least good value at \u00a3149.00. What chance does it have against a Nexus 7 for just \u00a310 more \u2013 and with \u00a315 of Play Store credit thrown in?&quot; In the short term? None, really, and ODMs will have to hope that distribution of the Nexus 7 will be limited. Google is clearly subsidising its cost - Asus wouldn&apos;t retail a product with those qualities at that price, because there would be a negative margin in it.  But by selling it in the US and Europe, the two biggest tablet markets outside China and Korea, Google&apos;s cutting other ODMs - including Motorola, which of course it owns - off at the knees. All that ODMs have left is the knife-fight of low-cost selling in those countries, where price is all. Developers aren&apos;t interested in that; people who buy those tablets don&apos;t pay for apps. For ODMs, then, the darkness is gathering. PC sales aren&apos;t growing (and most have long since been commodities). Android handsets are commodities. Windows 8 tablets, which might be money-making, are a guess at best. Google&apos;s slicing into their potential market for tablets. They&apos;ll be praying that those arrows land soon and start a nice, warming fire.", "sentences": ["Windows 8 isn&apos;t ready - it hasn&apos;t been released to manufacture yet, and the demonstrations at TechEd 2012 in Amsterdam indicate that there are still glitches to be ironed out.", "On Wednesday I sat through a two-hour presentation of Windows 8 at TechEd 2012 in Amsterdam, after which Barry Collins of PC Pro magazine muttered &quot;well, that&apos;s been a demo of eight applications that we&apos;ve already seen before.&quot; Which was true: there wasn&apos;t a single thing in app terms which hadn&apos;t been there at Build."], "title": "Google Nexus 7 and Microsoft Surface: flaming arrows in the desert air", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/jun/29/google-nexus-7-microsoft-surface", "tags": ["Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "Apple", "iPad", "Android", "Google", "Microsoft", "Windows", "Apps", "Software", "Programming", "Internet"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-06-30T23:03:00Z", "article": "JULY 1 Pop The Stone Roses The third resurrection of the Roses has already swung from thrill to farce.

Jokes about The Singing Nun and Plastic Bertrand are still common currency on this side of the channel but Belgium&apos;s contribution to continental pop, particularly in the field of dance music, has been phenomenal.  Half the country may speak Dutch and the other half French, with separate charts for each region, but that hasn&apos;t hindered the development of a music scene distinct from either of its counterparts across the border. Although divided by language, Belgium gives every indication of being united by dry humour and a willingness to embrace new sounds which, in combination, have kept it in Europe&apos;s pop elite for five decades. Here are 10 clips, from chanson to hip-hop, that show the country at its sparkling best. Jacques Brel \u2013 Amsterdam (1964)            Despite being one of the most electrifying performers of his era, Jacques Brel is perversely better known in the English-speaking world through covers of his songs. Perhaps the greatest marker of his genius is how many legendary stars have fallen short in their attempts to replicate his work. From David Bowie to Scott Walker, many of pop&apos;s most iconic voices have sounded bloodless next to the searing source material. With the same eye for visceral detail as a Frans Snyders painting, Amsterdam&apos;s tale of sailors on shore leave glistens with sweat and other bodily fluids. Adamo \u2013 Inch Allah (1967)            The modern pop-chanson of singers such as Lara Fabian remains one of Belgium&apos;s biggest exports but nobody has ever been able to replicate the extraordinary commercial success of Sicilian-born Salvatore Adamo \u2013 almost unknown in the UK despite selling a reported 100m records worldwide. Conceived as a plea for reconciliation after the Six Day War, at a time when most of Europe&apos;s floppy-haired troubadours were preoccupied with Vietnam, Inch Allah was as powerful a ballad as the 60s peace movement delivered. As it was widely banned throughout the Middle East for being perceived as too sympathetic to Israel, the effectiveness of its message was presumably limited. Telex \u2013 Moskow Discow (1979)            In comparison to its nearest neighbours, Belgium played a relatively minor role in the first waves of punk and disco but acts such as Telex and Snowy Red helped pioneer the early synth-pop movement that fused the bare-essentials discipline of the former with the dancefloor readiness of the latter. Where Gary Numan had studied seriousness and Giorgio Moroder sleek leather and chrome perfectionism, Telex offered a very Belgian deadpan humour. Although most famous for being the first group to deliberately try to come last at Eurovision, an effort foiled by a rogue 10 points from Portugal, their finest three minutes can be found on 1979&apos;s superb single Moscow Discow. Lio \u2013 Sage Comme Une Image (1980)            Even though Telex&apos;s commercial appeal was limited, their protege Lio gave Belgium a superstar to rival any France had to offer. Having played the bratty teenager on novelty electro hit Le Banana Split, she switched to sophisticated disco-pop for the sparkling Sage Comme Une Image, warning potential suitors that she was as flawless and unapproachable as the glossy pictures on record sleeves. Currently a judge on Belgium&apos;s version of The Voice, which seems a little unfair given that we&apos;re lumbered with Jessie J, she remains popular across Francophone Europe. Her younger sister, the equally wonderful Helena Noguerra, sings with Nouvelle Vague. The Honeymoon Killers \u2013 Decollage (1982)            With Brussels home to Crammed Discs, one of the most exciting independent record labels in Europe, Belgium&apos;s rock scene has always had more to boast about than pale copies of US trends in the mould of dEUS and K&apos;s Choice. There are few better examples than the Honeymoon Killers \u2013 a band whose combination of indie pop, jazz and African influences echoed the pioneering spirit of Talking Heads without ever lapsing into imitation. Decollage, from their outstanding debut album Les Tueurs De La Lune De Miel, has the slinky, sinister elegance of a panther. Front 242 \u2013 Take One (1984)            The common thread running through acts as varied as Rammstein and Lady Gaga, EBM merged the industrial noise of Throbbing Gristle with austere German electro to form an aggressive new style perfectly suited to raves in burnt-out Mitteleuropean warehouses or, at a push, goth night at the Camden Palace. The genre&apos;s founding fathers Front 242, who borrowed the term &quot;electronic body music&quot; from Kraftwerk&apos;s Ralf H\u00fctter to describe their innovative 1984 album No Comment, have a strong claim to being the most influential Belgians since Brel. Pulsing single Take One captured them at their early peak. Clouseau \u2013 Daar Gaat Ze (1990)            Given how few bands from the Netherlands seem prepared to sing in Dutch, it shouldn&apos;t come as an enormous surprise to find that Flemish performers also tend to favour English over the native language of Flanders. One of the most successful exceptions has been Clouseau who have been a standard bearer for Vlaams-pop for more than 25 years with gentle MOR hits such as the beguiling Daar Gaat Ze. The group incurred the wrath of the far-right Flemish separatist movement by releasing bilingual unity anthem Leve Belgi\u00eb during a period of elevated political tension that would see the country go 18 months without an officially elected government. Pleasure Game \u2013 Le Dormeur (1991)            Influenced by acid house and the industrial electro of Front 242, the new beat style that became the country&apos;s trademark in the late 80s offered a darker, harder alternative to the Italian-inspired Euro dance that dominated the rest of the continent. In contrast to the dated schoolboy smut of more celebrated compatriots Lords of Acid, a group better suited to suburban fetish conventions and creepy fan-made anime tribute videos than contemporary club play, the early hits of the exceptional Pleasure Game sound as fresh as they did in 1991. Booming single Le Dormeur sits alongside Technotronic&apos;s timeless Pump Up the Jam as one of the greatest dance records Belgium, and Europe, has ever produced. Lasgo \u2013 Something (2001)            Driven more by a standard musical formula than by personality, European trance acts have a tendency to blend into one indistinguishable mass in the minds of many pop fans. It&apos;s perfectly possible to be familiar with the songs without knowing the names of the artists or to be familiar with the names of the artists without realising what an enormous percentage of them come from Belgium. From Milk Inc to Ian van Dahl, maudlin vocals and rudimentary synth arpeggios have been the country&apos;s primary route into the British charts for more than 10 years. Lasgo&apos;s stirring Something, although firmly adhering to the template, packs more of an emotional punch than most of its competitors put together. Baloji \u2013 Tout Ceci Ne Vous Rendra Pas Le Congo (2007)            Belgium&apos;s rule of Congo was marked by such brutal inhumanity it even managed to draw the disapproval of the British, and the legacy of the colonial era is still being played out in the war-torn African state today. Nobody is better placed to explore the complicated relationship between the two countries than Belgium&apos;s large Congolese diaspora. Arguing that a mixture of internal division and international exploitation has left the nation of his birth as plagued by horror as it was under King Leopold, Antwerp rapper Baloji brings a righteous fire to the astonishing Tout Ceci Ne Vous Rendra Pas Le Congo.

No architect has cared more about how children inhabit cities than Van Eyck, who in 30 or so years after the end of the second world war built more than 700 playgrounds across Amsterdam. Van Eyck springs to mind because of the London Festival of Architecture, which is tapping into Olympic fever this summer with the theme &quot;The Playful City&quot;. As part of the programme, two temporary playgrounds are opening in King&apos;s Cross next weekend. One is a series of installations made of recycled materials by students from Central Saint Martins, and the other is the Imagination Playground, a kit of parts designed by the Rockwell Group, which children can assemble like a giant puzzle. No doubt these will be enjoyable additions to the developer&apos;s playground that is currently King&apos;s Cross. To me, however, there is no playground like an adventure playground.     Doors lead the way to more adventure at Kilburn Grange playground. Photograph: Erect Architecture    I remember the summer of 1984 not chiefly for the Los Angeles Olympics, but for the discovery of my local adventure playground. Whatever Carl Lewis was up to, my younger brother and I had imaginary pirate ships to board, with real ropes and wooden platforms \u2013 and the rope burns and splinters to prove it. There was even a zip cord, which put us in true Indiana Jones territory. Here, in this visibly anarchic place made of old telegraph poles and wonky planks, was an urban anomaly that tolerated mess and wild behaviour. This was brilliant, because it&apos;s hard to emulate your heroes on a mere seesaw. Van Eyck believed playgrounds should challenge a child&apos;s imagination without jarring the adult&apos;s aesthetic sensibilities. His abstract, elementary forms \u2013 often manufactured out of metal tubes like modernist furniture \u2013 were meant to belong in a well-mannered streetscape. During the same period in Britain, however, we were developing a tradition of playground design that was almost diametrically opposed. The first &quot;junk&quot; playgrounds emerged amid the rubble of the Blitz, and the results were far less polite. Consisting of makeshift structures cobbled together out of roof beams and detritus, they were often designed with the assistance of the children themselves. That essential character survives today in descendants such as Glamis Adventure Playground in Shadwell, east London, a riot of skew-whiff woodwork and clashing colours, and an odd hybrid of post-war austerity and postmodern assemblage. The junk playground model was created by the Danish architect Carl Theodor Sorensen, who believed playgrounds should reflect the imagination of the child not the architect. In 1943, having observed the creative way children play in construction sites, he developed the prototype junk playground on the Emdrup housing estate in Copenhagen. The concept was brought to Britain by Lady Allen of Hurtwood, who tested it out on the site of a bombed church in Camberwell and then built dozens of what she called &quot;adventure playgrounds&quot; \u2013 the term &quot;junk&quot; tended to turn local mothers into nimbys. Not only did Allen feel that ordinary playgrounds were sterile places (&quot;it is little wonder that [children] prefer the dumps of rough wood and piles of bricks and rubbish of the bombed sites&quot;), but she believed in the healing effects of exposing children to the urban scars of warfare. At the same time, having them take part in the post-war reconstruction effort was deemed a good way of shaping model citizens. Essentially, all playgrounds are designed to do the same thing: to help children develop their abilities, use up excess energy and keep them off the streets. But the ideology of the adventure playground is interesting for several reasons. First, there&apos;s the notion of not restricting children to the repetitive motions of the slide or swing, because the sooner you reach the technical limits of the equipment, the sooner you have to stretch those limits \u2013 hence all those swings you see coiled around the crossbar. The adventure playground was designed to liberate the wild thing within and, by exposing children to risk, teach them personal responsibility (all forms of play are underpinned by some form of didactism, so it&apos;s worth reminding ourselves that this is also simply more fun). Just as crucially, it was intrinsic to the concept that children be involved in designing the playgrounds, dreaming up weird structures and adapting them later by tacking on extra elements. This participatory dimension, managed by volunteer play leaders, is key to the development of their creativity.     Children can build their own playground with this kit from the Rockwell Group.  Photograph: Rockwell Group    It&apos;s curious how much the ethos of the adventure playground chimes with the language of a new era of design today: a &quot;participatory&quot; process, recycled materials, an adaptive product. It doesn&apos;t sound like the 1940s. But equally valuable is the zone of exception that the adventure playground represents in the city, one of improvisation and informality that, pace Van Eyck, does not blend in to a polite streetscape. Today, there are few true adventure playgrounds left, but occasionally another is built that follows all the essential tenets, such as the Kilburn Grange Park playground in north London, designed last year by Erect Architecture and based on the ideas of local kids. Increasingly, though, &quot;adventure playgrounds&quot; are produced by specialist manufacturers and merely designed to look rustic. You can&apos;t adapt them, or at least anyone who tried would be carted off. These are the products of a health and safety culture that watered down adventure playgrounds in the 1980s and 90s. There was a minor revival a few years ago, when the Labour government invested \u00a3230m in new play spaces across England, but the coalition government freed that budget up for other uses, so it was short-lived. And now, with the cuts, several adventure playgrounds, including the giant ones in Battersea and Kilburn, face losing the play workers that make such playgrounds what they are. It&apos;s worth remembering just how cheap and yet how luxurious these spaces are. We should let kids loose on this new breed of sanitised playground, to inject a little of the old spirit in them.

Four months after losing his job at Chelsea, and three weeks after the dismissal of Harry Redknapp, the 34-year-old was confirmed as the head coach of Spurs on a three-year contract on Tuesday. The Portuguese has been joined by the first-team fitness coach, Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rio Rocha, and head of opposition scouting, Daniel Sousa \u2013 his staff during a triumphant season at Porto but also an ill-fated nine months at Stamford Bridge \u2013 and his arrival is likely to signal a hectic transfer period at the club. The key issue facing Villas-Boas is the future of Luka Modric and a potential replacement for the influential Croatia international, who is wanted by Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid. Despite having four years left on his contract, Modric is determined to leave after Spurs failed to qualify for the Champions League and having been denied the chance to join Villas-Boas at Chelsea last summer. Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, is equally resolved to refuse the 26-year-old a move to a Premier League rival. Villas-Boas is prepared for Modric&apos;s exit, however, and has identified Moutinho as his main transfer target. The pair enjoyed a glorious season together at Porto in 2010-11 \u2013 when Villas-Boas led the club to the league title with an unbeaten record, the Portuguese Cup and the Europa League \u2013 and the midfielder, who enhanced his reputation at Euro 2012, is keen on a reunion with his former coach. &quot;AVB is one of the best coaches I&apos;ve worked with,&quot; the 25-year-old said recently. &quot;I&apos;d work with him again tomorrow.&quot; United have also been linked with Moutinho and Levy would have to sanction a club-record fee for Spurs to sign the Portugal international. Porto value him at \u20ac35m (\u00a328m) and even a compromise fee would dwarf the \u00a316.75m Tottenham paid Dinamo Zagreb for Modric in 2008. Tottenham stand to make a lucrative profit on Modric and have moved for the Hoffenheim midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson, who has rejected a \u00a36.8m transfer to Swansea City and is stalling on a deal with Liverpool over personal terms. They also hope to complete the \u00a39.5m signing of the Ajax defender Jan Vertonghen, despite problems over his release from the Amsterdam club, and the Internacional midfielder Oscar dos Santos Emboaba J\u00fanior. They also need to improve a strikeforce that currently amounts to Jermain Defoe. Emanuel Adebayor remains a target after his successful loan last season but his \u00a3170,000-a-week wages at Manchester City are beyond Spurs. Villas-Boas, who has been scouting in Brazil this summer, admires the Internacional striker Leandro Dami\u00e3o and Spurs have a sporting partnership with the Brazilian club. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn and Ricardo Carvalho could also be used in a player-plus-cash deal with Real Madrid for Modric. Levy, on welcoming the club&apos;s new head coach on Tuesday, said: &quot;We are constantly looking to move the club forward. It is important that we now look to develop the potential within the squads at all levels, whilst strengthening the first team in the summer in key positions with players who will become part of the future success of the club.&quot; Villas-Boas has been charged with the task of developing a younger team at Tottenham while qualifying for the Champions League, similar to the task he was given by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea only to alienate several senior and influential players before being sacked nine months into a three-year contract. His successor, Roberto Di Matteo, guided Chelsea to the FA Cup and Champions League double. Levy considered several candidates to replace Redknapp, including the former France coach Laurent Blanc, the Everton manager, David Moyes, and Roberto Mart\u00ednez of Wigan Athletic but quickly settled on Villas-Boas as his favoured choice and completed the appointment after further talks in London on Monday night. The Portuguese coach was unable to sign for another English club until after 1 July under the terms of his exit from Chelsea and is believed to have sought the European champions&apos; permission to join Spurs before signing his contract. Villas-Boas said: &quot;Tottenham Hotspur is a great club with a strong tradition and fantastic support, both at home and throughout the world. I feel privileged to be its coach. For me this is one of the most exciting coaching positions in the Premier League. I have had several discussions with the chairman and the board and I share their vision for the future progress of the club. This is a squad any coach would love to work with and together I believe we can bring success in the seasons ahead.&quot;", "sentences": ["They also hope to complete the \u00a39.5m signing of the Ajax defender Jan Vertonghen, despite problems over his release from the Amsterdam club, and the Internacional midfielder Oscar dos Santos Emboaba J\u00fanior."], "title": "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas starts life at Spurs by targeting Jo\u00e3o Moutinho", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/03/tottenham-andre-villas-boas-manager", "tags": ["Tottenham Hotspur", "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-07-04T11:00:00Z", "article": "Jan Morris, Hong Kong (1997) In its last days under British rule, Jan Morris explores Hong Kong&apos;s complex past, present \u2013 and future. &quot;It is more than a city actually, being an archipelago of some 235 rocks and islands attendant upon a squat mountainous peninsula.

The operation was led by the Metropolitan police&apos;s Counter Terrorism Command, and aided by the UK&apos;s National Domestic Extremism Unit, as well as the national crime squad in the Netherlands. &quot;The three arrests mark a significant development in a long-running, proactive investigation into alleged criminal activity across Europe,&quot; the police statement said.", "sentences": ["Police in London and Amsterdam have arrested three people following a long-running, British-led investigation into blackmail connected to militant animal rights groups.", "In Amsterdam, officers from the Dutch national crime squad arrested a woman and a man, both aged 25, under a European arrest warrant."], "title": "Three arrests in Europe-wide investigation into animal rights groups", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/06/three-arrested-investigation-animal-rights", "tags": ["Metropolitan police", "London", "UK news", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-07-07T23:04:12Z", "article": "In one of those odd-seeming consequences cinema nevertheless regularly turns up, Willem Dafoe narrated a piece called The Life and Death of Marina Abramovic, premiering in Manchester last year. While he stars on screen in The Hunter this week, she is now the subject of an excellent documentary about the staging of her own retrospective show, The Artist Is Present, at New York&apos;s Museum of Modern Art in 2010. For that show, she sat for seven and half hours, every day, for three months, on a chair, without food or water, gazing into the eyes, expressionless, of audience members and visitors who sat opposite her, gazing back. It was a staring contest of the sort kids do in the playground, but performed with utter seriousness and solemnity in one of the world&apos;s great galleries. How, asks the documentary, was this art? Matthew Akers&apos;s fascinating film ponders not only the nature and validity of performance art but paints a somewhat hagiographic portrait of Abramovic as the movement&apos;s &quot;grandmother&quot;. Charismatic and beautiful at 64, the daughter of two national heroes of General Tito&apos;s Yugoslavia, Marina began her career in 1970s Belgrade \u2013 where many considered her insane \u2013 and continued when she met Ulay, another\u00a0performance artist, in Amsterdam. The pair began a series now dubbed The Relation Works, examining the pain, power and physicality of love and coexistence. &quot;I\u00a0fell in love with her when I saw her\u00a0cut a pentagram in her stomach with a razor blade,&quot; recalls Ulay. If their affair were ever made into a movie, Marina would be played by Anjelica Huston and Ulay by Jeremy Irons. &quot;Theirs is one of the world&apos;s great love stories,&quot; opines the very cool, eloquent and English-born Whitney Museum curator Chrissie Iles; and this documentary certainly probes that part of Abramovic&apos;s life with great thoroughness, even engineering a reunion between the pair.

One thing guaranteed to make bees angry, apparently, is blocking the flight path from their hives \u2013 which is exactly what I&apos;m doing as I stand there like a gormless idiot, savouring the scent of acacia honey on the breeze. Libert\u00edny&apos;s &quot;living bee sculpture&quot; will be installed on the lawn of the Natural History Museum in London later this month. Called The Agreement, this 1.6m-tall work is formed of beeswax and live bees; part of the Exhibition Road show, a science and culture festival, it will sit inside a glass tower to draw attention to the calamitous decline of the European honey bee. In 2008, the then farming and animal health minister Lord Rooker warned: &quot;Bee health is at risk and, frankly, if nothing is done, the honey bee population could be wiped out in 10 years.&quot; Later, Guardian journalist Alison Benjamin wrote a book called A World Without Bees in which she analysed the global decline of honey bees, a result of pesticides, monocultural farming and a phenomenon called colony collapse\u00a0disorder. Over lunch, a delightfully dewey-eyed apiarist, there to assist Libert\u00edny delivers a passionate eulogy in Slovakian to the honey bee. Despite understanding next to nothing, I find myself welling up. Libert\u00edny translates: &quot;Bees create 10 of the most important substances known to man, including honey, royal jelly, the bee sting, which has medical uses, propolis and beeswax. Bees purify the air! Birds and bears eat them! They pollinate 85% of vegetation on Earth! And yet we have made the world unliveable for bees. We must save them!&quot; Libert\u00edny&apos;s work celebrates their powers of construction. &quot;What I&apos;m doing is inviting new colonies to make their homes here,&quot; he says, pointing to the hives. &quot;They are looking to make a palace for their as-yet-infertile young queen. I make a light skeleton frame over which the bees regurgitate food I provide them with.&quot; But why would they do all this work for you? &quot;Because I&apos;m providing food and shelter for them. And they&apos;re eager to impress their new queen bee: the installation is a testament to love and dedication, but also to the tragedy of individual sacrifice for a better whole.&quot; Libert\u00edny started working with bees five years ago when he let the creatures swarm over vase-shaped beeswax frames in his studio in Rotterdam. The shapes they created were more beautiful, organic and natural-looking than any he could have envisaged. &quot;Modern consumer society is interested in slick design. I wanted to contradict that trend, so I started to work with a material that seemed vulnerable and ephemeral: beeswax. It comes from flowers and, in the form of a vase, ends up serving flowers on their last journey.&quot; But he didn&apos;t stop there. At Art Basel in 2009 he presented Unbearable Lightness, which consisted of a frame representing a crucified Christ over which 40,000 bees built a beeswax body, each cell of which they filled with honey. But there was a twist: Libert\u00edny introduced a dye into the food the bees ate, colouring the resulting sculpture red. This is the only colour bees can&apos;t see; it also signified, perhaps, the blood of the martyred Christ. The piece won Libert\u00edny, now 32, the fair&apos;s Designer of the Future award; museums, including New York&apos;s MoMa, began to acquire his\u00a0work. Libert\u00edny isn&apos;t the first artist to work with bees: America&apos;s Garnett Puett, raised by beekeepers, has used the insects to create wax sculptures of the human form. But Libert\u00edny came to bee art from a different route. He trained in industrial design at Bratislava, Seattle and Eindhoven, before establishing Studio Libert\u00edny in Rotterdam, much influenced by Dutch design in general and Amsterdam&apos;s pioneering Droog design practice in particular. He came to regard beeswax as a material that could counter the slickness and chilliness of modern industrial design. His work now straddles art and design. I ask Libert\u00edny if there are parallels between his work and Damien Hirst&apos;s, who has also worked with insects \u2013 in his case, flies thriving inside vitrines of rotting carcasses, or butterflies in glum momento mori currently on show at Tate Modern. Libert\u00edny says not. &quot;He&apos;s destructive when he works with insects; I&apos;m constructive.&quot;", "sentences": ["He trained in industrial design at Bratislava, Seattle and Eindhoven, before establishing Studio Libert\u00edny in Rotterdam, much influenced by Dutch design in general and Amsterdam&apos;s pioneering Droog design practice in particular."], "title": "Hive talking: Tom\u00e1s Libert\u00edny's bee art", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jul/09/tomas-libertiny-bee-living-sculpture", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Sculpture", "Natural History Museum", "Culture", "Science", "Museums", "Bees", "Wildlife", "Insects", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-07-10T13:30:31Z", "article": "Police are investigating the escape of a robbery suspect who was due to be arrested after a plane he was travelling on touched down at Manchester airport.

He also makes hazy ambient pop under the name Banjo or Freakout. He grew up in the Italian coastal town of Vasto, 120 miles east of Rome, before moving to Urbino and then Turin, where he fronted the punk-funk band Disco Drive. After they split, Natalizia became disillusioned with music, but he rediscovered his mojo after relocating to London in 2008, forming Banjo or Freakout and Walls in quick succession. He currently lives in Hackney. Buon giorno, Alessio. You&apos;ve been living in London for about four years now. Why did you decide to leave Italy? I came here initially for my girlfriend. She was living in Hackney and I was still studying in Turin, so I was going back and forth every two weeks. And after a couple of years of cursing Ryanair, I decided to move here permanently. How did you get into playing music? I&apos;ve been in bands since I was 14 or 15. They were typical punk-rock teenager bands, playing Nirvana covers and stuff like that. I was really into the hardcore punk scene. Was there much of an established punk scene in Vasto, your hometown? There wasn&apos;t really a local scene but it was easy to be part of a national punk scene because Italy is so small. I sound really old, but this was before the internet, so being into punk meant swapping fanzines, sending letters. Our band would go and play in Milan and their band would come and play in our hometown. Then after that I moved away for university, first to Urbino \u2013 the city of Raphael \u2013 then to Turin. And that&apos;s when I started to play in a more professional way. I was in a band called Disco Drive, which was a post-punk band \u2013 I guess you could say we were influenced by the Rapture and LCD Soundsystem. We released several records and toured a lot all over Europe. We even came to England a few times. So what happened to Disco Drive? I decided I couldn&apos;t do it any more. It wasn&apos;t really going anywhere \u2013 and I think that&apos;s a big problem for Italian bands. If you sing in English and want to make contemporary music then you have to look abroad for support. But outside Italy, no one really cares about you because you&apos;re from Italy. It sounds like a bit of a Catch-22 situation. It&apos;s ironic, because when I finally left Italy and came to London, everyone was excited because I was Italian. So why did you think Disco Drive hit a glass ceiling? Is it because there simply aren&apos;t enough people into alternative music in Italy to support a self-sufficient scene? I guess that&apos;s one of the reasons. Music is such a serious thing in England that you can make noise and still make a living out of it. Whereas in Italy you have to make a particular type of music to be successful. The Italian music industry is not really developed for good music, just shit pop. Also you need to sing in Italian to be accepted locally, and that&apos;s not something we were interested in doing. Music is for everyone, so why not sing in English, which is everyone&apos;s language? The government doesn&apos;t really help \u2013 there&apos;s not much investment in culture and music. In the end, there are a lot of reasons why Italian musicians often just stop making music and get a job. Is there still a decent infrastructure for live music?  Absolutely, that is the funny thing. There are a lot of great venues. American and English bands love to tour Italy. People are aware of what is going on outside Italy but we don&apos;t focus so much on our own thing. I think the Italian music press looks down on Italian bands because there is so much good music coming from elsewhere \u2013 and they&apos;re right, in a way, because a lot of Italian music isn&apos;t that great. It&apos;s a vicious circle. But the internet is starting to break down some of these barriers. When you moved to England, was it your intention to form another band? No, not at all. I was just writing music for fun on my girlfriend&apos;s laptop. I didn&apos;t have any plan to come to London and make it in the music business. Did the fact that you were working alone after years in a band lead you to produce a different type of music? I think so, especially emotionally. When you&apos;re making music just for yourself you don&apos;t really have any filter. With my previous band I was always screaming, so I thought it would be nice to try to sing, which maybe I was shy to do with the others in the practice space. Were you surprised at how quickly your home recordings as Banjo or Freakout began to garner attention online? Yeah, of course. I was making music for 15 years before this and no one gave a shit. But maybe my music wasn&apos;t good enough before and I needed to come to a new country and meet new people in order to make better music. How did you meet Sam Willis and end up forming Walls? I met Sam through Banjo or Freakout because he did a remix of one of my first singles. I really liked it, so I emailed him to say we should do something together. My initial idea was that he would do the beats and I would do the noise, although now we both do a bit of everything. Again, it was just for fun. We started to swap files on email and suddenly the first album was almost done. Sam was in touch with someone at Kompakt and they said: &quot;This is great, let&apos;s put it out.&quot; We didn&apos;t even think about playing live, but then someone asked us to support Pantha du Prince at Cargo and we thought: &quot;OK, let&apos;s do it.&quot; It was as natural as that. Being on Kompakt, you&apos;ve ended up playing quite a few club shows, as well regular rock venue gigs. Which do you prefer? They&apos;re so different. When you play a gig, you know people have come to see you because they&apos;ve bought the record and they know the songs. On the other hand, we&apos;ve played these incredible parties, coming on at 3am in Amsterdam. I&apos;ve never played club shows before and it&apos;s such a different world. People are there to dance and I had to learn that it&apos;s not all about us \u2013 it&apos;s about the combination of the music and the crowd. What&apos;s the status of Banjo or Freakout now, is it still active? Oh, yeah. Walls took all my time for the last two years but I just finished the recording of a new Banjo album today. In the studio it was just me, with some help from a drummer, although live it will be a four-piece band. In a way, you could say the music is closer to Walls than my early Banjo stuff, except with fewer beats and more words. Do you still feel that your nationality has a bearing on the music you make? I hope so. I&apos;m still 100% Italian. But what does Italian music sound like anyway? You can immediately describe French music, or American country, or Swedish pop. In Italy, it&apos;s always been split. We had Italo disco, or the distinct Italian prog music of the 70s \u2013 did you know Arthur Russell was going to make a record with Le Orme? \u2013 but these were all just periods. We&apos;ve never been able to take Italian pop music around the world in the same way we have with food. Can you see yourself ever moving back to Italy? This is going to sound like a cliche but when I left I thought: &quot;I&apos;m never going back to Italy ever again!&quot; And now, after a few years, whenever I go back, I always think: &quot;Oh, this is nice!&quot; I miss the sea and sun. This is a cliche too, but the British weather really depresses me. I can&apos;t stand it. So I guess eventually I will go back. For now, though, I&apos;m a Londoner.

But to those in the know, You Me Bum Bum Train is a theatrical experience unlike any other \u2013 an unpredictable rollercoaster ride of a show in which you are both audience and star. Performed by up to 250 actors for just one audience member at a time, the show set tongues wagging in 2010, when it was staged in the disused LEB building in Bethnal Green, east London, with the support of London&apos;s Barbican theatre. The reviews, though elliptical (critics are asked not to reveal details so as not to remove the element of surprise), were mostly effusive, and the show went on to win several awards. Now, performers are being recruited for a new version of You Me Bum Bum Train, which kicks off next Thursday near the Olympic site in Stratford as part of the Barbican&apos;s contribution to the London 2012 Festival. But a row is brewing. The performers&apos; union Equity is considering taking legal action against the company&apos;s two artistic directors, Kate Bond and Morgan Lloyd, on the grounds that none of the small army of actors and crew involved in the show \u2013 which costs \u00a320 a ticket \u2013 gets paid. According to a spokesman, Equity has repeatedly contacted the directors following a complaint from a union member, but has not received a satisfactory response. So the union is seeking advice about whether it has a legal case to bring against You Me Bum Bum Train for failing to pay professional performers the minimum wage. &quot;We are frustrated that the production company will not enter into meaningful dialogue with us about paying performers,&quot; the spokesman said in a statement. &quot;We believe the performers, most of whom are professional, should be paid. We also feel that as a publicly funded organisation they have a responsibility to treat their performers fairly.&quot; Bond and Lloyd are illustrators by training and came up with the idea for You Me Bum Bum Train in 2004 after running a club night in which punters were pushed around in wheelchairs. They deny ignoring Equity&apos;s concerns, which they describe as &quot;very vague&quot;. &quot;If we haven&apos;t been in touch with them,&quot; Lloyd said, &quot;it&apos;s probably because we&apos;ve been too busy filling skips. This show is all hands on deck; we&apos;re a very small team, and we look after every part for the show ourselves.&quot; They point out that the show&apos;s sheer scale \u2013 and its unprecedented actor-to-audience ratio \u2013 makes paying the performers and crew impossible. &quot;Our last show involved 450 people,&quot; Bond said. &quot;If we paid everyone at Equity rates, it would cost between \u00a32.5 and \u00a33m to stage. It&apos;s just not possible.&quot; The directors stress that every performer and crew-member is involved on a voluntary basis: no formal auditions are held, so the actors aren&apos;t all professionals, and they can leave at any time \u2013 even in the middle of a performance. They also state that neither of them has ever taken a wage from the show. &quot;Even if we could pay people,&quot; said Lloyd, &quot;it would completely change the dynamic. The whole point is to create an exciting, inclusive experience \u2013 for the audience and the performers. We have people taking part who&apos;ve never done anything like this before, and now they&apos;re thinking about performing professionally. We have people who&apos;ve given up full-time, paid jobs, just so they can be a part of it. It&apos;s really special.&quot; Eboni Dixon, a 20-year-old student actor from London, performed in the 2010 version of You Me Bum Bum Train, and is considering getting involved again this year. &quot;I came across it when I was on my gap year,&quot; she said, &quot;and I thought I&apos;d do it for the experience. But even now that I&apos;m training, I&apos;d still do it \u2013 it&apos;s an amazing thing to be part of, and it&apos;s not as if anybody&apos;s making any money out of you.&quot; She understands Equity&apos;s critical stance on theatre companies that don&apos;t pay their actors, but thinks the union is aiming at the wrong target. &quot;So many big companies are getting away without paying performers,&quot; she says, &quot;especially in TV and film. I&apos;ve been in things like Made in Chelsea and Street Dance 3D, and not been paid anything at all. The companies think they can get away with it because so many people want to act.&quot; This point about the increasing prevalence of companies expecting actors, especially those at the beginning of their careers, to work for free \u2013 and its negative effect on the profession as a whole \u2013 is echoed by actor, director and Equity member Samuel West. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen a You Me Bum Bum Train show yet,&quot; he said. &quot;The idea of having one audience member at a time can be terribly exciting for both audience and performers, and by its nature won&apos;t earn much from the box office. But no matter how good the artistic results, I can&apos;t support a working model where actors aren&apos;t paid at all. Otherwise the only people who can afford to be in those shows are those who have other jobs or savings or private incomes \u2013 and that alters the demographic of actors you can use, and eventually the demographic of the profession.&quot;", "sentences": ["To the uninitiated, it sounds like the sort of special-interest nightclub you might come across in certain parts of London or Amsterdam."], "title": "You Me Bum Bum Train gives actors a bad ride, says union", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/13/you-me-bum-bum-train-equity", "tags": ["Theatre", "Trade unions", "UK news", "London", "Barbican"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-07-17T09:42:45Z", "article": "From 1-2pm on Thursday, the director of Tate Modern will be in the hot seat to take your questions. Since April 2011, he&apos;s been at the helm of the world&apos;s most popular modern and contemporary art museum. He&apos;s put on massive shows by artists from Damien Hirst and Joan Mir\u00f3 to Gerhard Richter, polkadot obsessive Yayoi Kusama, art photographer Taryn Simon and most recently Norway&apos;s master of angst, Edvard Munch. This week, he&apos;s unlocked the doors to the Tanks, the world&apos;s first gallery dedicated to live art.  So you&apos;ve got him to yourselves for an hour. Would you like to know how he decides which artists to exhibit and when? Whether he&apos;s ever regretted putting on a show? What his favourite galleries and rising artists are, or his top tips for the coming years? How about how he reached where he is today? Where he comes up with his ideas? Or what about the inner workings of Tate Modern? Was it his decision to transform the Tanks? What&apos;s next for the Tate? Ask away, then don&apos;t forget to come back on Thursday from 1-2pm to see his answers, or ask even more questions. We have posted the questions and answers here to make it easier to follow: ChrisDercon says: Since the enlightenment we know that you can only get good answers when you get good questions. Many artists explore even the art of the perfect question, such asMarcel Duchamp, Ren\u00e9 Magrittte, James Lee Byars, Suzanne Lacy and Tino Sehgal.... there seem to be some perfect questions here! openears asks: How will you balance the obvious power the Tate Modern has in the art market and the need to reflect a broader set of art practices? Also if I may be so bold to ask, who are the experts on the African Acquisitions Committee and how can dealers who sit on your acquisition committees avoid conflict of interest in a small, tightly knit but hugely wealthy commercial sector that is the art market? ChrisDercon replies: As I said during my opening speech of Damien Hirst, the public museum is the pharmacy and not the supplement of the art market. We are asking... the questions. The artist and the museum are charging the works with energy and meaning. Thanks to the public museum artworks benefit not only from long term material existence but also stick in public memory. Long term memory and not short term memory. kebino asks: For a long time the new performance space was called The Oil Tanks and then they were subsequently rebranded as simply The Tanks. Does this reflect growing uneasy within Tate over the controversial sponsorship relationship with BP and Tate wanting to distance itself from associations with oil? ChrisDercon replies: This is reflecting the hard fact that our new spaces are not merely former oil tanks, they are underground spaces which reflect a publicly shared industrial heritage and form the foundation of a new and different museum. In the new spaces you can feel and see our new museum growing up. The new museum will be like a ziggurat, a tower of knowledge and continuous explanations. LyingScameron asks: I&apos;m too disabled to get to the Tate. Would you consider live streaming some of the performances that will be held in the Tanks? I know it&apos;s not the same as being present in the room to watch the performance, but it would be an inclusive gesture. ChrisDercon replies: Our programmes stand for the art of &apos;with&apos;. We do and present things with people. From The Tanks to Tino Sehgal and Olafur Eliasson, the Google Project &apos;Exquisite Forest&apos; and through Youtube, the BMW Tate Live journey , are all online projects where a multiplicity of people can enjoy works of art from outside the museum. Tate is exploring a new site - our virtual museum. Now already 20 million users are exploring the programmes and works which we have put online. We will do more in the future as new tachnologies are not diminishing but increasing the impact of the four existing sites of Tate. Let us know what you would enjoy the most? Here&apos;s an example below:http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/eventseries/bmw-tate-live-performance-room simonmacf asks: How do you strike a balance between attracting lots of visitors with big name exhibitions and bringing the work of upcoming contemporary artists to a wider audience? Have things at Tate Modern not swung too far in favour of retrospectives of big name artists? (Damien Hirst and Edvard Munch to give two current examples). ChrisDercon replies: Our programme is made up of the really big and the really small. We create a balance between the old and the new, the known and the unknown, and therefore we take programmes such as films, performance, debates and symposia extremely seriously. As you can see from The Tanks programme over the next 14 weeks at Tate, with lots of young, and not so familiar works, have also been turned not only by us, but also by you, into blockbusters already. But what does it really mean - blockbuster? We&apos;d rather talk about experiences which change the lives of the individual visitor. Whether it be the butterflies of Damien Hirst, or the light rays of Lis Rhodes. artist01 asks: Yes, I was pondering more on the current issues of what is happening in UK this year... James Turrell, olafur, McCall (whom I believe is on right now) only to name a few. Though to be honest, I may sound safe but I really enjoyed just taking in the simplicity of the water colours by Tracey Emin. Somewhat resonated with my thoughts for the first time... And how affective Abramovic has been with her crystals and quartz Performances and every one is happy. We&apos;re all looking forward to 2015. What made you commission Sung Hwan? Can you explain his art too? ChrisDercon replies: Sung Hwan Kim presents a generation of new artists or better to say producers of a new visual culture who work in many different places at the same time. Originally from Korea he studied in Amsterdam, produced work in Munich and currently lives in New York. He&apos;s collaborating with many different artists, exploring and mixing different disciplines, while always returning to the question - Who am I? Where do I come from and where do I go to in this complex global world? He talks and shows his family and friends in his work, who don&apos;t always understand his ideas or where he&apos;s going with them, but feel that because they are &apos;family,&apos; they have an emotional bond with Sung. We all need this kind of trust and support today. His work reflects the lives of many other young artists and cltural workers. His work is not immediately made for the market, it is difficult to show, yet he&apos;s being closely watched by the visual arts world, the film world, the music world and even the opera world. He creates a completely different type of art production. zibibbo asks: Why is there no work by the much-admired painter Jenny Saville in the Tate? Is her absence from your collections because you think painting has had its day and is no longer relevant to the new &apos;Tanks&apos; direction of the Tate? ChrisDercon replies: I just saw her show at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford! Our curators, including myself, go and see shows beyond London all the time. We don&apos;t have Jenny Saville in our collection, and indeed there are many artists not necessarily represented, but we do have and show a lot of paintings by other British and non-British artists. There are terrific painters and amazing artists around who practice again the art of drawing. I guess that by looking at the gigantic drawings of Jenny Saville, drawing is yet again a very important discipline to come. You see, this is what shows beyond Tate do to us. I&apos;ve always thought drawing is important, but this show brought it back to me in a new way. You discover the new or something you don&apos;t know yet. We believe in many different exhibitions and in many different places showing many different artists, especially beyond London. SakuraMilly asks: How does the Tate Modern support upcoming talent in the art world, not just in terms of artists but also more behind the scenes areas such as curation and criticism? What future plans are there in this area? Sabrinaosborne asks: In past decade Indian art has gradually established itself internationally.Amrita Shergil&apos;s was one of great projects you did few years back.Is Tate planning any projects with Indian artists in near future? ChrisDercon replies: Amrita Sher Gil was just the beginning of the Indian journey of Tate. We believe and have for a very long time that South East Asia has important visual artists - both modern and contemporary -which speaks to an international public. The Indian community in London is an extremely exciting public to work for.", "sentences": ["Originally from Korea he studied in Amsterdam, produced work in Munich and currently lives in New York."], "title": "Tate Modern director Chris Dercon live chat: post your questions now", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jul/17/tate-modern-director-chris-dercon-live-chat", "tags": ["Tate Modern", "Art and design", "Art", "Turbine Hall", "Culture", "Sculpture", "Painting", "Exhibitions"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-07-20T08:30:01Z", "article": "1) Denmark 9-0 Athens (demonstration event final, Athens 1906) It&apos;s 1900. In times yet to come, British football administrators would infamously cock their haughty snooks at the World Cup, the European Cup, and the European Championship. Myopic and thoroughly abject clowns we. But back in the early days of the Olympic Games, Britain happily takes its place in the vanguard of the world game \u2026 A Great Britain team competed in a demonstration event at the 1900 Games in Paris. Upton Park FC \u2013 nothing whatsoever to do with West Ham United, before Hammers fans try to claim a second world championship win for themselves \u2013 were Britain&apos;s representatives. The amateurs from East London beat a French representative side 4-0, before \u2026 well, that was all they had to do. The French XI then trounced a side from a francophone university in Brussels 6-2, after which everyone had seen enough. First place was awarded to the Brits, which shows you how far deigning to turn up can get you. At the 1904 Games in St Louis, another demo, this time won by Canada&apos;s Galt FC, who hammered two teams from the USA: a 7-0 win over the local Christian Brothers College, then a 4-0 victory over the St Rose Parish School. St Rose were then defeated 2-0 by the unforgiving Christians, scoring their only goal of the tournament, albeit in the wrong net. Two years later, and a third three-team demonstration, this time at the 1906 Athens Games. Denmark beat an Athens XI 9-0 in the final. The Danes only needed 45 minutes to complete the rout, as their hosts flounced off in a huff at half-time, and didn&apos;t come back. The organisers, rather generously and extremely patiently it must be said, offered the Athenians a chance to play off for second place against an international XI representing the city of Smyrna (now Izmir) and a music club from Thessaloniki. Athens refused, and were told by an exasperated Olympic committee to do one. The pram had been divested of all toys, but soon enough one of their players would have a new one. Within two years, the 18-year-old Giorgos Kalafatis founded Panathinaikos. 2) Great Britain 2-0 Denmark (final, London 1908) All of which led us to the 1908 Olympics, and the very first official Olympic football tournament. The 1908 Games were due to be held in Rome, but when Naples was covered in lava from the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906, Italy could no longer afford to host the event. London stepped in at the last minute to hold what proved to be a rain-soaked event at the 70,000-capacity White City stadium (which years later would make way for BBC Television Centre). Eight teams were in the hat to begin with: the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Bohemia, Great Britain (selected by the FA and purely English) and France (who entered two teams). Due to political problems in the Balkans, Hungary and Bohemia were forced to withdraw so the Netherlands and France A sailed through to the semi-finals without playing a match. That would be the sum total of good news for the French. Their B team was beaten 9-0 in the first round by Denmark, while France A were then trounced 17-1 by the same opposition in the semi-final, a result which still stands as an Olympic record. The French A team were too proud to play for bronze, so Sweden were given their place and lost to the Dutch. England&apos;s Great Britain team didn&apos;t rattle in quite as many as Denmark en route to the final, though they did hammer Sweden 12-1 and Holland 4-0. The showdown with the Danes was played in front of an 8,000 crowd and was won by the English 2-0, the goals coming from Frederick Chapman and captain Vivian Woodward. The Official Olympic Report, however, notes the scoreline &quot;rather flattered the winners who did not show real international form. Denmark, on the other hand, displayed the greatest vigour and determination with far more pace and dash than against France&quot;. For an amateur event, the final wasn&apos;t short of star quality. The British captain Woodward played over 100 games for both Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea, while Harold Hardman was twice an FA Cup finalist with Everton and later chairman of Manchester United at the time of Munich. Denmark&apos;s star man, meanwhile, was Harald Bohr, who in his day job was a mathematician \u2013 and has a theorem named after him. A theorem! He played for Akademisk Boldklub in Copenhagen alongside his brother Niels, a handy goalkeeper and winner of the 1922 Nobel prize for physics. To put shifting world views of sporting stars over the years into some sort of context, imagine John Terry saying: &quot;L(z) is the only function that satisfies f (z+1) = z f (z) with log (f(z)) convex and also with f(1)=1, you @*$!.&quot; 3) Belgium 2-0 Czechoslovakia (final, Antwerp 1920) For a while, it seemed the big story of the 1920 Olympic football tournament would be a shock. In the first round, Great Britain \u2013 winners at London 1908 and Stockholm 1912 \u2013 were expected to make it three from three in Antwerp. But this \u2013 a blip in the late Sixties ARF! excepted \u2013 would be the end of British dominance in world football. They were turfed out in the first round by Norway, and so went home whining about the &quot;broken-time&quot; payments other countries were making to their players in compensation for missing work. This circumvented the Olympic ideal, we cried. The fact that we&apos;d already been fielding players from clubs such as Everton, Chelsea, Spurs and Derby seemed to pass us by. Oh, us! How could we! Cue isolationist tantrum which would eventually see the Home Nations miss out on all three pre-war World Cups. But back to the 1920 Games, where the real jaw-dropping action occurred in the final between the home nation Belgium and Czechoslovakia. Robert Copp\u00e9e converted a penalty on six minutes for the hosts, then on the half-hour Henri Larnoe doubled the lead with a disputed goal. Nine minutes later, the Czech defender Karel Steiner was sent off for &quot;rough play&quot;. Czechoslovakia walked off the field, incensed that three major decisions had gone against them. They accused the British referee John Lewis of making &quot;distorted&quot; and &quot;incorrect&quot; calls, suggesting that he was biased against them as a result of a recent game he had refereed in Prague, which had ended with the whistler being attacked by the crowd. The fact that Lewis was 72 years old \u2013 he had been a member of the first-ever Blackburn Rovers team \u2013 and had latterly become notorious for struggling to keep up with play probably didn&apos;t help matters too much. Belgium were awarded the gold medal, but with the Czechs disqualified after their appeal to have the final replayed failed, a consolation tournament was staged to decide silver and bronze. Even that would prove to be controversial as the losing semi-finalists France had already gone home and could not compete, so their place was taken by Spain \u2013 who ended up taking silver. The Spanish goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora \u2013 sent off against Italy for punching an opponent, and an alleged boozer of the first order \u2013 celebrated by smuggling a ludicrous number of Havana cigars under his seat on the train taking him back home. He was arrested, caught red-handed when, unable to resist temptation, he hung his head out of the window and started sucking his contraband down. 4) Peru 4-2 Austria (quarter-final, Berlin 1936) Fifa&apos;s new World Cup \u2013 won in the first instance by the great Uruguayan team who had wowed crowds at the 1924 Paris Games and the 1928 Amsterdam Games \u2013 immediately took the wind out of Olympic football&apos;s sails. The sport was dropped at the 1932 Los Angeles Games, the Great Depression doing for athletic attendance to such an extent that there was no point staging the competition. The game returned in 1936, but what unfolded did neither football nor the Olympics any credit. In the preliminary round, the Italian defender Achille Piccini was sent off by the German referee Karl Weingartner in a match against the USA. Piccini refused to leave the field, beating Antonio Rattin to the punch by three decades. His team-mates rallied round, literally, by circling the referee. They pinned Weingartner&apos;s arms to his side, then covered his mouth with their hands. Understandably panicked and frightened, the official let Piccini stay on. Italy won 1-0; God alone knows what Alf Ramsey would have called them. Peru had made it past the preliminaries with a 7-3 skelping of Finland, lining up a quarter-final match against Austria, homeland of you-know-who. Austria went two goals ahead on the 36 minute mark, and were coasting into the semis with 15 minutes to play. But then the Peruvians scored twice in six minutes. Extra-time. The scores remained level until, with four minutes to go, Peru scored. And then, a minute before the end, they sealed the deal with a fourth goal. A small contingent of Peruvian fans ran on to the pitch and celebrated the impending win. It would be a costly jig of joy. After the match, Austria protested against the result, claiming the invasion had occurred when the score was 2-2, and that Peru&apos;s goals came during a period of extreme tumult. A jury of appeal, consisting solely of Europeans, ordered a replay. It did not occur. The entire Peruvian Olympic team \u2013 every single athlete, not just the footballers \u2013 went home in protest, as did Colombia by way of support. The German embassy in Lima came under attack from irate punters. Austria, meanwhile, advanced to the semis, where they did for Poland, before succumbing in the final to Italy in a predictably rough and unpleasant game. The 1936 Games did offer one moment of light relief. Germany had beaten Luxembourg 9-0 in the opening round, so Adolf Hitler went along to Berlin&apos;s Poststadion for the team&apos;s second game against Norway, in the hope of basking in some Master Race glory. Oh Adolf! &quot;The F\u00fchrer is very excited, I can barely contain myself, a real bath of nerves,&quot; wrote F\u00fchrerpal Joseph Goebbels in his diary ahead of the match. But the Norwegians were a decent side, and went ahead after six minutes. There would be Reichsteam. &quot;The F\u00fchrer is very agitated, I&apos;m almost unable to control myself,&quot; continued Goebbels. With seven minutes to go, Norway scored a second, at which point Hitler got up and departed in a funk. Humiliated, he never watched a match again. 5) USSR 5-5 Yugoslavia (second round, Helsinki 1952) The 1952 tournament was won by arguably the greatest, but certainly the most famous, side in Olympic history: the Hungarian golden team of Ferenc Puskas, Zoltan Czibor, Sandor Kocsis, Nandor Hidegkuti, Jozsef Bozsik and Gyula Grosics. It was a procession: Romania, Italy, and Turkey were batted aside. The reigning Olympic champions Sweden were thumped 6-0 in the semis. In the final, the gold medal was won, Yugoslavia easily dispatched 2-0 with goals from Puskas and Czibor. &quot;It was not surprising that, after the closing ceremony, we celebrated with some wine,&quot; remembered Puskas, &quot;though naturally in a restrained quantity only.&quot; Despite being outplayed in the final, Yugoslavia deserved a small glass or two as well, for their progress towards it was equally memorable. They scored 26 goals to Hungary&apos;s 20, albeit in one game more. They beat India 10-1 in the preliminary round, Branko Zebec of Partizan Belgrade scoring five. In the quarters, Denmark were skittled 5-3, the team taking their collective foot off the gas to allow the Danes a couple of consolations in the dying minutes. The Yugoslavs saw off Germany 3-1 in the semi, Rajko Mitic of Red Star Belgrade the two-goal hero. But the most memorable game occurred in the first round against the USSR, who had entered the Olympics for the first time and \u2013 with the Communist states at a distinct advantage under the amateurs-only rule \u2013 were hot favourites for the title. But Zebec, on fire after his opening-round heroics, scored again as Yugoslavia went 3-0 up by half-time, then quickly 4-0 ahead just after the break. The Soviets pulled one back soon after through Vsevolod Bobrov of VVS Moscow, but when Zebec scored his second of the game on the hour to make it 5-1, all looked lost for the Russians. With 15 minutes to go, the score remained the same, but then the Soviets embarked on a historic comeback, one referee Arthur Ellis, later of It&apos;s A Knockout fame, suggested was &quot;the most honourable ever recorded&quot;. They scored four in that final quarter of an hour, two of them in the last four minutes of the game. Bobrov \u2013 who also played ice hockey for the USSR and had cheated death in 1950 by taking a train when the rest of the team was wiped out in an air crash near Sverlovsk \u2013 was the star, having ended the game with a hat-trick. He opened the scoring with an early goal in the replay, but Yugoslavia came back to win 3-1. The favourites were out. Still, small mercies, at least the team didn&apos;t have to run the gauntlet of rotten fruit pelted at them by fans when they went back to the USSR: the result wasn&apos;t printed in any papers until after the death of Joseph Stalin, nearly a year later. And the result would galvanise the Russians into coming back stronger next time round; they won gold in Melbourne in 1956. Bobrov was no longer in the team, but never mind: he won ice hockey gold at Cortina in the Winter Olympics that same year. 6) Nigeria 3-2 Argentina (final, Atlanta 1996) Where, in some style, Nigeria proved both Pel\u00e9 and Walter Winterbottom right. Kind of. In the semi-finals, the Super Eagles faced the reigning world champions Brazil. With 12 minutes to go they were 3-1 down. First Victor Ikpeba and then, in the last minute, Kanu took the match to extra-time. Kanu&apos;s golden goal sent Nigeria into the final, where again Nigeria upset the odds. Losing 2-1 against Argentina with 16 minutes remaining, Daniel Amokachi equalised before Emmanuel Amunike scored the winner with the final kick of the game. Four years before the millennium, Africa had a world title \u2013 albeit not the one Pel\u00e9 or Winterbottom were talking about. But with the world&apos;s best strewn behind them, who&apos;s splitting hairs? \u2026 sadly also: Peru 0-1 Argentina (Preol\u00edmpico, 1964) The biggest football disaster in history has no place in a selection with the word &quot;Joy&quot; in the title. So it isn&apos;t in our six. But it did occur during an Olympic football tournament, if not at the Games itself, and as such is worthy of remembrance. Lest we forget. The Preol\u00edmpico, the South American qualifying tournament for the Olympic Games, was particularly tight ahead of the 1964 Tokyo staging. With the round-robin league reaching its denouement, neither Argentina, Brazil nor Peru had lost a game in the group; the top two would qualify, so it was nip-and-tuck. Despite playing the hot favourites Argentina \u2013 who had just thrashed Chile 4-0 \u2013 the Preol\u00edmpico host nation Peru were determined to hold on to their unbeaten record in front of their own fans at Lima&apos;s Est\u00e1dio Nacional on 24 May, four-and-a-half months before the big event in Japan. Throughout the first half the game remained goalless. But 15 minutes into the second, N\u00e9stor Manfredi scored for Argentina. The Peruvians ramped up the pressure and, six minutes before the final whistle, scored in front of a 50,000 strong crowd, who exploded in celebration, believing they were in touching distance of a place in the competition. But the Uruguayan referee Angel Pazos disallowed the goal for \u2013 that time-honoured fiend \u2013 &quot;rough play&quot;. A fan leapt over the nine-foot barrier and threatened him. Within seconds a shower of bottles, bricks and stones flooded on to the pitch. Fearing for his life, Pazos left the pitch, abandoning the game and declaring the Argentinians 1-0 winners. Outraged fans invaded the pitch. Police unleashed dogs and tear gas into the closed south end of the stadium. More than 2,000 spectators tried to flee, but with the gates locked in a stadium packed to the brim, disaster was inevitable. &quot;A few of the victims were fatally wounded by police, but most of the scores of police shots were in the air,&quot; reported the British United Press. &quot;Instead of restoring order, they contributed to the panic.&quot; The resulting crush killed 328. &quot;The pitch looked like a battlefield with missiles strewn everywhere,&quot; reported Reuters of the aftermath. On the streets outside, fans set fire to cars and buses and threw paper bombs into garages. One hospital alone reported receiving 140 dead bodies. A seven-day period of mourning was declared and the following qualifiers cancelled. Argentina were awarded first place, while a broken Peru lost 4-0 to Brazil in a play-off for second. Neither South American qualifier progressed past the group stage in Tokyo.", "sentences": ["4) Peru 4-2 Austria (quarter-final, Berlin 1936) Fifa&apos;s new World Cup \u2013 won in the first instance by the great Uruguayan team who had wowed crowds at the 1924 Paris Games and the 1928 Amsterdam Games \u2013 immediately took the wind out of Olympic football&apos;s sails."], "title": "The Joy of Six: Olympic football tournament stories | Scott Murray", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/20/joy-of-six-olympic-football-tournament", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics 2012: football", "Football", "Sport", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-07-20T13:30:00Z", "article": "Nikki DiGiovanni - national co-ordinator, ScrapstoresUK Know your waste: It is important to note that there are waste regulations which differ between household and business waste. More grassroots work: Running a social enterprise is hard often thankless work for the people behind it. The essence of a social enterprise is about social or environmental change and I would like more of them being run at a grass roots level. Scrap stores should be encouraged: There are 90 scrapstores across the UK, they support 74,000 community groups with art, craft, play, education and environmental resources. Collectively our resources reach 6.1 million children. The charity ScrapstoresUK was created by the scrapstores themselves to be a voice and to negotiate national contracts with big businesses. Scrap stores only take what they can reuse: Most have very little residual waste as they are usually a linchpin for connecting other waste organisations in their locality. It is also one of the conditions of low risk waste protocol we have with the Environment Agency, by only taking what we can reuse - we don&apos;t waste resources. Start-up or other funding: Register on Funding Central and you&apos;ll get an email each week with funding matches. Find your nearest Community Foundation as they process a lot money and new things are often easier to fund than existing ones that need core funding. Lots of banks and retailers have funding to give to local community organisations. More CSR must be encouraged: Currently scrapstores work with 3,500 businesses most do not pay anything towards the collection costs. This something I am trying to persuade them to change as we believe in developing these relationships for the long term and in a more cohesive way so that everyone in the company knows how they are working with us and why. Connecting with donors: Identifying them and target them. There are lots of free resources out there and even more cheap ones. For donations of furniture have a look at Choose2Reuse \u2013 a reuse campaign I ran with charity shops and furniture reuse orgs. All the lessons are available/shareable. Run events: We did &quot;inside out events&quot; in places where they would be most unexpected. Make sure you&apos;ve got some good signs explaining what you do and make people come and talk to you. Door drop flyers in target areas where you know people are more likely to donate. If you don&apos;t have the personnel to door drop most free papers will deliver them for approximately \u00a316 per 1000. Future events: We have some exciting things coming up including exhibiting at the largest waste event in Europe RWM in partnership with CIWM at Birmingham NEC. Check out the website \u2013 tickets are free. We are also looking to secure our financial future and have our national conference so that should keep us busy. Benita Matofska - founder and chief sharer, The People Who Share Van share: For those needing a cheap vehicle, rather than purchase a vehicle, access a shared one. Check out compareandshare.com to find one. There are currently over 100,000 car sharers in the UK and this is a great way to use less carbon. Funding resource: UnLtd have small grants for early stage concepts and also provide support, workshops and connections. We received a Level 1 Grant last year for \u00a33,000 and it really made a difference and helped us get started. Future event: We are running Global Sharing Day on 14 November. The aim is to increase awareness about the sharing economy, to inspire people to share in their communities, to help foster a culture where we swap, exchange, reuse, borrow, lend... We are just starting to sign up partners, let me know who is interested. Importance of networking: We also founded the Global Sharing Economy Network to connect people who are working in this area around the world. By connecting the different projects and initiatives and promoting them, this has helped in our mission to build a sharing economy. Reduce before we reuse: We need to reduce \u2013 massively. We&apos;ve already destroyed a third of the world&apos;s natural resources in our quest to consume. We are tackling big culture change that encourages people to access rather than own, to share resources rather than own them. The ideas around collaborative consumption are really taking hold and what we are doing is building a global network that connects everyone working in this space so people can easily find what they need through shared resources. Partnerships are key: Another great opportunity is the Innovation Lab are working in partnership with Peabody to bring together social entrepreneurs, innovators and the local community to develop enterprise skills and grow innovation. The aim of the project is to build sustainable communities. There is a great hook up with all of your recycling ventures for this project. We need to build partnerships across sectors to really get our messages out there. We work on a community level with our crowdshare activities but then engage corporates in other strands of our work. We rare currently building a partnership with M&amp;S. Their Shwopping campaign with Joanna Lumley has inspired people to recycle clothing and lots of it. High street retailers are able to reach the mainstream population in a way that if we were working alone we would&apos;t be able to. Utlilise space: At the end of the summer we will be working from a Peabody space near Victoria that has been a disused office space next to the community housing. We&apos;ll need some furniture for the space but I&apos;m also thinking about how the community can benefit from the various surplus you all have. This is an opportunity to put some of this to good, and much needed, use. Resource: Eliot Stock at www.ditto.do are free cycling and are looking to mainstream reuse, trying to make it cool and aspirational etc. Jenelle Montilone - creative activist and designer, TrashN2Tees Recyclables app: America Recycles Day is also November 15th- The Create Change Event correlates to an app that I&apos;m currently developing. The app will be compilation of creative tutorials-\u00a0 giving you recycling inspiration &amp; how to directly at your fingertips. It is going to revolutionise the way people view their garbage and inspire you to find creative ways to repurpose what we no longer need- injecting colour, texture, personality, and wonder into our lives and communities. Get the kids involved: How about partnering with youth groups, which collect and sell the organic and recyclable waste? Room for growth: General reports rave about recycling rates and landfill closures but the fact that 70% of the items in our landfills can be recycled/reused. More specifically clothing and textiles- Many people would be surprised to find out that textile and clothing waste takes up around 5% of our municipal waste stream. Of these items 95% can be reuse in one way or another, whether it is reused as second hand clothing, rags or for low-grade fibre products. Scaling to profitability: There is certainly opportunity for recycling social enterprise in America. The challenge is scaling to profitability and making them accessible to general public. Forthcoming event: I am hosting a &apos;Create Change Pledge&apos; event in November- with the idea that if everyone reused/repurposed one item for one day it would keep more than 3,117,956 tons out of the landfill in just the US alone. Emma Hallett - operations manager, REalliance Four main community resource and recycling networks in England: Community Composting Network (CCN), Community Resource Network UK (CRN UK), London Community Resource Network (LCRN) and Furniture Re-use Network (FRN). All are shareholders of RElliance. Big challenges: I would agree that there are big challenges out there now for social enterprises in recycling. While this could be seen as a success of the sector - what was once a &quot;niche&quot; activity has been mainstreamed. However, there still remains the challenge of how we recycle and the push to move up the waste hierarchy (reduce before reuse before recycle). Relationships with LAs: I think there need to be different ways of working with LAs and their waste contractors, and we are beginning to see some examples of this, including Bulky Waste. Multi-faceted social impact: The specific areas social enterprise has recently targetted are furniture reuse (including some\u00a0white goods), wood reuse and small scale composting. There are both environmental (wates/resource related) objectives but often also social ones of providing employement, training\u00a0and volunteering opportunities and low cost products to households. Job creation: This has traditionally been a key objective of social enterprises working in the &quot;waste&quot; sector. The FoE report looked at all waste management and found that if the whole of Europe recycled/ reused more, there would be a large net increase in jobs (about half a million if I remember correctly). Replicate schemes nationally: One of the challenges for us nationally is to understand what is working well and how it can be replicated in other locations. Localism Act opportunities: There may be some opportunities for social enterprise in using the new Localism Act &quot;right to challenge&quot; but it won&apos;t be straightforward and I suspect will be used only in cases where LAs are keen to see a change. Communities and shared values form bedrock: Some of the recent work by Waste Watch is very interesting in this area. They have based their work on the &quot;values and frames&quot; concept.\u00a0Basically they believe you have to start where people and on the topics that are important to them.\u00a0 Only by working to build a sense of community and shared values can you begin to influence resource related behaviours. Donation difficulties: One of the changes the economic downturn has taken is that people are holding onto their stuff for longer. While this is good for overall consumption patterns and reducing our environmental impact, it does make it harder for those who are trying to reuse what is thrown away. Waste industry key to social enterprise expansion: I think the opportunities that lie ahead for social enterprise (in England at least) will mostly be in the waste prevention and reuse field.\u00a0These activities are by definition\u00a0more labour intensive which enables social enterprises to provide social benefits too. A success story: Also one to watch not mentioned so far is the London Reuse Network which aims to make London as a city where reuse is easy, popular and the norm. That maximises the community, economic and environmental benefits of reuse. With unrivalled reuse infrastructure that becomes the international model for reuse management. Tim Edwards - integration and transformation manager, Furniture Mine Training opportunities: Although we&apos;re relatively new in this area we feel there is a good fit for us. Ours was an existing charity similar to many schemes of their type providing reused furniture for those in need. It fits us well as we have a substantial local training company PM Training where we can provide increased training opportunities through our project as well as extending the services to others in need Trading relationships: As grants have been squeezed we&apos;ve moved to a trading relationship which values the goods and services more that we&apos;ve providing, however the LA contracts for bulky waste for example are a useful contributor to the overall business model Scaling up is tricky: We need to be very clear on the segments that we can best work in. The larger mainstream contractors will have scale but we can provide local added value especially in areas such as training, community engagement and values. Our approach is to develop a cluster of activities with common support and stability to grow within a group. However, the translation into a sustainable business with capacity in the current environment is challenging. Robert Jones-Mantle - company secretary, Magpie Recycling Co-operative Create a drop-off space: Use empty commercial premises on the high street for people to drop in their unwanted items for others to collect, and if they haven&apos;t gone in a week use a recycling/reuse facility to dispose of them in as environmentally friendly as possible way. Offer free collection: And only take what you know we can redistribute or afford the costs on the risk of disposal. We don&apos;t allow an &quot;abandoned&quot; drop off as we vet these deliveries but do not charge if delivered in. When waste loses its label: There is niche where the waste can be owned locally longer in the life cycle. Examples are composting (strictly recovery, not recycling) but changes to waste protocols mean paper, metals and glass can lose their &quot;waste label&quot; and be products eligible for manufacture. These could be ripe for small-scale alternatives to the big waste recyclers out there. Firms such as May Gurney are edging to the fringe of social enterprise but they leak profit into the debt pond we live in. Focus on community: I cannot accept, in the current climate, a firm not owned by the community it serves as being a genuine social enterprise. It seems little to do with entrepreneurship when profit share distribution is denied to the community that paid for it. Paul Scott - social entrepreneur  I am currently in the process of starting up a small social enterprise in a &quot;deprived rural area&quot; with long term goals to bring employment into the area, reduce waste and promote recycling. Biggest hurdle: Insurance and start-up funding have been the biggest hurdles so far for us. I have finally managed to get insurance sorted out thanks to a rather excellent local independent insurance company. Almost ready to send funding application for processing. Once the paperwork is done, if the weather stays good I can get on with building the workshop premises. Successes abroad: When I lived in Amsterdam many years ago there was a group that turned old milk floats into human powered taxis with electric assist for when they were taking tourists out of Centrum with lots of luggage. Although it was not a social enterprise, and was purely for profit of the company, it did work very well. Catronia Fletcher, Freegle Resource: Freegle networks are growing. Check out the Freegle website. There is funding floating about for community projects that improve community cohesion and address local social issues combined with reuse initiatives; take a look at this from NESTA.

I call myself Guuzbourg and my blog is called Filles Sourires. Where are you based? Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Describe your blog in a sentence Me and my three fellow bloggers don&apos;t love women singing in French, we ADORE women singing in French. How long has your blog been going? Since September 2005. What do you write about? On Filles Sourires, we post music videos, lists, updates about forthcoming albums but mostly short reviews of new (and sometimes old) tracks by women singing in French. Plus anything related to Serge Gainsbourg. Why should people visit your blog? Serge Gainsbourg, a wise man once said, is one of the most influential pop music composers from mainland Europe \u2013 along with Bj\u00f8rn and Benny from Abba. Gainsbourg showed how one could tie low and high culture together in a three-minute pop song. The women he wrote songs for, ranging from France Gall to Cath\u00e9rine Deneuve, did not have Aretha Franklin-like pipes. But with their husky voices and the carefully crafted lyrics and arrangements, they made the listener picture an oddly coloured, decadent, sexy and/or just plain weird world. The spirit of Serge is alive today, in songs by lots and lots of French-singing women all over the world. If you want your mind to be tickled while you&apos;re listening to a song, come visit. What&apos;s your top song right now? T&apos;oubli\u00e9s or not t&apos;oubli\u00e9s by C\u00e9line Mastrorelli. It&apos;s on her debut album, which is out in September. It&apos;s very sensual, very well written and I just love that bass sound. It&apos;s a different version than you can hear/see here. The male vocals on the album are by the talented Joseph D&apos;Anvers.            Reading on a mobile? Click here to listen What&apos;s your favourite music blog aside from your own? Mordi&apos;s Blowupdoll blog was a huge inspiration when we started Filles Sourires. He posts mostly about female singers from the 60s. I&apos;m not solitary minded when it comes to music, I like soul, funk, Afrobeat, latin, rock and jazz as well. Rotterdam-based blogger Cortez is posting great stuff, so do the guys from Holland&apos;s Strange Fruit. German blog Any Major Dude With Half a Heart is interesting as well, Roy posts weird covers, great compilations and updates on deceased musical heroes. There are many, many great blogs, but I also like to mention Club Fonograma, a blog about leftfield music from Spain and Latin America.

From 1936 to 2004, they competed in 11 Olympic Games without so much as a sniff of a medal, although given that this is a country that has been ravaged by civil war, invading forces and the Taliban&apos;s reign of terror, that is hardly a surprise. In that context, with rather bigger problems to concern themselves with, you might assume that Afghans would not have cared too much about their paltry Olympic record. Not so. Eleven fruitless Olympics having come and gone, Afghanistan did not expect much from Beijing 2008. Little did they know that in China their sporting history would be changed for ever. Little did Rohullah Nikpai know that his life would be changed for ever. Born in Kabul, he took up taekwondo when he was 10, but his family was forced to leave the capital during one of the country&apos;s various conflicts, the Nikpais eventually settling in a refugee camp in Iran. There he became a member of the Afghan refugee team, before eventually returning to Kabul in 2004 to train in more prestigious surroundings. The training paid off and in 2008, at the age of 21, Nikai was picked to represent Afghanistan in the men&apos;s 58kg competition in Beijing. In the preliminary round, Nikai edged past Levent Tuncat, beating the German 4-3. Yet it seemed his summer was over when he lost his quarter-final to Mexico&apos;s Guillermo P\u00e9rez, the eventual champion. However a repechage was used to determine the bronze medal winner, competed between those defeated by the two finalists. Nikpai won his first match against Britain&apos;s Michael Harvey to set up a bronze medal match against the two-times world champion Juan Antonio Ramos of Spain, and by now everyone in Afghanistan was paying attention. Incredibly Nikpai demolished Ramos, thrashing him 4-1 to become the first ever Afghan to win an Olympic medal and even though it was &quot;only&quot;ronze, it might as well have been platinum given the jubilation back home. The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, awarded him a house at the government&apos;s expense, sponsors swarmed all over him and fans flocked to Kabul&apos;s Ghazi stadium to celebrate in a venue where the Taliban had once stoned women to death. After years of pain \u2013 both in the sporting and the real sense \u2013 one bronze medal represented a symbol of hope for Afghans. &quot;I hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war,&quot; Nikpai said. Now he&apos;s after gold at London 2012, although his reputation will surely not be hurt if he falls short. After all, Rohullah Nikpai is not one in a million. He&apos;s much more than that. He&apos;s one in 30 million. JS 2) Argentina take basketball gold in 2004 Maybe that should actually read &quot;USA doesn&apos;t take basketball gold&quot;, because for those Stateside, that was the really exceptional thing in 2004. The US men had won every Olympic basketball tournament since 1988. In the 2003 Tournament of the Americas, the qualifying event for Athens, they thrashed Argentina in the final. Messed them up real nice. &quot;We&apos;re the best in the world,&quot; crowed the Indiana Pacers forward-centre Jermaine O&apos;Neal. Even a heavy dose of pessimism could not have prepared USA fans for a mediocre group stage that included a pounding by Puerto Rico. &quot;After the US lost to Lithuania 94-90 last Saturday, Tim Duncan said: &apos;This helps our confidence because we played well.&apos; Has it come to this?&quot; wondered Jack McCallum, in Sports Illustrated. &quot;The mighty US spinning a message of optimism after giving up 94 points in a 40-minute game? Only a gold medal will keep men&apos;s hoops from being the feel-bad story of the Olympics.&quot; There was talk of root-and-branch NBA reform after an 89-81 defeat to Argentina in the semi-finals. (Normal service was resumed when the two nations met again at the same stage in 2008, USA winning 101-81.) Athens is a blot on the USA&apos;s record but it was not by dumb luck that Argentina won a first Olympic basketball gold. They had been picking up titles in the three years preceding the Olympics, including the 2002 Fiba World Championship, at which they defeated the US by a similar margin to that in Athens. They arrived in Greece as reigning South American champions and in their first group match beat the world champions Serbia and Montenegro 83-82 thanks to a storming first quarter and a last-second basket. They had two of the tournament&apos;s highest points scorers and its standout player, Manu Ginobili. &quot;This is the most exciting moment ever,&quot; said the coach, Rub\u00e9n Magnano. His successor, Sergio Hern\u00e1ndez, led Argentina&apos;s &quot;golden generation&quot; to another medal in 2008, when they won the third-place playoff. GT 3) V\u00e9nuste Niyongabo makes history for Burundi Sometimes sport defies all logic. The 2005 Champions League final, say, or Lukas Rosol defeating Rafael Nadal in the second round of Wimbledon this year. That&apos;s part of its appeal, and few athletes have demonstrated that more gloriously than V\u00e9nuste Niyongabo at the Atlanta Games in 1996. Niyongabo comes from Burundi, a tiny country in east Africa that was not even a member of the International Olympic Committee until 1993 after attempts by officials to gain entry to the 1988 and 1992 Games in Seoul and Barcelona had respectively fallen on deaf ears. These were immensely difficult times. In the buildup to Atlanta, Burundi suffered greatly, with the New York Times reporting that &quot;tension between rival Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups has left an estimated 150,000 people dead in the past three years.&quot; The report continued: &quot;There have been assassinations, guerrilla raids and constant tension. In late July, 13 of the 16 Burundian provinces were designated &apos;red zones&apos; which is a United Nations term that means one level above &apos;very tense&apos;.&apos;&apos; Niyongabo, a Tutsi, made his name in the 1500m, winning silver in the World Junior Championships in 1992, before swiftly making a natural progression to senior events. It was not long before several victories meant he was regarded as one of the top runners in the world, which was a remarkable feat for a competitor from such a troubled country. Indeed Burundi&apos;s lowly status presented problems for Niyongabo, not least at the World Indoor Championships in Barcelona in 1995. Arriving in Spain for the tournament, he presented his Burundi passport and was promptly seized by immigration officials and questioned about his identity for three hours. One phone call, either by the officials or by Niyongabo, might have established that he was one of the finest 1500m runners in the world, but in another fine moment for bureaucracy, that was not permitted. Without a visa, Niyongabo was forced to return to Italy, where he lived and trained, spending a night on a bench in Rome&apos;s train station before reaching his home in Siena. All of which meant he missed the race, giving a new meaning to a false start. &quot;I felt like a homeless person,&quot; he said. Happily a few months later, he had no such problems getting into Gothenburg for the World Championships, where he won bronze in a race won by the exceptional Algerian Noureddine Morceli, who was set to be one of Niyongabo&apos;s opponents at the Olympics in America. Only Niyongabo would not be running the 1500m at the Olympics and this time it had nothing to do with interfering immigration officials. Instead in one of the biggest gambles of all time, Niyongabo chose to participate in the 500m, a race he had never previously run in his entire life, which meant that his compatriot Dieudonn\u00e9 Kwizera could take part in the 1500m. Niyongabo&apos;s decision was thoroughly selfless, the veteran Kwizera having missed out on the two previous Olympics. Despite being a novice at this distance, Niyongabo made it to the final. It would be only the third time he had run the 5000m. In the final were the reigning Olympic champion, Germany&apos;s Dieter Baumann, the Olympic silver medallist, Kenya&apos;s Paul Bitok, and the home hopeful, Bob Kennedy. At the start of the race, much of the focus from the commentator, David Coleman, was on the Kenyans, Baumann and Kennedy, Niyongabo&apos;s presence largely treated as a curious anomaly; indeed with six laps to go, Coleman noted that Niyongabo was &quot;not showing at all&quot; and questioned his apparently foolhardy decision to abandon the 1500m. Baumann never looked like retaining his gold, but Bitok and his fellow Kenyan, Tom Nyariki, ran strongly, while Kennedy was pushing hard, cheered on by the home fans. Then, with three laps to go, Niyongabo emerged in second place and with two laps to go, he was in the lead. Kennedy momentarily pushed ahead, to considerable excitement in the crowd, but Niyongabo regained his lead and then, unbelievably, stormed off into the distance, his unrivalled sprint ability proving pivotal. Meanwhile in the 1500m, there was an inevitable victory for the peerless Morceli. The gamble had paid off and Burundi had their first and only Olympic gold medallist. &quot;It was not an easy choice, but the choice turned out to be so good for my country,&apos;&apos; Niyongabo said. Call it beginner&apos;s luck. When he tried to defend his title in Sydney four years later, he finished 15th in his semi-final. JS 4) Babe Didriksen on the podium in 1932 In 1932 a Dallas insurance company sent Babe Didriksen, the 21-year-old secretary who had been winning titles with almost embarrassing ease and along the way set three world records in two years, as its sole representative at the 1932 AAU Championships. The event doubled as the US Olympic tryouts and Didriksen (who was nicknamed &apos;Babe&apos; by her mother as a toddler but revelled in telling people that it was down to her fierce reputation on the baseball field) booked her ticket to Los Angeles by winning six gold medals. She had to settle for just three Olympic events because medical experts of the day believed that sport damaged women&apos;s bodies (this was less a welfare issue and more a crisis for marriage and procreation), and opted for three of the four events in which she had recently set world records: javelin \u2013 open to women for the first time at the 1932 Games \u2013 high jump, and the 80m hurdles. In the javelin Didriksen won gold with her first effort, which landed 19cm beyond Germany&apos;s Ellen Braum\u00fcller&apos;s throw to set a new Olympic record of 43.69m, but her medals in the remaining two events were far less straightforward. Having equalled the 80m hurdles world record in the heats, Didriksen was clocked alongside her US team-mate Evelyne Hall at a new record of 11.7sec in the final. The Los Angeles Games were the first to use photo finishes, but finish-line judges still had priority, and after about half an hour&apos;s deliberation, Didriksen was given the gold. A later review of the photo evidence showed that there was nothing to separate the two athletes. Hall, who kept a copy of the photo for the rest of her life, felt that it showed her leg ahead of Didriksen&apos;s at the end of one of the Olympics&apos; most controversial races ever. Babe was closer to the official than Hall and other athletes were adamant that his perspective, and the fact that she wheeled away loudly celebrating while Hall&apos;s friends in the stands silently signalled &quot;first&quot; to her, influenced the decision. There were even under-the-breath accusations of Didriksen celebrating so brashly because she knew Hall had breasted the tape. If so, karma struck in the last of Didriksen&apos;s events, the high jump. In the 1930s the scissors leap still dominated the event, but Didriksen opted for a kind of pre-Fosbury Flop. Tied at a world-record-breaking 1.65m with another team-mate, Jean Shiley, she was demoted to silver in the gold medal playoff for illegitimate technique \u2013 &quot;diving&quot; \u2013 despite the fact that she had been going over head first throughout the competition. Finishing the Games with two golds and a silver (at a time when the women&apos;s athletics events numbered just six), Didriksen was one of the year&apos;s celebrities, being named the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year. She relinquished her amateur status to cash in on advertising offers but soon found that as a woman, earning a living from sport was a bit trickier than that. She toured the United States playing exhibition events (including donkey-back baseball and playing the harmonica while running on a treadmill) before settling on an altogether more dignified way of life: she took up golf and was instrumental in establishing the LPGA. GT 5) Pat O&apos;Callaghan wins Ireland&apos;s first gold in 1928 As London prepared to host the Games in 1948, the Guardian mused upon the ecstasy in contemplating the Olympic athlete at his work. Who could fail to be transported by the sight of &quot;Pat O&apos;Callaghan swinging the 16lb hammer aloft, turning once, twice, three times, and even four, a whirling mass of co-ordinated mind and muscle, and finally launching the great ball so that it soars away on high and plunges down again to earth some 200 feet away, and farther than any man has thrown before?&quot; O&apos;Callaghan came from a sporty family \u2013 his brothers Sean and Con were also competitive athletes \u2013 but Pat was the irritatingly brilliant youngest sibling, who had qualified as a doctor while he was still too young to actually practice. He took up a number of sports but favoured hammer throwing, even making his own hammers out of bicycle parts to train relentlessly with. In 19 Olympics, the Republic of Ireland have won eight gold medals; O&apos;Callaghan got the first two, in 1928 and in 1932. He arrived in Amsterdam in 1928 as the national champion but could get nowhere near his best in qualifying, going through in third with 47.49m, a distance that would have been good enough only for sixth in the final, which was held later the same day. In the lead with his qualifying throw of 51.29m was the Swede Ossian Skiold, so O&apos;Callaghan put his psychology modules to work: he picked up Skiold&apos;s hammer and threw 51.39m to take the gold medal. O&apos;Callaghan became an instant hero in Ireland and his reputation was boosted even further when he went to Los Angeles four years later \u2013 having been asked to pay the wages of his replacement at the Department of Health while he was away, later being repaid from an expenses account \u2013 and threw more than 150cm further than the man in second, Finland&apos;s Ville Porhola. Again he struggled early on as his spikes caught on the cinder surface in the circle, but having taken a hacksaw to the soles of his shoes before the final round, he threw a winning 53.92m. Adolf Hitler was reportedly so impressed by O&apos;Callaghan that he dispatched a camera crew to Ireland to film him and other Irish hammer throwers training in order to analyse their physique and technique. In 1934, O&apos;Callaghan went to Hamburg to be filmed again, and to have his legs and shoulders x-rayed \u2013 Hitler was leaving nothing to chance in his bid to fashion German champions. Thanks to an argument over jurisdiction, no Irish team competed in Berlin in 1936, and O&apos;Callaghan watched from the stands as Germany&apos;s Karl Hein won gold and set a new Olympic record. GT 6) Lennox Lewis wins gold against Riddick Bowe in 1988 The past was a foreign country for Lennox Lewis, who represented Canada when he won gold in 1988 by beating Riddick Bowe in the super-heavyweight division. The significance of the bout grew over time, peaking four years later when the two failed to agree a fight for the world heavyweight title. The Olympic fight itself was relatively straightforward. Lewis hit Bowe with a couple of big rights in the second, at which point it was stopped, perhaps prematurely, by the East German referee. &quot;He hit me with three good shots, I&apos;ve gotta admit, but I was OK, clearly,&quot; Bowe said straight after the fight. &quot;I was even talking to him. I&apos;ve seen guys practically killed in the ring.&quot; For Lewis, it was a rite of passage. &quot;The gold medal is something that I have always wanted, having come close to winning it before,&quot; he said years later. &quot;The instant when you win it is a defining moment. It is like: &apos;Yo, now I have the gold ticket for becoming a professional boxer&apos;. You leave your days as an amateur behind and start preparing yourself to be a man in the world of professional boxing.&quot; It took Lewis a while to be taken seriously in Britain; it seems incredible with hindsight, but before a 1991 fight with Gary Mason, some were backing against Lewis. The realisation that he was the real thing came with a devastating two-round defeat of the dangerous Donovan &quot;Razor&quot; Ruddock in 1992. That was an eliminator to fight for the title against the winner of Bowe v Evander Holyfield a few weeks later. Bowe became the first man to beat Holyfield, but the fight with Lewis never happened. The WBC had threatened to strip Bowe of his belt if he did not fight Lewis; Bowe famously dumped his belt in the bin. There was plenty of trash talk to go with the trash can; a spokeswoman for the company that held rights to both Bowe and Lewis said they were &quot;getting along these days about as well as Prince Charles and Lady Di&quot;. Most felt Bowe deliberately swerved the fight, and he became known as &quot;Chicken Bowe&quot;. (Sadly for those who wanted to see the fight, such name-calling did not impact upon him as it did Marty McFly.) Bowe himself says Lewis didn&apos;t fancy it. &quot;He ducked me any way he could. I mean he knew, with me being champion, I&apos;m not gonna give him 50-50 [when splitting the purse], you know what I mean? So he used that as an escape. He knew he couldn&apos;t whoop me so he just avoided me the best way he could.&quot; It has become one of the great fantasy bouts. Bowe was a brilliant talent \u2013 the legendary trainer Eddie Futch said: &quot;A lot of big men can jab and some are big punchers but there are not many who are great fighters at close range. Riddick had all three&quot; \u2013 and plenty feel he might have had too much for Lewis at that stage in their careers. While Lewis went on to achieve greatness, Bowe, like so many in the fight game, soon became a sportsman with a great future behind him. His life started to unravel, and his estimated fortune of $15m in the mid-1990s dwindled to nothing. A couple of years ago he was selling his autograph at a flea market in New Jersey.

A fast start is required with fellow medal contenders Germany and Canada having been drawn in the same heat. Grobler, whose time in charge has coincided with the most successful period in British rowing history, is optimistic the powerful Louloudis&apos;s return will make a big difference to the rest of the crew. &quot;You can&apos;t measure it but I&apos;m sure, in the back of everyone&apos;s head, was the thought: &apos;What would happen if he was there?&apos;&quot; said Grobler, conceding the boat had endured &quot;a tough time&quot; this year. &quot;Of course it&apos;s a big thing to stroke a GB eight as a youngster, but it shows what kind of guy he is. At this Olympics I hope a new, new hero will be born. No one is too young or too old to do it. What gives me confidence [about Louloudis] is that he&apos;s a very confident guy. He knows what is required and what people expect of him.&quot; The men&apos;s eight \u2013 which managed gold in 2000 and silver in Beijing four years ago \u2013 also features the 40-year-old Greg Searle, attempting to win gold 20 years after doing so in Barcelona. Louloudis&apos;s return has allowed all his crew-mates to revert to their favoured positions. &quot;I&apos;m confident we have the right mix now,&quot; confirmed Grobler, encouraged by the personal bests Louloudis has been setting on the rowing machine. &quot;He earned his place, we didn&apos;t make it easy for him. Mentally and technically he gives the eight stability.&quot; Louloudis, who is studying classics at Oxford University, stroked the Dark Blues to victory in the 2011 Boat Race and also claimed gold in the men&apos;s pair with George Nash at the under-23 world championships in Amsterdam last year. The men&apos;s eight won two silvers and a bronze at this summer&apos;s World Cup races, but all concerned now believe the boat is faster with &apos;Stan&apos; as the stroke. &quot;I was always hearing really positive things from guys in the eight who were saying they wanted me back,&quot; said Louloudis. &quot;There were some low points but I never gave up.&quot; Among the other fancied British contenders involved in the opening day&apos;s heats will be Helen Glover and Heather Stanning in the women&apos;s pair. Assuming they reach the final on Wednesday the duo will have a chance to win GB&apos;s first rowing medal of the Games and are attempting to become the first British female rowers to win gold. The men&apos;s lightweight four of Chris Bartley, Peter Chambers, Richard Chambers and Rob Williams are also in action, having seen off the rest of the world in Munich last month. The Northern Irishman Alan Cambell goes in the single sculls, while Sam Townsend and Bill Lucas commence their Olympic campaign in the double sculls.", "sentences": ["Mentally and technically he gives the eight stability.&quot; Louloudis, who is studying classics at Oxford University, stroked the Dark Blues to victory in the 2011 Boat Race and also claimed gold in the men&apos;s pair with George Nash at the under-23 world championships in Amsterdam last year."], "title": "London 2012: GB eight delighted to have Constantine Louloudis back", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/gb-rowing-constantine-louloudis-eight", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: rowing", "Rowing", "Olympic Games 2012", "Team GB", "Sport", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-07-28T17:07:00Z", "article": " 11.26am: Good morning, and welcome back to Womad. This is Caspar Llewellyn Smith here, feeling just a little bleary after a 4am finish last night. In a minute I&apos;ll need to go and get some coffee, but first, here&apos;s what some others made of yesterday (including our own Kieran Yates, who&apos;s down here to record a Music Weekly podcast with Alexis Petridis, who should be reappearing on site today, too):  Dutty whined to some brazilian funk while you were all watching the opening ceremoney last night. #womad lockerz.com/s/228953409 \u2014 kieran yates (@kieran_yates) July 28, 2012   Camped, fed and now taking in the delights of the legendary Jimmy Cliff...FANTASTIC! #WOMAD\u2014 Judy Dawes (@AmythystThistle) July 27, 2012   Loved watching opening ceremony at #Womad music festival, with people singing along, cheering, gasping &amp; even standing for national anthem\u2014 Ian Birrell (@ianbirrell) July 28, 2012   That sweet smell of falafel and incense, g&apos;morning #WOMAD\u2014 Elizabeth Ward (@elizabethmward) July 28, 2012  And over on our open thread, which folk at the festival are writing (after being yanked into a tent the Guardian has here, equipped with various Blackberry devices on which to write):  I thought that this year&apos;s womad has been with great with good music good weather and an extraordinary environment I will hope to come back next year. Rich.A age13 and Jeremy. 46   Such an exciting and eclectic mix of artists from jimmy to the correspondents. Very much enjoyed the mellow sounds of Seth lakeman yesterday. Sian, 45  As for me, I only managed to get a glimpse of The Manganiyar Seduction in the Siam Tent, but it did look amazing: this being 40-odd Rajasthani musicians arrayed in a four-storey bank of small boxes, each one framed by lightbulbs, and looking like something from Alice in Wonderland (or even Amsterdam&apos;s red light district, which impresario Roysten Abel said also inspired him). The Finnish accordion player Kimmo Pohjonen on the same stage later was equally extraordinary; it wasn&apos;t just him but also a female vocal trio from Ukraine, who could compete with Grace Jones in a millinery competition.  The only other act I saw last night was Lo&apos;Jo, which makes it sound as if I stayed in that same tent all night, but actually there were a couple of trips to Molly&apos;s Bar on the fringes of the site as well: first to watch the Olympics opening ceremony on a big outdoor screen (which had the crowd of a couple of thousand cheering and applauding at key moments: the arrival of the suffragettes, also Her Maj and Bond), then just to stumble around looking for more sounds. Alas, Lo&apos;Jo themselves, by that time of proceedings, just felt a bit too ... serious? Right, coffee.  12.51pm: Good afternoon, it&apos;s Kieran Yates here, ripe from dancing to the beat of my heart last night at my first Womad festival. As expected, I can report that there are djembes, diablo and dreadlocks as far as the eye can see and on the way over to the showers I was informed about the dangers of dairy (full of chemicals), fish (endangered) and mobile phones (radiation) so am getting a real education. Last night I avoided the mass sing-a-long and deep ska nostalgia of Jimmy Cliff and instead dutty whined with the teenagers to some Brazilian funk, finding world music from one man and his mac, Maga Bo, who played a mix of beats influenced by dubstep, samba and jazz.  The other act I saw was Ukranian four piece DakhaBrakha which included accordians, furious drumming and deeply emotive nasal harmonies from three women dressed in black lace and huge headdresses, who roused a few tears in the crowd. They were incredible but more amazing still was being witnessing a live gig with a complete absence of mobile phones in the air taking pictures. Probably wise, bearing in mind the radiation.  3.08pm: Over in the Blackberry tent, more festival-goers have been sharing their views on the festival so far.  Totally loving Womad. Glorious weather, fabulous music and delicious food. Jimmy Cliff&apos;s rendition of wild world is a highlight for me so far.Gemma, 31   The Manganiyar Seduction were mind-blowingRose, 32   Highlights were the wilderness of Manertoba. Fantastic sound and really intimate and really funny. Carloud do was brilliant and was really cool. The song he dedicated to his mum was really gorgeous. Jimmy cliff was great and was great bouncing around.Karen and Chris, 42 and 49   Jimmy Cliff was fantastic, sang beautifully. Silky voice. Really respectful with the audience coming on early and played for ages! Lovely, beautiful. So tired but couldn&apos;t stop moving. Sam, 35   It&apos;s my 24th WOMAD in a row,I mustn&apos;t break the spell! Shame I missed the first six years... It&apos;s still fabulous experience of international music. This year I am looking forward to Nuba Noor from Egypt and Spiro who I missed a couple of years ago.Yvonne, 51 today!!   3.28pm: Caspar here again. Raghu Dixit seemed to whip up a storm in the Siam tent earlier, but more of a surprise was Patrick Wolf in the same venue later: all I&apos;m saying for now is that I really enjoyed him. Who says a world music festival can&apos;t open your ears? Now should aim to try and catch the end of Portico Quartet.  5.48pm: Hello all! Becky Barnicoat here. It&apos;s been a glorious Saturday at Womad so far. Impossibly, the sun has kept on shining and it&apos;s definitely created an added buzz among the punters. The novelty of lying in the sun, then scurrying out of the sun sweating and panting, hasn&apos;t worn off yet. My afternoon started with the slightly incongruous pairing of sunbathing and a set by Patrick Wolf. I sort of feel that Wolf&apos;s impassioned music demands a purple dusk and a rising moon, but actually his lunchtime session of &quot;depressing ballads&quot; (his words) and stirring strings, was a real pleasure.  There was just time after to grab a Goan fish curry, before we wandered into the woods for a lesson in the history of Malagasy music from Paddy Bush (yes, Kate&apos;s brother). My programme tells me that Paddy has been obsessed with Malagasy music for over 40 years, and today he played with the Malagasy music legend Justin Vali. &quot;Come in to the forest,&quot; said Paddy, in his lovely soft voice, sounding like an enthusiastic primary school teacher. With the crowd sat cross legged on the grass in front of him, he sort of looked like one too. &quot;We&apos;re going to go past all the animals. Past the lemurs, past the frogs, past all the insects.&quot; And up in the wooded glade by the BBC Radio 3 stage it wasn&apos;t hard to imagine we were really there, deep in the forest of Madagascar listening to Justin Vali play his beautiful ancestral valiha. The valiha is carved from an ancient bamboo, Paddy informed us, and only very few people in the world can play it. The crowd were lulled into an afternoon half-dream by its twinkly sound. I think we all wished it could have gone on longer than an hour. You can hear more from Paddy and Justin over on the BBC Radio 3 website.  Finally, I caught the last few songs from whacky Finnish accordion player Kimmo Pohjonen. Pohjonen is the sort of gothic Scandinavian I imagine you might bump in to at Roskilde festival, and he brandished his accordion with terrifying ferocity. The crowd were delighted, clamouring for more when he finished. It was a real spectacle, although I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d put it on at a dinner party.  Right, I&apos;m going to head back into the evening sun for some churros and chocolate and maybe a bit of Cornershop \u2013 although I can&apos;t remember if I even liked them the first time round. Time will tell. For now, adieu.  7.15pm: And Caspar here again, feeling slightly refreshed after heading to a stage known as Lauren&apos;s dad&apos;s stage - or Taste the World - which hosts cookery demonstrations by artists ... they cook; they sing; they sing for your supper, because at the end you get to try a bit. It&apos;s a ridiculously Womad concept, and yet one you could easily imagine taking over the Channel 4 schedules, particularly when the show is in the hands of Lauren&apos;s dad, as MC, and the artist in this instance, the young Cameroonian singer Kareyce Fotso. She and her sister (Anne?) made a hilarious double act; she indeed sang beautifully, meriting a comparison with Fatoumata Diawara; and at the end up served up some beans and plantain.  On which note, having succumbed to the festival to this extent, it&apos;s probably time to wrap up for today. Time for a beer - oh, and a gawp at Prince Harry, who is apparently here somewhere - and then Batida, then Khaled. Such is the plan. Meanwhile, others reckon:  Really loved the crowd surfing, singing performance the singer in the correspondence group refreshing get surprise.. Wonderful day.with glorious weather, to enhance the whole experience. Julia 50   Julie, kids world is wonderful! Lots of arts and crafts - we had to drag the children away!   WOMAD was ab fab!!!! Drunk shopping and messy reggae boogying was the highlight! Love it! XxxIsobel Watson aka Eddie 20Emily heseltine aka patsy 20   I absolutely love womad and this is the fifth time I&apos;ve been.

Successful novels generate imitators that swoon in their wake like groupies, copying style and subject matter, but rarely capturing the zest or freshness of the original. Literary agents must be watching for that deluge of Fifty Shades rip-offs on their slush piles like Pacific islanders watch for tsunamis. It is a rather better book that acts as the model for Dutch author Herman Koch&apos;s The Dinner, which has sold more than a million copies across Europe. Lionel Shriver&apos;s We Need to Talk About Kevin (2003) is still the best of a recent slew of literary works dealing with the impact of acts of violence on bourgeois family life. The success of that novel was driven by Shriver&apos;s cool-headed unwillingness to apportion blame between the evil son and his calculating, compassionless mother, so that the reader becomes a moral arbiter, forced to take sides in the nature-nurture debate. Like The Slap (2009), another novel to which The Dinner&apos;s publishers attempt to wed it in their accompanying blurb, ...Kevin was not a nice book, and left many complaining about the lack of likable characters, but the moral heft of the novel and the cool, anthropological eye that Shriver turns on her dramatis personae lifted it a cut above its companions on the bestseller lists. The Dinner won&apos;t win plaudits from those looking for saintly protagonists, either. It is the story of two brothers, Paul and Serge, and their wives, Claire and Babette, who meet for dinner in a swanky restaurant in Amsterdam. Each of the couples has a 15-year-old son and, we discover, the dinner has been arranged to discuss a horrifying act perpetrated by the two boys. No Columbine-style massacre, this one, rather a kind of extreme happy-slapping, where a homeless woman was beaten and burned to death, all of it filmed and then viewed by millions on YouTube. The Dinner bears one of those strikingly interchangeable subtitles \u2013 How Far Would You Go to Protect the Ones You Love? \u2013 which aim to hook in the browsing book-buyer, but in fact it isn&apos;t about this at all. Like We Need to Talk About Kevin, it is about the nature of evil, and the extent to which we can blame parents for the misdeeds of their children. The novel is narrated by one of the brothers, Paul, a former teacher. Serge, far more successful than Paul, is an up-and-coming politician and minor celebrity (I pictured him as Troels Hartmann from The Killing) and Koch nicely conveys the resentment and deep-seated competitive angst of brotherhood: &quot;He sawed his own wood for the fireplace as well; sometimes it looked almost like a publicity shot for his election campaign: Serge Lohman, the people&apos;s candidate... a regular man like any other, the only difference being that few regular men could afford a summer home in the Dordogne.&quot; As the novel progresses, we realise that Paul&apos;s animosity towards his brother is just one of a host of resentments that simmer beneath the surface of his narrative. It is not long before we guess that Paul is that most familiar of literary tropes, the unreliable narrator. A first-person voice requires us to enter into a pact with the narrator: we agree, for the course of the novel, to see the world through his or her eyes. This is why the unreliable narrator, handled properly, works so well. In a couple of recent examples \u2013 Sebastian Faulks&apos;s underrated Engleby and Henry Sutton&apos;s credit-crunch thriller Get Me Out of Here \u2013 the revelation that the narrator has been pulling the wool over our eyes is played so deftly that it feels like a shocking betrayal when the truth becomes clear. In The Dinner, the reveal is rather more predictable and pat, the reasons for Paul&apos;s duplicitous nature a confusing admixture of nature and nurture. There&apos;s one other duff note. The dinner itself is described in tiresome detail, its various courses presented by a sinister ma\u00eetre d&apos; with an ominously hovering pinkie finger and then analysed at length in Paul&apos;s narrative. The pretentiousness of the fare is clearly meant to hold a mirror to the corpulent self-satisfaction of its bourgeois protagonists: &quot;The lamb&apos;s-neck sweetbread has been marinated in Sardinian olive oil with rocket... the sun-dried tomatoes come from Bulgaria.&quot; But in the land of Heston Blumenthal and bacon and egg ice-cream, it all came across a little gastro-pub and tame, the descriptions overly windy and censorious. The Dinner lacks the weight and finesse of We Need to Talk About Kevin, but it is a well-paced and entertaining novel. It will sit well with The Slap and Christopher Wakling&apos;s What I Did (2011) on the shelves of those who enjoy seeing what happens when the cosy certainties of middle-class families are shattered, when the thin facades of decency and manners are wrenched aside, showing the brutal, violent creatures that lurk beneath the surface.", "sentences": ["It is the story of two brothers, Paul and Serge, and their wives, Claire and Babette, who meet for dinner in a swanky restaurant in Amsterdam."], "title": "The Dinner by Herman Koch \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/29/the-dinner-herman-koch-review", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Lionel Shriver", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-07-30T13:33:30Z", "article": "The world 400m hurdles champion, Dai Greene, gave an inspirational speech to Britain&apos;s athletes at the holding camp in Portugal on Sunday night, urging them on to success in the Olympic Stadium. The team captain reminded those assembled to be thankful for their place on the Olympic team and set the bar high, using the example of the distance runner Steph Twell, who will miss the Games through a foot injury. Twell, a former world junior champion whose exciting early talent led many to bill her as the new Paula Radcliffe, has worn a 2012 badge pin ever since the announcement that London would host the Games in 2005 and was heartbroken not to reach fitness in time. &quot;Use Steph&apos;s story to appreciate what you have and think about how she would give anything to be in your shoes when you get to the start line and use that to inspire you,&quot; said Greene. &quot;Set the bar high, don&apos;t be content with making the team. Don&apos;t look back in 10 or 20 years and think you wish you&apos;d done things differently. Aim for your own gold medal, whatever that may be.&quot; The speech was described as &quot;wonderful, funny in places, inspiring everywhere and meant a lot to the team,&quot; by a camp insider. As Greene joked: &quot;When [the head coach] Charles van Commenee called I thought it was bad news \u2026 then I thought he had picked me because I was like him \u2026 handsome, with charisma and I also can be hard work.&quot; The Welshman, who is hoping to win gold in the Olympic stadium, also reflected on his own journey to 2012 and how, four years ago, he was watching Usain Bolt win gold medals at the Beijing Olympics on TV having competed at a British League match in Derby that day. Van Commenee preceded Greene with a moving speech in which he admitted to having made mistakes in his current role, in what may well be interpreted by some as a reference to his troubled relationship with the injured triple jumper Phillips Idowu. The Dutchman said that he had thought life as Britain&apos;s head coach would have been a &quot;piece of cake,&quot; but that in fact this has been the toughest part of his career yet. &quot;I wasn&apos;t born head coach of UKA,&quot; said the 54-year-old, who reminded athletes of his own travails \u2013 from his days as a penniless coach when he was forced to hitchhike from Amsterdam to Birmingham for a junior championship and camp in a field, to sleeping on park benches and being moved on by police at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, to Barcelona in 1992 when he finally made it to an Olympic Games as an accredited coach only to be removed from the Olympic village after an outburst that left him watching the action at home on his TV. &quot;Our journey together has been hard and that is why you are such a success by being here. No one in this room has had an easy journey. &quot;Would success be a journey we would already be successful, but there is a job to be done \u2026 when you walk into the village or arena prepare for the opportunity, don&apos;t prepare for pressure \u2026 I feel privileged to have been part of this and lead you to a home Games, you can&apos;t get bigger \u2026 our success can only be complete not only if you&apos;ve travelled the journey but execute when it matters. The London Olympic stadium is your destination.&quot; Paula Radcliffe&apos;s replacement in the Olympic marathon, Freya Murray, said she was &quot;gutted&quot; for the world record holder, who has been forced to withdraw from the Games with a foot problem. The 28-year-old structural engineer, who has been a reserve for the event since finishing as the second fastest Briton at the London marathon in April, said she received a phone call from Radcliffe last Thursday updating her on her injury. &quot;I really appreciated her phoning,&quot; said Murray, &quot;At that point I didn&apos;t want to get too carried away, I thought, &quot;it might happen, but then again it might not. I&apos;m totally gutted for [Paula], I can only imagine how she must be feeling now, it must be horrible. Obviously she was upset but she was really positive for me, which was really nice.&quot; Murray will become the first Scottish woman to represent Britain in an Olympic marathon since Liz McColgan at Atlanta in 1996.

Robert Plant has worked with guitarist Justin Adams in the past, but in his new band, Sensational Space Shifters, he has cleverly invited a second member of JuJu to join him as well. Juldeh Camara, from Gambia, is an exponent of the ritti one-stringed fiddle, and here he brought a wailing African edge to a set dominated by reworked blues classics, with Plant proving that he still has one of the great voices with his edgy, attacking treatment of the Howlin&apos; Wolf favourite Forty-Four . The second great performance of the night came from Kinshasa&apos;s Jupiter &amp; Okwess International, whose hypnotic, high-energy playing mixed jangling rapid-fire funk riffs, and equally tight vocals and percussion work. They are surely the African discovery of the year. From elsewhere on the continent there were upbeat desert blues from Niger&apos;s Abdallah Oumbadougou, and a slick, easy-going set from Rai hero Khaled, who often sounded as if he was on cruise control. This was a great year for Asian music, and Manganiyar Seduction, from Rajasthan, northern India, provided the most spectacular staging for any Womad performance I have seen. Each of the 36 musicians played inside a box initially covered by a red curtain and surrounded by bare light bulbs \u2013 an idea apparently inspired by the red-light district in Amsterdam. The boxes towered high above the stage, with the lights coming on every time a musician started playing \u2013 until they were all flashing like some wild Indian disco, as the musicians switched from fiddles and flutes to a furious climax of vocals and drumming. From further east, there was the entertaining Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, furiously mixing Jamaican styles with jazz. And the strangest music of the weekend was provided by Marewrew &amp; Oki, reviving the unearthly and tranquil songs of Japan&apos;s Ainu people.

They&apos;re not there. I pour disdain on the mannequins in Harvey Nichols&apos; window, then stand in a dry place. A young man rushes out of the jeweller&apos;s opposite and leaps into a waiting taxi. He is George Michael. I stare at him and then realise he is staring back at me. I look away, as one does. The cab roars away through the drizzle. &quot;Oh,&quot; I think. &quot;This is going to be a funny day.&quot; Then Robin Guthrie and Elizabeth Fraser amble and scurry up. Robin and I agree not to go into the posh place. Liz keeps hiding behind Robin laughing with short catches of breath. We walk to Kings Road. It takes about seven minutes. Robin, kindly, talks. I concentrate on not positioning myself between the two of them. Now and again Robin says out of the corner of his mouth, &quot;Aw, come on, Liz.&quot; Then I brazenly take control of the situation. &quot;Do you think interviews are a bit silly?&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; &quot;What I find really funny is the way they always put \u2026 you can&apos;t analyse their music or describe it in words but anyway here goes: it&apos;s a radiant ethereal dooda dooda whatever \u2026&quot; &quot;Yes. That&apos;s true,&quot; says Robin. That was me brazenly taking control of the situation. I wonder what the alternative is. I am still wondering this when I kind of apologetically turn the tape recorder on. * We are sitting in the Chelsea Kitchen and all feeling much better for being in the warm and about to eat. Liz is acting less oddly. Robin tells me that in Simon&apos;s absence they intended to bring a cassette of Simon saying &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, and &quot;Four times&quot;, but they forgot it. I squeal, Oh, that would&apos;ve been brilliant!! They seem cheered by my enthusiasm. The waiter recognises them, pretends not to. They don&apos;t notice this. On the menu we see Christmas turkey, which Robin orders. I order it too, because then I can tell all my little friends I had Christmas dinner with the Cocteau Twins. Liz says, &quot;Would it be alright if I had two starters?&quot; Once, at the BBC, they were interviewed by somebody who thought they were Frankie Goes to Hollywood. She said to Robin, &quot;What&apos;s it like to be a fag?&quot; Another time they saw Johnny Rotten in a New York hotel bar. &quot;He was with that guy who plays Scully and they were getting outrageously drunk. Liz was wetting herself, man.&quot; Liz: &quot;It was incredible!&quot; Robin: &quot;It was disgusting. She was all giggling and everything.&quot; Liz: &quot;I know, I was being a twat. But it was wonderful!&quot; You don&apos;t think of yourselves as famous, do you? Liz: &quot;Definitely not. Almost no one knows who we are. Almost no one.&quot; Robin: &quot;Who are you more impressed with today, us or George Michael?&quot; Liz: &quot;Is there turkey in that?&quot; Yes, it&apos;s under the gravy there. Liz: &quot;Did you just speak to George Michael??!&quot; Me? Heavens no, I didn&apos;t speak to him. It was just weird &apos;cos you weren&apos;t there so I thought, Oh, I&apos;ll look at the street for a bit, and the first person that came into view was him \u2026 Robin: &quot;The lying bastard! He said we were getting peas and cabbage with this.&quot; Liz: &quot;Oh! Oh! I can see the turkey now!&quot; Robin: &quot;Never mind.&quot; Is your life now very different to your life two years ago? Liz: &quot;Yeah.&quot; Robin: &quot;No.&quot; Liz: &quot;It is. Money and things.&quot; Robin: &quot;Yeah, we didn&apos;t pay any tax two years ago and now it&apos;s terrible. You&apos;re gonna get the bad end of this tax thing. The whole interview&apos;s gonna be about paying tax.&quot; Oh, I don&apos;t think it will be. * We eat. The music in the background is I&apos;ll Be There by the Jackson Five. I feel curiously happy. I decide that when it&apos;s my turn to write about the Cocteau Twins&apos; music, I&apos;ll say that if you have a broken heart it makes you feel even sadder but at least a bit grandiose. Then I remember I&apos;m not going to fall into that trap. &quot;Come to think of it,&quot; says Robin, &quot;it&apos;s not even for listening to. If you read all the reviews and stuff, the records are made specifically for knobbing.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s music to bonk to,&quot; chimes Liz. Their Scottish accents add a richness to any humour you may think you find in this. &quot;Bloody hell! It&apos;s so cheap, so awful. And we keep getting these homemade videos sent to us. With all people giving it all this business, letting it all hang out an&apos; everythin&apos;.&quot; Robin: &quot;They&apos;re great. I&apos;ll make you a copy if you want.&quot; Liz: &quot;Every time it&apos;s got chests in it. It&apos;s got boobs and bums all over the place! How are you meant to react to that sort of thing? Are you meant to be flattered? It&apos;s sick, it&apos;s so vulgar.&quot; Are they sent to you by British people? Robin: &quot;Most are. There&apos;s been some Japanese ones.&quot; Do you get unorthodox fan letters? Liz: &quot;Not to do with anything like that! Is that what you meant? Hee hee hee \u2026 oh, but we do get some strange ones \u2026&quot; Robin: &quot;The average one starts off, this is something I&apos;ve never done before \u2026&quot; Liz: &quot;\u2026 I&apos;ve never written to a band since the Beatles. Since the Dave Clark Five!&quot; Robin: &quot;Liz, this is your big chance to tell all the people who send you poetry to fuck off.&quot; Liz: &quot;Oh \u2026 it&apos;s like \u2026 it&apos;s brilliant, but \u2026 no more!&quot; Robin: &quot;Can you imagine getting loads and loads of unwanted poetry?&quot; Robin and Liz live together. Liz suddenly explodes. &quot;There&apos;s just too much cutlery! There&apos;s so much cutlery! There&apos;s so much!&quot; Robin: &quot;What?&quot; &quot;There&apos;s just so much cutlery; I don&apos;t know what to do with it! Aw ha ha ha ha \u2026 aw, shit!&quot; &quot;Er, yeah,&quot; Robin concludes. I&apos;m intrigued. So I&apos;m laughing. Cats are not twee Elizabeth Fraser sang a hit single once; it was called Pearly Dewdrops&apos; Drops. She becomes very animated when, given by my brain a choice between the state of pop music, more sex and the supremacy of cats, I opt for the third. &quot;That was one of the most important decisions we ever made in our life,&quot; she says. Her man (is that phrase ideologically sound?) is less overtly respectful towards Otto. &quot;He&apos;s a great big huge tomcat, a real bruiser, y&apos;know? You should see his tackle, man, an&apos; he&apos;s only five months old.&quot; &quot;Robin! Please. Stop it. No \u2026 it was like gettin&apos; a kiddie or something. And if we had a kid we&apos;d talk about the kid all the time, y&apos;know? And that wouldn&apos;t be considered twee, would it?&quot; I talk for quite a long time about cats now, until Elizabeth says, &quot;What&apos;s the word?&quot; Robin suggests &quot;stinks&quot;. &quot;He&apos;s the most blah thing in our lives. Mega-naughty! No, I mean \u2013 we&apos;re really \u2026 it&apos;s all very safe and secure \u2026 sort of normal \u2026 getting the cat was the most dangerous thing we&apos;ve done in a long time. That was like \u2026 anarchy, y&apos;know?&quot; The Cocteau Twins comment on my interview technique. Robin says, &quot;Oh this is really great, this is brilliantly unprofessional. I quite like this.&quot; Liz says: &quot;They usually shout at you.&quot;  &quot;AS FOR the story itself, it was entitled &apos;The Dancing Fool&apos;. Like so many Trout stories, It was about a tragic failure to communicate. The plot: A flying saucer creature named Zog arrived on Earth to explain how wars could be prevented and cancer cured. He brought the information from Margo, a planet where the natives conversed by means of farts and tap dancing. &quot;log landed at night \u2026 he had no sooner touched down than he saw a house on fire. He rushed into the house, farting and tap dancing, warning the people about the terrible danger they were in. The head of the house brained Zog with a golf club.&quot; \u2013 Kurt Vonnegut Jr: Breakfast of Champions  Robin: &quot;Eat your soup.&quot; Liz: &quot;I think I will. Aw, I just shouldn&apos;t open my mouth, y&apos;know? Aw, it doesn&apos;t matter. I think \u2026 I think basically we know how stupid we are, that&apos;s why we don&apos;t do interviews.&quot; Are you well-organised? &quot;No.&quot; Do you like being disorganised? &quot;No. It&apos;d be really nice to be swish and have sheets of paper with &apos;Cocteau Twins&apos; written across the top \u2026 but it just doesn&apos;t happen.&quot; Robin shows me his chequebook. Liz: &quot;Look! It&apos;s filthy! It&apos;s all grubby!&quot; Here is what Liz, singer with a chart-topping pop group, thinks of football fans. &quot;The ones with scarves and shit? I love those people. They&apos;re so calm.&quot; &quot;Violence?&quot; says Robin. &quot;It&apos;s alright in its place. I&apos;m anti mindless violence. Y&apos;know, like the police \u2026&quot; Liz sucks in her cheeks. &quot;Ooh, you&apos;re so wicked.&quot; Robin: &quot;\u2026 But if somebody was to sort of \u2026 er \u2026 I wouldn&apos;t just sit down and take it, y&apos;know? She certainly wouldn&apos;t.&quot; Liz: &quot;I&apos;m a very violent person, actually. It really annoys me.&quot; Robin: &quot;We went to see GBH in Amsterdam. We went to get some drugs, but that&apos;s another story, we&apos;ll talk about that later \u2026 So anyway, we were walking up the stairs an&apos; this Dutch girl goes &apos;Ha! ha! ha!&apos; like that, so Elizabeth grabbed her hair and kicked her in the face.&quot; Liz: &quot;No, no, no! It wasn&apos;t like that at all! She was very venomous towards me. She didn&apos;t like me. She didn&apos;t.&quot; Waiter: &quot;Anything else?&quot; Robin: &quot;Apple crumble and cream, please.&quot; Liz: &quot;Do you want any of these?&quot; Eh? Oh! Er \u2026 um \u2026 cherry cheesecake, please. Robin: &quot;Ooh \u2026 I might have that next.&quot; They&apos;re not exactly aloof. We spoil it only briefly. I feel duty-bound to ask if there&apos;s anything they want to say about the two highly successful new EPs, Tiny Dynamine and Echoes in a Shallow Bay. Robin: &quot;We&apos;re thoroughly fed up with them now. Some of the music goes back to last February. We hate them just the same as we hate the others now.&quot; I bet you like the covers, though. &quot;Yeah, they&apos;re the best thing about them.&quot; Liz: &quot;No, no, the labels are.&quot; The music paper interview is, as you can see, a promotional device. The 80s couple Do you wind each other up? Liz: &quot;He winds me up. You do! You wind me up! You do hoo hoo! Oh\u2026&quot; Robin: &quot;Elizabeth&apos;s got some foul habits. No, no, not bad habits, not dirty, &apos;cos she&apos;s the cleanest, tidiest person in the world apart from Lawrence from Felt. She hoovers when I&apos;m watching TV. &quot;And she hangs things on door handles. That really gets on my tits \u2026&quot; Excuse me \u2013 what sort of things? &quot;Just \u2026 like a jacket or something. So you sort of open the door and some things falls off the other side, y&apos;know?&quot; Liz: &quot;There&apos;s no room! The wardrobe is not fuckin&apos; big enough man! Get me a big wardrobe, an&apos; there&apos;ll be none of that fuckin&apos; things-on-door-handles business.&quot; Do you still occasionally surprise each other, after all these years? Liz: &quot;He constantly surprises me.&quot; Robin: &quot;You could never surprise me \u2026 so predictable.&quot; Liz: &quot;Aw \u2026 one year I actually opened my Christmas present. &apos;Cos he left it in the room with me. He knew I&apos;d open it, and I did. Isn&apos;t that horrible! I cried. So he bought me another one.&quot; Does one of you sort of look after the other one? Liz: &quot;I think we both do our little bits and pieces.&quot; Robin: &quot;Yeah \u2026 I remind Elizabeth where she lives.&quot; Liz: &quot;And I clean up after him.&quot; Is health the most important thing in the world? Liz: &quot;Definitely not.&quot; Robin: &quot;I&apos;m the most unhealthy person in the whole wide world. It&apos;s incredible that I can actually walk about without machines and things.&quot; Are you style-conscious? &quot;Oh yeah! Look!&quot; How do I know you&apos;re not imposters pretending to be the Cocteau Twins today? Liz: &quot;You don&apos;t.&quot; Robin lifts up the sleeve of Liz&apos;s inside-out Fall T-shirt to expose her tattoo. Liz: &quot;You sonovabitch! Don&apos;t you do that!&quot; Robin: &quot;I&apos;m as close to being realistic as the two of us will ever get. She&apos;s definitely not. She&apos;s got her feet firmly screwed six feet above the ground.&quot; Liz: &quot;What does that mean?&quot; Robin: &quot;It means you&apos;re a bit of a screwball, dunnit?&quot; Liz: &quot;Noooo \u2026&quot; Robin: &quot;It means you&apos;ve got your head in the clouds and you don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on from one day to the next.&quot; Liz: &quot;I should&apos;ve thought that was very sensible of me. Leave it all up to you. This is his part of the relationship, you know. He carries me. You carry me, Robin. Ha ha!&quot; Robin: &quot;I don&apos;t think that&apos;s possible.&quot; Liz: &quot;Ha ha ha! No. Y&apos;know \u2026 y&apos;know \u2026 I&apos;m just not meant to know those sort of things.&quot; Elizabeth&apos;s New Year resolution will be to be less bad-tempered, while Robin&apos;s will be to contradict himself more often, and maybe to stop wearing pointy shoes, though Liz doubts this. However! They are busy recording a new LP, just the two of them, with just guitars and voice. I expect this will sound very special. &quot;It&apos;s wonderful,&quot; says Liz. &quot;It&apos;s like going on our second honeymoon.&quot; Do you get depressed if things aren&apos;t meaningful? Robin: &quot;I don&apos;t know what you mean.&quot; Do you feel better for having eaten? Liz: &quot;It definitely makes you feel a bit more human, doesn&apos;t it?&quot; * &quot;Och, Robin, that&apos;s the C word. I never say the C word. Do you say the C word?&quot; Er \u2026 yeah I do, yeah. &quot;Ooh, do you?!?&quot; But I try not to say it in front of ladies because of my conditioning. Robin: &quot;Yeah, they don&apos;t like it at all.&quot; Liz: &quot;Yes, I wonder why that is. I must be just the \u2026 sort of \u2026 I mean \u2026 I dunno \u2026 I think it&apos;s just because it&apos;s sort of \u2026 some women say all sorts of terrible things. I&apos;m really bad but I still can&apos;t say the C word.&quot; * Robin&apos;s birthday is January 4. Liz says Otto&apos;s been less vicious this week, because of the trouble with his teeth. Robin just spent a ridiculous amount of money on monitors for their new studio, which made him feel ever so good. On Treasure, there&apos;s a refrain which I think says &quot;Here&apos;s what it takes&quot;. I could be wrong. It doesn&apos;t matter. Fantastic and high. Liz: &quot;That&apos;s what you do. That&apos;s what people do to each other all the time, don&apos;t they? They just misunderstand each other all the time, it&apos;s terrible.&quot; But she is abandoned to laughter. The Cocteau Twins are very happy. A New Year. Right. The woman whose voice is the ghost of Helen of Troy if you want it to be says, &quot;Look, I&apos;ve got to buy some shoes.&quot;", "sentences": ["It really annoys me.&quot; Robin: &quot;We went to see GBH in Amsterdam."], "title": "Cocteau Twins: 'It's music to bonk to' \u2013 a classic interview from the vaults", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/31/cocteau-twins-classic-interview", "tags": ["Meltdown festival", "Indie", "Festivals", "Music", "Culture", "Music festivals"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-01T15:01:04Z", "article": "Stand aside, Sir Steve Redgrave. Step forward, Colonel Wiggo, as the French started calling him during the Tour de France. Or Sir Bradley, as we will surely come to know him before long, if recent precedent is any guide. Wednesday&apos;s gold in the men&apos;s time trial makes Bradley Wiggins officially the most successful British athlete in 116 years of modern Olympic history. If you believe in that sort of thing, of course. No rational person could seriously imagine that it is possible to make an exact comparison between the efforts of an oarsman and those of a cyclist. Or between the exponents of any two separate sporting disciplines. But still, as he hissed towards the finish line through the avenue of horse chestnut trees alongside the wall of Hampton Court Palace in Wednesday afternoon&apos;s belated burst of sunshine, Wiggins was taking his aggregate of Olympics medals to seven, more than any other Briton: four golds, one silver and two bronze, compared with Redgrave&apos;s five golds and one bronze. The great oarsman won his gold medals at five consecutive Games, from 1984 in Los Angeles to 2000 in Sydney, an achievement simply beyond compare. His bronze came in Seoul in 1988. Wiggins&apos;s run of success started just as Redgrave&apos;s was ending, in Sydney, with a bronze in the team pursuit. Four years later in Athens he upgraded to silver in the same event and won his first gold in the 4km individual pursuit, adding a bronze in the Madison. In Beijing he repeated his success in the 4km individual pursuit, also taking gold with the team pursuit squad \u2013 in a final during which they shattered their own world record. Had he not been too drained by those exertions to put his normal effort into the Madison with Mark Cavendish, he might have surpassed Redgrave&apos;s total there and then, instead of having to wait until Wednesday. As if becoming the first Briton to win the Tour de France were not enough for one summer, Wiggins has made this an extraordinary year by any bike racer&apos;s standards. Before the Tour he achieved a run of stage-race victories in Paris-Nice, the Tour de Romandie and the Dauphin\u00e9, something no rider of any nationality had done before. In earlier eras, before the cycle of success kicked into high gear, that alone would have been enough to earn him a place in British cycling&apos;s Valhalla. Now, in the space of 10 days, he has won the yellow jersey, the most coveted prize in cycling, and an Olympic gold medal in the city where he grew up. Before Wednesday, Britain&apos;s best performances in the Olympic men&apos;s time trial were the silver medals won by two legendary riders: Freddie Grubb in Stockholm in 1912 and Frank Southall in Amsterdam in 1928. Grubb was born in Kingston upon Thames, through whose old town centre Wiggins raced on his way to Wednesday&apos;s triumph, and where he ran into a wall of sound that he will never forget. &quot;Coming round the roundabout in Kingston,&quot; he said, &quot;the noise was incredible. I&apos;m never going to experience anything like that again in my career.&quot; As soon as he rolled off the starting ramp, the last but one of the 37 riders, and headed through the gateway of Hampton Court Palace before turning across the bridge over the Thames, he was surfing a wave of noise that lasted for 44 kilometres and just over 50 minutes. All the riders, the obscure as well as the famous, were applauded by a generous and knowledgeable crowd as they set off at 90-second intervals, but for Wiggins there was a special reception. Within the first 500 metres, on the pavement outside an Italian restaurant, four young men stood with the letters B, R, A and D painted on their bare chests. Football and rugby-style chants were taken up: &quot;Wiggy-Wiggy-Wiggy Oy-Oy-Oy!&quot; and &quot;Bring on the Wiggins!&quot; The afternoon had started out dull and grey but by the time Wiggins hit the track the sun had come out. Just over an hour later, as the great wooden doors opened in the Tudor facade of the Palace and he emerged \u2013 flanked by Tony Martin and Chris Froome, the silver and bronze medal winners \u2013 to take his place on the podium, the sunlight was as brilliant as it had been when he accepted the cheers of the crowd on the Champs Elys\u00e9es. Ten days ago he became the most popular man in Britain. Now he is a British sporting legend. And one who will not get carried away by the notion of a knighthood. &quot;It doesn&apos;t sound right,&quot; he said when asked about the possibility. &quot;As much of an honour as it would be to get something like that, I don&apos;t think I&apos;d use it. I&apos;d just put it away in a drawer. I&apos;ll always be Brad.&quot; Of course if you really want to make a comparison between Wiggins and Redgrave that puts the cyclist at an advantage, you could say that he has achieved his Olympic success in two disciplines: in the velodrome and on the road. He was proud of his versatility, he said last night. &quot;A lot of people don&apos;t pick up on it, but it&apos;s nice to be a good all-rounder.&quot; For Redgrave to have achieved something similar, he would have needed to win gold in, say, the white-water canoeing as well as on the rowing lake. And, outside the Olympic sphere, perhaps matched Wiggins&apos;s Tour win by stroking the winner of the Grand Eights at Henley. But no one would be stupid enough to suggest such a thing. Just enjoy Wiggins for what he is, an ordinary man doing extraordinary things. Exactly like Redgrave.", "sentences": ["Before Wednesday, Britain&apos;s best performances in the Olympic men&apos;s time trial were the silver medals won by two legendary riders: Freddie Grubb in Stockholm in 1912 and Frank Southall in Amsterdam in 1928."], "title": "Bradley Wiggins wins Olympic gold and powers into British record books | Richard Williams", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/01/bradley-wiggins-olympic-gold", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: cycling", "Olympic Games 2012", "Team GB Olympic gold", "Team GB Olympic medals", "Cycling", "Team GB", "Sport", "London 2012 Olympic gold", "London 2012 Olympic medals"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-02T13:59:11Z", "article": "The Internationaal Danstheater had been bracing itself for bad news. In the end, its worst fears were realised. On Wednesday, the Netherlands&apos; Performing Arts Fund, which administers government funding to the fields of dance, theatre and music, announced its allocations and the Amsterdam-based theatre was left empty-handed. The theatre, which for the past 50 years has specialised in dance productions that focus on different world cultures, had applied for \u20ac900,000 (\u00a3710,000), far less than the \u20ac2.8m budget it was previously allocated. However, on Wednesday it found out that it was getting no public subsidy at all. The drastic cut was part of a Dutch government decision taken last year to slash the culture budget of \u20ac800m by 25 %. As a result, from the start of 2013, countless theatres, museums and orchestras will see their funding either severely curtailed or, like the Internationaal Danstheater, cut off altogether. For the theatre, which typically attracts audiences of around 80,000 people a year, the pulling of the plug feels premature, as the company has only just embarked on a significant restructuring, instigated by the same arts fund. &quot;It was a surprise,&quot; says the theatre&apos;s managing director, Sophie Lambo, &quot;because we have been working together with the fund to renew the theatre as a company.&quot; It had already cut staff from 54 employees to just three, with dancers and musicians only hired on a freelance basis for individual projects. Lambo argues that since she and the new artistic director, Jan Linkens, have only been in their jobs for 18 months, they should be judged on the forthcoming, more contemporary, season. She says the theatre should be able survive for the next couple of years, thanks to partnerships with other companies and a more commercial programme. Her intention is to then go back to the Performing Arts Fund to show how the theatre&apos;s vision has evolved. In particular, Lambo complains about the speed with which the government has pushed through the cuts, making it particularly difficult for the arts world to adjust or find sponsors. Of the 118 performing arts organisations in the Netherlands, around 70 will get no public funding at all. Lambo says this will mean that the Dutch arts will lose a lot of diversity, with the more experimental and avant-garde organisations struggling to survive. &quot;I think that the companies that are not subsidised and don&apos;t have partners, will already start to shut down their businesses this year.&quot;", "sentences": ["On Wednesday, the Netherlands&apos; Performing Arts Fund, which administers government funding to the fields of dance, theatre and music, announced its allocations and the Amsterdam-based theatre was left empty-handed."], "title": "European arts cuts: Dutch dance loses out as Netherlands slashes funding", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/02/european-arts-cuts-dutch-dance", "tags": ["Arts funding", "Culture", "Dance", "Stage", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-06T15:20:00Z", "article": "Jonny Bauer, chief strategy officer, Droga5     Jonny Bauer    Jonny is responsible for building the strategic function at Droga5 from the ground up, and oversees all brand, digital, media and IP thinking for the agency.

If all these people are going to have enough to eat, increases in food production and changes in consumer patterns of behaviour will both be needed. But what will these look like? And what&apos;s the best way to make them happen? To discuss these questions, Guardian Sustainable Business brought together a range of experts from across the food security and sustainable agriculture debate. The online panel included Richard Perkins, senior commodities adviser at environment charity WWF; Dawn Rittenhouse, director of sustainabilty for US chemicals firm DuPont; Louise Fresco, a sustainability expert at the University of Amsterdam; Justin Smith, head of sustainability at South African retailer Woolworths; Santiago del Solar, an Argentine agronomist and farmer; and Jan Kees Vis, global director sustainable sourcing development at consumer goods firm Unilever. Here&apos;s a summary of the six main themes: Sharing knowledge There&apos;s no one &quot;right&quot; model for farming. Farmers need to respond to local conditions, argued Louise Fresco of the University of Amsterdam. &quot;Farmers and business should liaise with communities to orient \u2026 production&quot;, she pointed out. By the same token, farmers have a lot to learn from one another. Knowledge gaps are especially significant in the developing world, where tomorrow&apos;s hungry mouths will mostly be found. Why are rice yields so much lower in India than China, for example? So there&apos;s a strong case for sharing best practices. Yet warnings were voiced against imposing outside recommendations wholesale. As debate participant Robynne Anderson observed: &quot;scaling up in a farmer context is often best done through farmer organisations and extension services.&quot; Measuring performance Okay, so it might not sound like the most thrilling solution, but data matters. We can&apos;t analyse the problem without the right numbers. DuPont&apos;s Dawn Rittenhouse pointed towards a US programme called Field to Market that has devised comparable outcome metrics for agricultural improvement projects. Woolworths is rolling out a similar approach across its agriculture suppliers. Farming for the Future operates within an 80-point audit protocol based on soil health. It&apos;s proven effective at &quot;reducing inputs, driving water efficiency, protecting biodiversity and maintaining or even growing yields&quot;, Justin Smith remarked. A word of caution, however: adding to producers&apos; paperwork won&apos;t be welcomed down on the farm. There&apos;s a multitude of certification schemes out there already: Tesco Nurture, Leaf, Organic, Freedom Food, and so forth. &quot;Too many standards, too many questions to farmers&quot;, noted Unilever&apos;s Jan Kees Vis. Better to have one harmonised standard \u2013 albeit it&apos;s difficult to draw up. Keeping it local \u2013 or not The trope of our times - Think global, Act local \u2013 drew mixed responses. Received wisdom is that food miles are bad news. If we need to feed the world, we need to grow what we need on our doorsteps. Yet analysis by Unilever suggests only 2-3% of the global carbon footprint of your average food product comes from transport. WWF&apos;s Perkins conceded that the case for going local isn&apos;t as easy as it sounds. Sure, we want to avoid air-freighting food around the globe, but we also don&apos;t want to be growing carbon-heavy, out-of-season greenhouse crops just so that they are local. Instead, he suggested that it made sense to &quot;grow things where they grow best \u2026 and trade them&quot;. Reducing waste Feeding 9 billion people by 2050 doesn&apos;t necessarily mean a revolution in agricultural productivity. Simply stopping waste in the food chain will get us a good way towards where we need to be. There&apos;s much to be done at the producer end, particularly with respect to post-harvest loses. DuPont&apos;s Dawn Rittenhouse cites the example of dairy farming in Kenya. Her company co-developed a new enzyme that slowed the spoilage of milk, thus preserving milk during transportation from the farm. Information technology can also play a role. Participants cited IT innovations like #phones4farmers and iCow. Not all solutions need be high tech. Grain farmer Santiago del Solar noted how producers in his home country use huge plastic storage bags to make up for missing silos. &quot;It&apos;s an Argentinean solution&quot;, he said, &quot;cheap and clean&quot;. Reducing waste at the other end of the food cycle is equally important. Unilever&apos;s Jan Kees Vis argued that food should be affordable, not cheap, as &quot;cheap food leads to waste&quot;. Business has a key role to play here. The new UK Hospitality and Food Service Agreement offers a prime example of an industry sector linking with government and non-profits to tackle the problem. Getting consumers to think about food use is the primary concern, however. That requires food retailers to get involved. &quot;I guess our role is also to focus on not promoting bulk purchases where this is unnecessary&quot;, said Woolworth&apos;s Justin Smith. Discounting &quot;normal&quot; sized portions could be one solution. Information on production methods is also helpful, said Louise Fresco, but only if it&apos;s easy to understand. Engaging youth Food security is an issue that today&apos;s young people will become only too aware of. So engage them now in sustainable consumption, the panel agreed. On the consumer side, several participants called for more work in schools. UK supermarket Sainsbury&apos;s was cited for its work promoting gardening in schools. Don&apos;t forget tomorrow&apos;s farmers either. Young people need to be persuaded that farming can provide a viable future. For that to happen, it requires them to have the skills to farm efficiently, as well as the incentive of being paid fairly. Companies can contribute in both cases. Collaborating together If there was one message that rang our throughout the discussion, it was the need for collaboration. &quot;For emerging market businesses, much of the focus needs to be on creating partnership opportunities that bring more small scale farmers&quot;, said Justin Smith. Matching small-scale suppliers with well-resourced primary suppliers is the kind of solution he had in mind. Jan Kees Vis had a word for the big players too: cooperation, not competition, has to be the watchword going forward. It&apos;s time to reaffirm sustainable agriculture as a &quot;pre-competitive issue&quot;, he said. The time is also right to start &quot;re-connecting&quot; in supply chains: e.g. linking end users to primary producers. &quot;I have taken Unilever Board members to tea estates in Africa, to oil palm plantations in Malaysia, to tomato farms in Italy ...

For decades - before there were economic gains to be made from international student recruitment and possibly even before the term was coined - the brightest and wealthiest students from developing countries have gone to study abroad. The institutions selected have been as much a reflection of the political ties between countries, as they&apos;ve been an indication of a student&apos;s personal ambitions. But since the development of the higher education market, the rising costs of a university education and the diminishing support of governments through the public purse, universities - old and new - are actively pursuing internationalisation strategies. The other big change of course, is that the new key players in higher education (India, China and Brazil) reflect wider geopolitical shifts. Still, to see internationalisation as simply synonymous with international student recruitment is both a limited approach and one loaded with concerns over neo-colonialism and imperialism. The sector now speaks more of international partnerships \u2013 from research collaborations and consultancy to academic and student exchanges. Engaging globally has becomes both more popular and more complex. In turn, universities are beginning to adopt a variety of approaches \u2013 often led by institution heads.  In this brave new world, how do you go about developing a strategy that works and is embedded in your existing institutional culture? How do you pick your partners and as universities start multiple partnerships in multiple countries, how do you determine who the stakeholders are, to whom you should be accountable? And, perhaps most contentious of all, how do you assess internationalisation strategies? Should universities measure their activities or the impact of those activities? Ultimately, what does quality look like in international higher education? Join our panel, Friday 17 August to understand the place internationalisation strategies fill within wider higher education and share your experiences and expertise on how the best internationalisation strategies are developed.

Think of Italian sunshine, the cafes of the Netherlands and the cool style of Denmark. The benefits of language and cultural awareness are enormous, and studying abroad could even be a bargain in terms of how much you pay for\u00a0tuition. Studying in Scandinavia is free, with Denmark offering free Danish lessons to every foreign student, while the Netherlands is an increasingly popular choice for its quality of teaching and low tuition fees. And there are options further afield. Sinead Neville, 21, is studying for a BA in Anthropology at the University of Melbourne. Despite getting ABB at A-level, Neville felt the heat of the competition for places at &quot;any decent university&quot;. &quot;I&apos;ve found the teaching at Melbourne to be quite incredible, with personable tutors. Australia is now my home and I&apos;ve learned so much from simply being in Melbourne with its cultural diversity and endless things to do&quot;, she says. So what is the added value of studying abroad? Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters, says: &quot;The ability to speak a second language is a real CV boost. Plus, undergraduates who study abroad are likely to return with an appreciation of diverse societies and political systems, and an ability to stand on their own two feet. Combined with a good academic record from a reputable university, these personal qualities will make graduates highly attractive to employers.&quot; John Wastnage, a policy adviser for the British Chamber of Commerce, says studying or working abroad helps students stand out from the crowd. In particular, they should use the experience to generate new sales or business ideas. &quot;The more people in the workforce who have lived abroad and speak other languages, the better placed UK businesses will be to grow and create prosperity,&quot; he argues. &quot;We need British workers to develop these skills through Erasmus, Leonardo and in emerging markets too.&quot; Many degree programmes in Europe are offered in English, particularly in Holland. Each institution also has its own learning philosophy; the University of Amsterdam, for example, allows you to design your own individual study programme. Elsewhere, Trinity College in Dublin is ranked highly in world league tables and the University of Milan attracts medical students. For a more recognisably British education in a more exotic location, the University of Nottingham has campuses in China and Malaysia. For a part-time option, the Erasmus programme allows undergraduates to do some of their degree abroad. The University of Sheffield has good links across the world and the Study Abroad Programme has opportunities in countries such as Canada, the US, Japan, Korea and Australia. For many, the experience of learning abroad will stay in the memory for ever. Zachi Brewster, 21, is studying at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Piedmont, northern Italy and recommends the experience. &quot;They say it&apos;s a small world, but for me studying abroad has made my world bigger. There&apos;s so much out there waiting to be discovered.

Elsa Maxwell's Tory ball, New York, 1955, by William Klein    The most anticipated London show is surely Tate Modern&apos;s ambitious double header William Klein/Daido Moriyama, which opens on 10 October. Taking the cities of New York and Tokyo as its starting point, the show contrasts the approaches of two pioneers of impressionistic urban photography. It considers the influence of Klein&apos;s seminal 1956 book, Life Is Good and Good for You in New York, on Japanese photography, and Moriyama in particular. The prodigiously productive Moriyama was a founder of the radical Provoke movement in Japan and, alongside previously unseen vintage prints, the exhibition explores photography&apos;s role in the representation of protest movements and civil unrest. This is an ambitious show that will be a chance for many of us to see lots of Moriyama&apos;s images outside of book form for the first time. I, for one, cannot wait.     Yokosuka 1970/2003 by Daido Moriyama    The other big London exhibition is the Barbican&apos;s group show, Everything Was Moving: Photography from the 60s and 70s, which opens on 13 September. This survey show reflects on the radical cultural shifts that took place around the world during the two decades. It shows work by well-known names such as William Eggleston, David Goldblatt, Boris Mikhalov and Bruce Davidson alongside the likes of Graciela Iturbide, Shomei Thomatsu and Raghubir Singh. Iturbide&apos;s work was one of the highlights of last year&apos;s Rencontres d&apos;Arles and Thomatsu is arguably Japan&apos;s most influential postwar photographer, so this show promises to be intriguing, if only for the range of styles on display from a seemingly disparate bunch of innovators.     From the series Mothers of Martyrs by Newsha Tavakolian    In November, the Victoria and Albert Museum hosts Light from the Middle East, the first major show of contemporary photography from the region. This intriguing exhibition brings together 30 artists from 13 different countries, including Abbas, Yousssef Nabil and Shadi Ghadirian. I am most looking forward to Newsha Takavolian&apos;s provocative series Mothers of Martyrs, which may divide opinion, but is undeniably powerful in its evocation of belonging, belief and mourning. Elsewhere, Amsterdam hosts the first international Unseen Photo Fair from 19 to 23 September, which will feature previously unexhibited work by emerging photographers. The aim is to give &quot;new photography the platform in deserves&quot; and, to this end, more than 50 galleries from around the globe will be showing work from their most promising new talents. Four hundred lucky visitors have already been given \u20ac1,000 each to spend on photography courtesy of the Dutch cultural lottery. There will be work for sale by the likes of Alex Prager, Pieter Hugo, Alessandra Sanguinetti and Richard Mosse. A place for the curious as well as the committed collector to look at \u2013 and buy \u2013 photography. Plus, it will be interesting to see just how far the galleries go in interpreting the definition of Unseen. Also in September, as part of Liverpool Biennial, the Open Eye gallery presents two controversial series by the Japanese photographer Kohei Yoshiyuki: The Park and Love Hotel. Both investigate the seedier side of sex \u2013 and both precipitated furious debates in Japan about the blurred line between reportage and voyeurism. The Park, already a cult photobook, is the end result of Yoshiyuki&apos;s participation in the nocturnal goings-on in Shinjuku&apos;s Chuo Park in the early 1970s, when he photographed voyeurs who lurked in the bushes to spy on couples having furtive sex on the grass. The images in Love Hotel were taken in 1978 from sex tapes made by clients of one of Tokyo&apos;s infamous book-by-the-hour hotels. Both series are grainy and indistinct, but undeniably evocative. And provocative. In London on 12 October, the Photographers&apos; Gallery presents a long-overdue retrospective of the Irish-born photographer Tom Wood, who has been working for the last 25 years in and around Merseyside and Liverpool. He also shot the unforgettable Looking for Love series in a &quot;disco-pub&quot; in Chelsea Reach in London in the 1980s. His book Photie Man \u2013 the name given to him by the kids he photographed on Merseyside \u2013 is the best introduction to his work, which skirts street photography, portraiture and reportage, but cannot really be classed as any of them. Great to see the work of a singular photographer who doesn&apos;t fit in neatly to any tradition being celebrated by the Photographers&apos; Gallery.     Naval Base, Galley (Canteen) from Edmund Clark's Guant\u00e1namo: If the Light Goes Out    The fifth edition of the Brighton Biennial takes place from 6 October to 4 November in venues across the city. It&apos;s titled Agents of Change: Photography and the Politics of Space, and will feature artists including Omer Fast, Julian Germain, Trevor Paglen, Jason Larkin, Corinne Silva and Edmund Clark, whose project, Guant\u00e1namo: If the Light Goes Out, is shortlisted for this year&apos;s Prix Pictet Prize. The winner is announced at London&apos;s Saatchi Gallery on October 9, and a show of the shortlisted artists runs there from 10-28 October. Finally, and staying in London, the Taylor Wessing Photographic Prize Exhibition is at the National Portrait Gallery from 8 November to 17 February 2013. As one of this year&apos;s judges, I can&apos;t say much more about it at present, but will be commenting on it from the inside when the shortlist is announced in September. Watch this space. Now see this From 18 August, Third Floor Gallery in Cardiff is showing Encuentro by Irish photographer Maurice Gunning. It focuses on the Argentine-Irish community in Buenos Aries, descendants of the original immigrants that arrived there in the 1800s. Gunning&apos;s poetic, fragmentary style is perfectly suited to the kind of visual storytelling that draws on memory, text and longing to at once evoke the past and the present. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2012.

The 24-year-old, who has entered the final year of his contract with Heerenveen, had been expected to join Ajax but rejected a move to Amsterdam over personal terms. Martin Jol then sought to use his Dutch contacts to bring Assaidi to Craven Cottage only for Liverpool to agree a deal that will see the winger become Brendan Rodgers&apos;s third summer signing. He is due on Merseyside on Thursday night and should he pass a medical and be registered before noon on Friday, he can go straight into the squad for the Premier League opener at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Rodgers does not view Assaidi as an immediate first-team starter but someone who will improve his options on both flanks and strengthen the Liverpool squad. The winger has spent his entire professional career in the Dutch leagues and had the choice of playing at international level with Holland or Morocco. He chose the latter, making 22 appearances for his country so far, and was also wanted by Spartak Moscow and Galatasaray before Liverpool made their approach. Rodgers is also pursuing loan deals for Nuri Sahin of Real Madrid and Barcelona&apos;s Cristian Tello and said on Thursday that he hopes &quot;to get one or two in within the next 48 hours&quot;. The Liverpool manager has told Steven Gerrard that he envisages the club captain continuing as an attacking midfielder this season, and the 32-year-old agrees there is no reason to change his game yet. Gerrard has been hampered by serious injury for the past two seasons but having enjoyed a fine European Championship as England captain, he believes it is premature to drop into a deeper role at Liverpool. Gerrard said: &quot;He&apos;s spoken to me about what role he sees me filling. I still think he sees me as an attacking midfielder but as we work through the ages, maybe 33 or 34, then maybe I might be dropping a bit deeper. &quot;But I don&apos;t think anything is going to change in my game this season. I still think I can play a dynamic energy-type game. I&apos;m prepared to adapt, I&apos;ll do whatever the manager wants, but I can still play the same way. &quot;I&apos;m 32. I had major surgery on my groin and I had a big operation on my ankle through bad luck, but they&apos;re gone. My groin injuries now are better than they&apos;ve been from 21-30, so that&apos;s the only difference I can see. My figures in the Euros were as good as any player there, so I don&apos;t need to sit in front of anyone and say I have to play a different role, I&apos;m thinking of a Paul Scholes role. &quot;Paul Scholes is four years older than me. I think people want me to say I can&apos;t play the same way any more, that I have to go deeper to control the game from deep and play a slower game but believe me, it&apos;s not happening, not yet. I&apos;ll play the Scholes role when I feel it&apos;s time, but it&apos;s not time yet. I can play that role no problem, I played it when I was 21, so I can do it when I&apos;m 32-33-34.&quot; The Liverpool captain admits this campaign represents another period of transition for the club, with Rodgers his fourth manager in four seasons. Gerrard added: &quot;I think when a new manager comes in it&apos;s always a rebuilding process in certain respects. I&apos;m always honest, I&apos;m always realistic. It&apos;s impossible to say it&apos;s the title this year, people will laugh at me.&quot;", "sentences": ["The 24-year-old, who has entered the final year of his contract with Heerenveen, had been expected to join Ajax but rejected a move to Amsterdam over personal terms."], "title": "Liverpool see off Ajax and Fulham to sign Oussama Assaidi for \u00a32.4m", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/16/liverpool-oussama-assaidi", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Heerenveen", "Transfer window", "European club football", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-17T21:45:05Z", "article": "Herman Koch&apos;s The Dinner is, like Christos Tsiolkas&apos;s The Slap, a novel whose premise can be neatly reduced. Two couples meet in a fancy restaurant\u00a0in Amsterdam to discuss an outrage perpetrated by their sons. As the evening progresses, civilised behaviour breaks down, revealing that\u00a0the parents are not so different from their children. Roman Polanski&apos;s 2011 film Carnage covers similar territory; the urbane, liberal sheen is quickly rubbed off two sets of New York parents when they meet to discuss a fight between their sons. In The Dinner, although the boys may be products of their parents, they come from two very different families, and the grotesqueness revealed in the novel is of a different order. The boys&apos; fathers, Paul and Serge Lohman, are brothers. The narrator, Paul, is a teacher &quot;placed on non-active&quot;, while Serge is a charismatic politician in the running for Holland&apos;s premiership. The book is divided into\u00a0courses, and during the aperitif and appetiser it&apos;s hard not to side with Paul&apos;s assessment that his richer, better looking, more popular brother is overly smooth, insincere and sexist. Many readers will be inclined to meet Paul halfway on this; after all, even when we&apos;re voting for them, who really\u00a0trusts a politician? Paul&apos;s voice is initially beguiling. He describes Serge&apos;s rural retreat in France as having &quot;a whiff of Boursin \u2026 imitation cheese that had nothing to do with French cheese&quot;. But as the novel progresses on to the main course, it becomes increasingly clear that Paul&apos;s jibes may not simply be attempts to puncture his brother&apos;s hypocrisy. What qualifies him to label Serge a hypocrite? For instance, there is nothing except Paul&apos;s insistence that Serge and his wife do not really love their adopted son Beau as much as they love their biological children. The differences between the brothers might suggest that nature and\u00a0nurture are equally irrelevant, but\u00a0family bonds are important to Paul. His\u00a0 intense love for his only son Michel is matched by the devotion he feels for his wife Claire. Three-legged structures are the strongest, and together the trio are solid. When Michel and his cousin commit their terrible act, Paul and Claire are forced to decide where their loyalties lie. Are they confined to their small family unit or do they extend to the human family, society? Will the couple sacrifice one for the good of the other? Paul recognises the liberal values professed by his country and his politician brother. He understands the\u00a0unfairness of sexism and racism and has no problem with homosexuality. Paul is also empathetic, up to a point. He remembers how the face of a schoolchild to whom he said something unrepeatable &quot;broke down the middle. Like a vase. Or like a glass that shatters at a high pitched note&quot;, but it gradually becomes clear that Paul&apos;s keen sense of observation and tendency to analyse others are symptoms of his own dislocation. For Paul is a violent man who needs medication to control his impulses. Koch paces his revelations expertly, and there are twists and turns enough to keep us reading, but his decision to ascribe the former teacher&apos;s violent outbreaks to a biological defect \u2013 to make Paul&apos;s condition something other than simply the human condition \u2013 diminishes the book. Paul is clearly not &quot;one of us&quot;, whoever &quot;we&quot; may be. But The Dinner is more than its plot, and Paul&apos;s voice, combined with his knowledge of his own flawed personality, has the potential to sustain the novel without the drama of the two boys&apos; transgressions and their parents&apos; divided responses. Near the beginning of the novel, Paul quotes the opening sentence of Anna Karenina: &quot;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&quot; By the end\u00a0of the novel, he has disproved the theory. His own happy family is unique, but happiness isn&apos;t everything. \u2022 Louise Welsh&apos;s The Girl on the Stairs is published by John Murray.

But he was right. This author had the nice idea to &quot;visit the internet&quot;, or examine the tubes, so off he trots to see exchanges crammed with routers in London and Amsterdam, data centres in Oregon, and a Portuguese beach where new undersea cable to Africa is being laid. Cheerful engineers show him round &quot;cyberrific&quot; facilities filled with &quot;blinky lights&quot;, and he demonstrates well that the internet tracks established lines of political geography, and that the &quot;cloud&quot; is physical and secretive.The ratio here of traveloguey musing to technical elucidation, however, is cirrostratusly high. I ended up little the wiser about how fibre-optic cable works, while Blum devotes excruciating amounts of local colour to each trip: confirmation emails, hire cars, stop-offs at tourist attractions. Still, he is heroic, in a way, in expending so many words describing near-identical buildings. &quot;I had learned what the internet looked like, generally speaking: a self-storage warehouse.&quot;Stars: A Very Short Introduction by Andrew King (Oxford, \u00a37.99)Technical elucidation, this book shows, can in the right hands be a lot more exciting than What I Did on My Research Trip. The astrophysicist author delights in his continuing scientific detective story, from the discovery that the sun is a ball of hot gas to the realisation that every atom in our own bodies must have come from inside a star. Some of the physics is pleasantly counterintuitive (&quot;Stars heat up when they try to cool&quot;), and the reader also learns about x-rays, quantum tunnelling and stellar recycling (which doesn&apos;t mean doing the right thing with your empty beer cans).It&apos;s hard not to anthropomorphise stars, if not quite as the ancient Greeks did: they &quot;evolve&quot; and strain mightily to avoid &quot;degeneracy&quot; throughout their &quot;lives&quot;. Cleverly, King takes us through the biographies of various sorts of star, revealing only at the end\u00a0that we have just witnessed the creation of a white dwarf or black hole.\u00a0&quot;So\u00a0that&apos;s what a supernova is,&quot; I\u00a0realised with satisfaction, even though I still didn&apos;t know much about fibre-optics.Wait: The Useful Art of Procrastination by Frank Partnoy (Profile, \u00a312.99)&quot;Excellent,&quot; I thought when I picked this off the pile and scanned the blurb, &quot;a book about the virtues of procrastination. Must be time for lunch.&quot; When,\u00a0days later, I got round to reading it at the last possible minute, I realised I was supposed to take even more time to evaluate it, since its message is that\u00a0we tend to &quot;react too quickly&quot; in\u00a0making decisions. Waiting a\u00a0bit, writes the amiable law-and-finance-prof author, is usually a good idea: he discusses useful delays in the expert actions of fighter pilots, sportspeople and doctors; how comedians place a &quot;beat&quot;; why a &quot;snap apology&quot; can be a bad idea; and how a high-frequency stock-trading system (exploiting the mysteries of fibre-optic cable) got better results when forced to\u00a0slow down.Putting things off, then, can be &quot;smart&quot;, despite the exhausting rhetoric of what Partnoy calls &quot;the do-it-now anti-procrastination industry&quot;. It&apos;s a\u00a0smoothly sceptical essay: partly contra-Gladwellian, but with the\u00a0same comfy furniture of sports anecdotes and chirpy scientists. I instinctively approved of the basic message \u2013 &quot;Think\u00a0more!&quot; \u2013 but I had run out of time to decide reliably whether it was a\u00a0good idea.", "sentences": ["This author had the nice idea to &quot;visit the internet&quot;, or examine the tubes, so off he trots to see exchanges crammed with routers in London and Amsterdam, data centres in Oregon, and a Portuguese beach where new undersea cable to Africa is being laid."], "title": "Et cetera: Steven Poole's non-fiction choice - review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/17/et-cetera-poole-non-fiction-review", "tags": ["Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-17T22:01:00Z", "article": "Welcome to the \u00a39,000 tuition fee refugees. The number of British students applying to Dublin&apos;s Trinity College has jumped by 20% to nearly 2,000 this year. At University College Dublin (UCD), applications from students with British A-levels have surged 37% from 800 to around 1,100. The University of Groningen in the Netherlands, where many courses are taught entirely in English, has seen the number of applicants from Britain quadruple in the last two years alone. British 18-year-olds are fleeing the prospect of a \u00a350,000 bill for studying at home \u2013 and finding they can save as much as \u00a325,000 over three years by studying abroad as well as enjoying a life-changing experience. In Denmark, tuition fees for students from within the EU are zero. In the Netherlands, they are around \u20ac1,700 a year (\u00a31,330), and it&apos;s even possible to access Dutch state grants worth around \u20ac500 (\u00a3390) a month (see page 5). Irish institutions such as Trinity and UCD, ranked among the top universities in Europe, charge just \u20ac2,250 a year (\u00a31,760) to EU citizens. It has also emerged that a significant number of UK students have applied to universities in the EU as an &quot;insurance&quot; against failing to achieve the grades they want and having to go through clearing. Many British &quot;Russell group&quot; universities now demand A-level scores of AAB and above, while similarly-ranked Dutch universities accept lower grades \u2013 though they are much tougher (almost brutal, say some) about weeding out underperforming students in their first term. &quot;It&apos;s not exactly a flood of students fleeing the new tuition fees in Britain, but we are seeing much more interest,&quot; says Mark Huntington, who runs astarfuture.co.uk, which has since 2006 offered a free advisory service to British students and parents considering higher education opportunities abroad. There are now more than 1,200 degree courses in Europe (not including Ireland) taught entirely in English, while in the Netherlands alone 20 universities are teaching in English. &quot;The overall cost of a three-year course in Holland, taking in tuition fees, accommodation and living costs, will be around \u00a324,000 compared with the \u00a350,000 or so it now costs in the UK,&quot; says Huntington. But, as he warns on his website, &quot;we don&apos;t believe you should go abroad just to save money and there are lots of other reasons why studying abroad is a good idea. &quot;It is also worth bearing in mind that even though a degree abroad may be significantly cheaper than an equivalent qualification in the UK, you will possibly have to pay out more up front than if you were to study at home.&quot; Not being able to speak a word of Dutch, Danish or Flemish does not seem to be a problem. &quot;You could survive the whole way through a course in Holland without learning a word of Dutch,&quot; says Huntington. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t recommend it, but it is possible.&quot; Hania Thurlow, 18, from Norwich, left for Maastricht University yesterday a day after learning she had got A*AB in her A-levels. She initially planned to go to the University of Exeter, anticipating three A grades, but was deterred by the costs. &quot;The fees really put me off,&quot; she said. &quot;I know you can take out loans and don&apos;t have to repay them straight away, but it&apos;s still a huge debt. Accommodation costs are lower too. In Maastricht I will pay \u20ac375 (\u00a3293) rent a month for a room, but Exeter wanted \u00a3125 a week (\u00a3540/month). Even travel is cheaper \u2013 I can fly home from Eindhoven for around \u00a330 on Ryanair, less than the cost of going to Manchester.&quot; She is aware of the tougher first year students face in the Netherlands compared to Britain, but is unfazed: &quot;The first year is supposed to be quite difficult. But I&apos;m going to university to study hard anyway.&quot; She has also already lined up part-time employment (arranged through the university) as a babysitter for Dutch families, and will be starting lessons in Dutch when she arrives. She says one other student from her school in Norwich is already at Maastricht, and another has applied. Christian Garrard from Canterbury, who is about to start his fourth year studying law at the University of Groningen says: &quot;It&apos;s the best decision I have ever made. I had a Dutch girlfriend and if it wasn&apos;t for her I would probably have thought, no way. It was only really daunting until I got here. As an international student you live in an international house, mostly with other foreign students who all speak English, while Groningen is almost becoming a bilingual university. I&apos;ve thrived on it, though maybe if you&apos;re more of a home-bird it&apos;s not for you.&quot; Garrard worked part-time, which also enabled him to access Dutch grants, meaning that after two years he had no debts at all: &quot;I was even saving money at one point.&quot; But it is the Republic of Ireland which is seeing the biggest surge in British students beating the tuition fee hikes. For many 18-year-olds it is far less daunting than going to a non-English speaking country and many arrive with family connections in the country. The major barrier is academic entry requirements. &quot;The grade requirements can be almost ridiculously high,&quot; warns Huntington. The Irish equivalent of A-levels is the Leaving Cert, which covers six subjects. Unless a British student has studied four A-levels and gained good grades, they may find it difficult to obtain enough points to qualify for an Irish university. Prices in Dublin, once one of Europe&apos;s most expensive cities, is another issue, though the cost of living has fallen in recent years. UCD says rent for on-campus rooms are \u20ac486 a month (\u00a3380), while living off campus nearby in Rathmines would be about \u20ac450 (\u00a3352). The universities of Cork, Limerick and Galway all charge similar tuition fees but with lower living costs. Most of the &quot;bargain&quot; tuition fees are in EU countries, but some students are heading further afield. The University of Nottingham has set up campuses in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Ningbo, China (south of Shanghai), where students graduate with a UK degree. At \u00a37,100, fees at the Kuala Lumpur campus are not far short of the cost of studying at Nottingham, and most students are from Malaysia, but a number are now coming from Britain, many having gained scholarships. Without scholarships (and no access to student grants) the financial equation is much less attractive, though living costs are a fraction of the UK. In Ningbo, student accommodation is \u00a3100 a year. Nottingham was first to pioneer campuses abroad, and others are following: Reading University is opening a Malaysian campus in 2015 while Liverpool is partnering with a university in Shanghai. Emerging universities in Asia, keen to recruit European students, are also offering highly attractive scholarship programmes to students with decent A-level grades. Ben Poulter, 18, from Brentwood County High, a state school in Essex, will be packing his bags in a few weeks&apos; time to head to Singapore, where he will begin a four-year course in business at SP Jain Global School of Management. His second year will be in Dubai, followed by two years in Sydney, Australia. And the $18,000 annual tuition fees will be sliced to zero as it&apos;s entirely paid for by the scholarship. &quot;SP Jain came to our school and gave a presentation to year 12 and year 13 [lower and upper sixth],&quot; he says. &quot;I applied and they offered me a scholarship almost immediately after the interview so long as I got AAB at A-level. I&apos;m really excited. It&apos;s a little bit daunting, but an incredible opportunity.&quot; Poulter was lucky; his school encouraged students to consider opportunities abroad. But Gerard Spencer, founder of europeducation.org.uk, which provides information on studying in Europe for students and parents, says: &quot;Unfortunately, most British schools don&apos;t talk about options outside the UK for higher education. Admissions to European universities for September 2012 are now closed. But postponing the decision for a year and starting in a European university in 2013 would be a unique and life-changing decision.&quot; Reality restricts the overseas options British students have a huge range of options for studying abroad, but the reality \u2013 if you want to keep costs low and can only speak English \u2013 is that Ireland and the Netherlands are head and shoulders above the rest. We&apos;ve highlighted a few other choices \u2013 Denmark and Norway in particular, as they do not charge tuition fees. We excluded France and Germany because they have few courses taught in English (apart from a few specialist private universities). The US and Australia, with pricey tuition fees, only come into the picture because they offer numerous scholarships. Republic of Ireland     Republic of Ireland flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee \u20ac2,250 (\u00a31,760) student contribution for 2012/2013, expected to rise to \u20ac2,500 (\u00a31,955) next year. Students also pay &quot;capitation&quot; fees at institutions such as University College Dublin (\u20ac183/\u00a3143) to cover facilities such as its 50m pool. Private universities charge around \u20ac5,000 (\u00a33,900) a year. What&apos;s available Seven universities, 14 institutes of technology and a number of private universities. Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin are ranked in the world&apos;s top 200 universities. Entry requirements Tough. Based on points score in the Irish Leaving Certificate (six subjects, maximum 600 points for six As). A British A grade is worth 135 points, so students will need four good A-levels to obtain a place a leading university. Irish universities do not make conditional offers. No one receives an offer from an Irish university until they have received their grades. Grants/Scholarships No Irish state grants for UK students. Individual universities have limited scholarships/exhibitions for top students. Accommodation Not cheap. As an example, University College Dublin this year charges \u20ac486 (\u00a3380) per month. Living costs High, especially in Dublin, where the price level is similar to London or higher. Part-time earning opportunities more limited than in the past; the Irish unemployment rate is 14.8% compared with 8.1% in the UK. Netherlands     Netherlands flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee \u20ac1,771 (\u00a31,385) for most courses. Expected to rise in line with inflation. What&apos;s available Twenty universities offer degrees taught entirely in English, although at some (such as Amsterdam) there may be just one or two courses in English. Groningen and Maastricht are the most popular among British applicants. Groningen, founded in 1614 and one of the Netherlands&apos; oldest universities, currently offers nine undergraduate programmes in English but will raise that to 19 in 2013. Entry requirements A general rule is that a GCSE in three subjects with marks ranging from A*-C, plus a GCE (A-level) with three subjects at advanced level (six different subjects in total) is comparable to a Dutch VWO diploma and thus admissible for a programme in a Dutch university. Grants/Scholarships British students can access Dutch student finance on exactly the same basis as local students. So long as you find part-time work of at least 32 hours a month and pay Dutch national insurance, you qualify for a grant of \u20ac266 (\u00a3208) a month, plus you can apply for a means-tested additional grant of up to \u20ac242 (\u00a3189) a month. Students can also borrow up to \u20ac285 (\u00a3223) a month if they have been awarded the full means-tested grant. Accommodation Expensive in Amsterdam. Don&apos;t expect en-suite bathrooms. Rents outside the capital are typically \u20ac200-\u20ac400 (\u00a3150-\u00a3300) a month. Living costs Approximately the same as London and the south-east of England, but higher than the north of England. Expect to pay around \u00a33.70 for a pint in city centre Dutch bars. Denmark     Denmark flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee Denmark does not charge tuition fees to anyone with an EU passport. So nothing to pay over three years. What&apos;s available There are 27 universities and higher education colleges in Denmark, but only a few offer courses taught in English. About the best option is the University of Southern Denmark, based in Odense, about an hour-and-a-half south of Copenhagen. Entry requirements If you have A-levels you should be eligible for entry to a Danish university. Details at StudyinDenmark.dk Grants/Scholarships Limited. No state grants or loans for UK students. Accommodation USD says expect to pay around \u00a3235 a month for rent, but much more in Copenhagen. Living costs Very high. Denmark is not in the euro and its krone has risen in value in recent years. But students with EU nationality are able to work, and pay rates are relatively high. Norway     Norway flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee Norway&apos;s state universities do not charge students from any country. What&apos;s available There are seven universities and eight specialist universities, but few offer courses taught in English. But the University of Nordland, inside the Arctic Circle, welcomed 200 international students last year and has courses taught in English in subjects such as marine ecology. Entry requirements The minimum requirement is five GCE passes, of which two must be A-levels. Grants/Scholarships Limited. Accommodation Student rent at the University of Nordland is \u00a3375 a month Living costs Some of the highest in the world, with the Norwegian krone one of the world&apos;s strongest currencies. A bottle of beer in a pub can cost anything up to \u00a37, while a loaf of bread is around \u00a32.70. United States     US flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee Vary enormously. Most universities quote all-in tuition, lodging and food prices at around $20,000 - $45,000 a year (\u00a312,700-\u00a328,600), so they&apos;re not cheap. What&apos;s available Immense. There are around 4,000 universities in the US. Entry requirements Visas are required, and you must depart after completing the course. International students must have a certificate of completion which allows admission to a university in their home country. Grants/Scholarships Extensive scholarship programmes in academic subjects and sports. The scholarship will typically be worth around 50% of the cost of studying in the US. InTuitionScholarships (student-scholarships.com) says it helps around 50-60 Brits a year obtain academic scholarships to the US. Accommodation With a scholarship, you should be paying around \u00a36,500-\u00a39,000 a year for the total package of accommodation, tuition and food. Living costs Vary enormously. Accommodation outside the centre of major cities is cheap, but food is about the same price as the UK. Australia      Australia flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee Fees are usually in the range of AU$15,000-20,000 (\u00a310,000 - \u00a313,000) for undergraduate degrees, so higher than the UK. Huge amounts of information at studyinaustralia.gov.au.  What&apos;s available Vast array at some of the world&apos;s best universities; 21 of the country&apos;s universities are ranked in the world&apos;s top 400. Entry requirements Similar to UK. Terms start in February. Students must obtain visas to study in Australia. Grants/Scholarships Australia has a wide array of scholarships on offer. Accommodation Expect to pay up to \u00a3700 a month for sharing in sought-after locations.

But by the end of the year, if meticulous planning pays off, the Black Fish could be making headlines with the launch of a guerrilla-style campaign against illegal fishing in European waters. Taking their name from the term given to illegally caught fish, the Amsterdam-based group has a budget of only a few thousand pounds a year and pays no salaries, but boasts contacts and activists from across Europe, including Britain. Within weeks it expects to have raised around \u00a3500,000 from wealthy European backers to buy its first boat, a former coastguard vessel. The aim will be high-profile confrontation on the high seas. Greenpeace&apos;s first action was to sail to the Aleutian islands to stop the dropping of an atomic bomb. The Black Fish crew of 12 will sail to the Mediterranean, where they plan to stay for three years to confront illegal fishermen, and, they hope, embarrass commercial companies and persuade Europe to ban completely the catching of endangered fish, such as the bluefin tuna that they have released off Croatia. Each year 30-40,000 tonnes of Atlantic bluefin tuna are legally caught in the Mediterranean and towed to farms in Croatia and elsewhere in giant nets. The fish are then fattened for several months until they reach the target size of around 250kg, when they are sold, largely to Japan, where a single 269kg fish was sold this year for a record price of nearly half a million pounds. Most Mediterranean tuna farms act responsibly, but spiralling prices encourage trawlers to far exceed quota limits and catch many juveniles. The result, says conservation group WWF, is that up to 20,000 tonnes of tuna are illegally caught each year. Breeding numbers have plummeted in the last five years, suggesting that the whole fishery could collapse within a few years, perhaps never to recover. The tuna trade will be the Black Fish&apos;s primary target. &quot;We have identified the boat \u2013 we are on the point of buying it \u2013 the crew has put their lives on hold and we are ready to go,&quot; says Wietse van der Werf, a Dutch environmental activist who spent six years in Nottingham working with Earth First! and was co-founder of the community media group Notts Indymedia. The group sees itself as a young, fleet-footed organisation with most of its founders and members in their 20s and none of the disadvantages and burdens of bureaucratic, membership-based organisations. Last month the group released thousands of endangered bluefin tuna, worth millions of pounds on the Japanese market, after activists located a series of Croatian fish farms where tuna were being fattened up. As guard boats circled and under the eyes of men in a watchtower, members of the group cut a large hole in one of the nets and watched a silver tide of the most expensive fish in the world escape into the Adriatic. According to the group, thousands of tuna of all ages and sizes escaped. In another successful action, a small group of Black Fish divers went to Japan and cut the nets of six pens in Taiji that were holding dolphins destined for international theme parks. The group has also won a battle to close down a German dolphinarium. Van der Werf, a vegan who says he encountered police spy Mark Kennedy when he infiltrated their group in Nottingham, has travelled twice to the Antarctic with Paul Watson&apos;s Sea Shepherd conservation group to stop Japanese whaling. In 2010 he helped Watson release 800 bluefin tuna off the Libyan coast, an action that led to a court case that was dismissed earlier this year. &quot;I came off the Sea Shepherd boat with nothing. I borrowed \u20ac500 to set up the group and I had \u20ac50 left. We have raised money from benefit concerts, and supporters. No one has been paid but we can call on web designers, legal firms and fishery experts,&quot; said Van der Werf, who originally trained as a violin-maker. &quot;We realised that you don&apos;t need to be a huge Greenpeace or Sea Shepherd with millions of pounds and big staff behind you to act; you can start small, be flexible. We want to move away from the &apos;hero&apos; complex and encourage ordinary people to act for the oceans,&quot; he said. &quot;Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd inspired us, but what is not needed now is an organisation similar to them. We need more of a social movement of people who work on marine protection. Conservation groups talk the language of politicians and MPs. There is an increasing gap between them and the public. I have trouble understanding their reports. We want to inspire other local initiatives.&quot; The Black Fish has positioned itself firmly at the &quot;no compromise&quot; end of the green spectrum. &quot;We don&apos;t see ourselves as witnesses, more as enforcers of law. We want evidence of illegality and we are prepared to take direct action. We don&apos;t want to just build awareness, but achieve change. We want to be judged by our actions and be effective,&quot; said Van der Werf. &quot;We have growing support from the public. We have customs officers, tube drivers, all kinds of people.&quot; He claims the tacit support of most European conservation groups, but the group is certain to cross swords with those who advocate reform of fishing practices rather than an absolute reduction in the catch. The high-profile campaign by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Jamie Oliver to ban &quot;discards&quot; \u2013 young fish that are not allowed to be sold in EU markets and are thrown away \u2013 is not good enough, he says. &quot;In effect they are saying it&apos;s a waste of fish; let&apos;s eat the by-catch,&quot; said Van der Werf. &quot;Sustainable fishing&quot;, promoted by supermarkets and some conservation groups, is totally unsustainable, he says. &quot;It&apos;s a feelgood option. Sustainable fishing has not worked in terms of over-fishing. It just legitimises destructive fishing.&quot; The group has challenged the establishment to change. &quot;Governments and some mainstream conservation groups argue that &apos;aquaculture&apos;, where fish are bred and reared in captivity, is the way forward, with the industry just needing to &apos;clean up&apos;. But can such an industry clean up? Governments have failed by letting this lucrative industry spiral out of control,&quot; says the group on its website. Van de Werf adds: &quot;The fact is 85% of all stocks are overfished. Oceans are rife with corruption. Unless something is done, there will be no fish left.&quot;", "sentences": ["Taking their name from the term given to illegally caught fish, the Amsterdam-based group has a budget of only a few thousand pounds a year and pays no salaries, but boasts contacts and activists from across Europe, including Britain."], "title": "Black Fish activists vow to confront illegal tuna fishing in Mediterranean", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/18/black-fish-tuna-activists", "tags": ["Fishing", "Food", "Marine life", "Environment", "World news", "Endangered species", "Wildlife", "Animals", "Environmental activism", "Protest"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-18T23:05:15Z", "article": "Towards the end of his third year at Sussex, Ian McEwan, somewhat reluctantly, visited the university&apos;s careers office. He already knew that he wanted to be a writer, but perhaps, he thought, this could be done in combination with a parent-placating job: &quot;I had read Seven Pillars of Wisdom [by TE Lawrence] and the one thing I could imagine being was an Arabist diplomat, the kind of man who would wear a dinner jacket one evening and a keffiyeh the next.&quot; The careers office gave him a pamphlet. &quot;On the back of it was a table. There were two columns. On one side was your age, all the way up to 65. On the other was your expected salary at any given age. I looked at it and it filled me with horror. My whole life was there. I was going to spend the next 35 years working my way through this table.&quot; The aspiring author&apos;s riding-a-camel-over-a-sand-dune fantasies were thus brought to a sudden and rather feeble end. Luckily, this was the early 70s, when it was very bliss to be alive. Honestly! &quot;I had the time of my life,&quot; says McEwan, with a fervent smile. &quot;It was very easy not to have a job, to live the life of a full-time writer. I had a huge apartment in south London and it cost me \u00a33 a week. The occasional review for the TLS, the occasional piece for Radio\u00a0Times, and I could very easily pay my rent, buy a few books, make a weekly trip to the launderette. There were no machines everyone needed, apart from a hi-fi. I didn&apos;t feel poor at all. At the risk of sounding like Virginia Woolf, I could live on \u00a3700 a year.&quot; But what about the chaos? The piles of rubbish, the power cuts, the bodies left unburied? &quot;Oh, the crises didn&apos;t trouble me at all. I didn&apos;t own anything; I had no stake. I was restless, excited and a touch reckless. I remember reading Daniel Defoe&apos;s A Journal of the Plague Year. I loved the idea of a city in chaos. There was this line in it that went something like, &apos;We walked north out of London in order not to have the sun on our faces.&apos; I thought: that&apos;s real freedom. I had this &apos;let it come down&apos; feeling.&quot; There follows a brief pause while he considers what brought an end to this low-level insurrection, and I attempt to match up the 70s McEwan, hair trailing his cheesecloth collar, with the 21st-century version, who is today wearing tastefully crushed pale linen. His task is probably the easier. As he will tell me: &quot;The moment you have children and a mortgage you want things to work; you&apos;re locked into the human project and you want it to flourish.&quot; For my part, a leap of imagination is required. When I was told my meeting with McEwan would take place in the boardroom of his publisher, Random House, I was terribly disappointed; I wanted to nose round one of his famously lovely homes (preferably the exquisite Fitzrovia terraced house that was the model for the surgeon Henry Perowne&apos;s house in Saturday). But now it strikes me as rather appropriate. McEwan is the nearest thing to EL James that literary fiction has right now; in this sense, the boardroom chair on which he is uncomfortably perched \u2013 it keeps flipping back, forcing his knees up in the direction of his ears \u2013 might as well be a throne. No wonder I can no more see him in a launderette than I can picture him watching The Only Way is Essex. Anyway, the 70s. That is the decade in which McEwan&apos;s new book, Sweet Tooth, is set. I can&apos;t say too much about its plot, for the simple reason that it&apos;s a novel with a Roger Ackroyd-ish twist and it would be awful to ruin the surprise. But here are the bare bones: Serena Frome is a young Cambridge graduate who finds herself recruited to MI5. An avid reader, she&apos;s deployed to work on a cold war propaganda scheme, codenamed Sweet Tooth, in which government cash will secretly be deployed to fund artists likely to portray the west in a favourable light. One of these artists is a promising young writer, Tom Haley. First, Serena falls in love with his stories. Then she falls in love with their writer. No, she is not a particularly good spy. Her real-life contemporary, Stella Rimington, would have had her for breakfast. (Sweet Tooth, incidentally, makes reference to an ambitious colleague of Serena&apos;s called Millie Trimingham.) How did this curious, beguiling book \u2013 a spy novel without even so much as a hint of a poison-tipped umbrella \u2013 begin? Which came first, MI5 or the 70s? &quot;It&apos;s hard to say,&quot; says McEwan. &quot;I rather drift into my novels. For a long time I&apos;ve been interested in the Encounter affair [Stephen Spender resigned as the editor of the literary magazine Encounter in 1967, after it was revealed that the CIA had been covertly funding it], and I wondered if there was something in there for me; after I finished On Chesil Beach, which is set in the early 60s, I thought: sooner or later I&apos;m going to write about England in the 70s. So I think it was both. In the end, though, I just took up my green notebook and got Serena to start talking \u2013 albeit somewhat against my will.&quot; Why? &quot;Because I&apos;ve got a prejudice against first-person narratives. There are too many of them. They&apos;re too easy; it&apos;s just ventriloquism and authors can hide their terrible style behind characterisation. Any number of cliches are permitted.&quot; McEwan&apos;s MI5 is a hidebound place, staffed mostly by Pooterish, middle-aged men; filing cabinets are the order of the day, not invisible ink. He was, he says, interested in the idea of institutions and how they grow to have their own weird logic. &quot;What was extraordinary about the cultural cold war was that the CIA in particular poured millions of dollars into very worthy things \u2013 like a festival of atonal music in Paris in 1950. The idea was to persuade left-of-centre European intellectuals that the west was best and that America wasn&apos;t just mindless and materialist. And when you think about the horrors the Soviet regime produced, you think: why not? But you also think: why did they do this in secret? Why didn&apos;t the government just use the National Endowment for the Arts or something? It never occurred to them that secrecy wasn&apos;t necessary.&quot; In the novel, though, his interest in MI5 wavers a little once Tom Haley appears on the scene, perhaps because he and Tom Haley have so much in common. Haley teaches at Sussex University; he&apos;s published by Tom Maschler, who first edited McEwan; he does a reading for his first novel with McEwan&apos;s friend, Martin Amis; and two of his stories have been purloined on his behalf from his creator&apos;s backlist. &quot;Yes,&quot; says McEwan. &quot;Well spotted. The novel is a muted and distorted autobiography, though unfortunately a beautiful woman never came into my room and offered me a stipend.&quot; So what is he saying, exactly? This merging of fact and fiction, and the several duplicities that run through the book, when combined with its passionate accounts of reading and writing, suggest, at least to me, that Sweet Tooth is a meditation on the fact that novelists are cunning and cold-hearted thieves; in fact, doesn&apos;t Tom Haley say as much? &quot;Yes. Tom mentions the ruthlessness that is necessary to the process \u2013 and it&apos;s Serena&apos;s fear, too, that he&apos;ll write about her.&quot; Graham Greene said that all writers have a &quot;chip of ice&quot; in their hearts. Does he? &quot;No, I don&apos;t think I do. Philip Roth once said to me years ago, when he took an interest in me as a young writer: you&apos;ve got to write as if your parents are dead. It was very good advice, and I stuck to it, and now I look back with some horror. My father, especially, was torn between exultant pride that I&apos;d published a book and sheer horror at what was in it. So I must have had a steely bit of detachment then. But I&apos;ve never done what Bellow did in Herzog, or Roth, or Hanif [Kureishi]\u2026 put their ex-wives in books. I couldn&apos;t do that.&quot; He thinks for a moment. &quot;My chip of ice is a bit\u2026 slushy.&quot; Ian McEwan is the child of a soldier: his father, David, was a working-class Scot who worked his way up to the rank of major. He was born in Aldershot and lived first in Germany and then in Libya until, at the age of 11, he was sent to a state-run boarding school in Suffolk. McEwan has said in the past that this was quite a bleak time: &quot;I just went numb for four or five years.&quot; On the other hand, his dorm experiences came in handy when, in 2005, he travelled with the environmental group Cape Farewell to Svalbard in the Arctic \u2013 the trip that inspired his last novel, Solar. Not for him the chaos of the bootroom. He kept his stuff safely under his bed. After an English degree at Sussex he went to the University of East Anglia, where he studied for an MA, tutored by Angus Wilson and Malcolm Bradbury. He moved to London in 1974 and became part of the literary set that centred on Ian Hamilton&apos;s New Review (Hamilton, like Wilson, has a walk on part in Sweet Tooth) and the Pillars of Hercules pub in Greek Street, Soho. It was during this time that he formed some of his most important friendships: with Martin Amis, Julian Barnes and Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens died of cancer last year. What is the post-Hitch world like? Oh no. He looks so terrible, as pale as ash, I wish I had not asked. &quot;It&apos;s very\u2026 desolate. It really does feel empty. He was the one of us who seemed to embrace all of literature; as time goes by, I don&apos;t think people will associate him with his taking an unusual line on Iraq. They will connect him with his brilliant essays on writers: Chesterton, Kipling, Wodehouse. The appetite. The conversations. I really do miss them. Martin and I regularly check in with each other in the post-Hitch desert.&quot; How, though, did he manage to stay friends with them all? The literary world can be bitchy and envious. Fall-outs are standard. &quot;Well, we knew each other before we were known; it&apos;s not as if we are movie stars all hanging out together.&quot; Besides, he says, novel-writing isn&apos;t like sprinting. No one needs to come second; there is infinite space for good writing. &quot;And perhaps we&apos;re too old, now, to be jealous. The status anxiety wears off. I like their company. Supper at Julian&apos;s is one of the great pleasures.&quot; But what if one of them had had to slope off and join a less celebrated profession? &quot;It probably would have changed things, yes. Maybe it was a self-selecting group, though. Who would want to hang out around the Pillars of Hercules? Only those bent by this passion for writing books. We were absolutely determined to become writers. We didn&apos;t use words like &apos;passion&apos;, but we acted them out. Writing was the only important thing.&quot; His success came a little later than that of Amis. The early macabre books \u2013 think incest, think murder, think sex with shop mannequins \u2013 were acclaimed and they had their devoted fans, but I don&apos;t imagine they were big sellers (the first came out in 1975). Then, in 1998, his novel Amsterdam won the Booker prize. Nine years later, his 2001 novel Atonement was made into an Oscar-winning film, at which point its already considerable sales doubled, even tripled. Does he think success has an effect on creativity? &quot;Of course it makes a difference,&quot; he says. &quot;But I&apos;ve always done what I want to do, with the result that when I close the door and unhook the phone I feel all the old anxieties associated with trying to get something right.&quot; And there are certain new anxieties. &quot;You worry that sooner or later \u2013 it has to happen \u2013 you can&apos;t write; that you will become less thought-rich; there is the danger of repeating yourself. All writers in their 60s have to confront these things. When should you stop? Do you tail away with a series of feeble novellas? But in the silence of trying to do it, it doesn&apos;t feel different.&quot; He is keen to remind me that Atonement is an anomaly. &quot;It [having a huge hit] happened once. A couple of books recently haven&apos;t earned back their advances, and the advances weren&apos;t that big. Solar, since I&apos;m being frank with you, was loathed by the Americans. It absolutely bombed.&quot; This is no good. If he&apos;s trying, metaphorically speaking, to give me a reality-checking cold shower, it isn&apos;t working. His life, from the outside, seems so replete, so purposeful, so \u2013 not a word one usually associates with writers \u2013 happy. It&apos;s enough to make you sick! He laughs. &quot;Yeah, well, stay with that thought.&quot; And then: &quot;Like lots of people, I made a very good second marriage [to Annalena McAfee, a journalist whom he met when she came to interview him]. We have to learn how to get that right\u2026 and I take a lot of delight in my sons [from his first marriage, to Penny Allen, whom he divorced in 1995]. I thought it would be bleak when they stopped thinking I was God, but I love the unfolding plot of their early adulthood.&quot; One is a molecular biologist, the other is working in PR. You can&apos;t necessarily organise how life works out, he tells me. But still, I can&apos;t help but read his own contentment \u2013 such peace always involves, I think, a certain amount of effort \u2013 as a rebuke to his (now dead) parents. Their marriage was troubled, largely because they were keeping a painful secret: in 2007, McEwan discovered that he had an older brother, Dave Sharp \u2013 the result of an affair between his parents when his mother, Rose, was still married to her first husband (Ernest Wort, with whom she had two children, was off fighting in Italy; her baby with David McEwan was born in 1942; Wort died from combat injuries in 1944). The baby was given away via a newspaper ad in the Reading Mercury which said: &quot;Wanted, Home for Baby Boy, age one month; complete surrender.&quot; &quot;That would have been my father,&quot; says McEwan. &quot;He would have written that ad. &apos;Complete surrender&apos; \u2013 it&apos;s semi-military.&quot; Did he feel cross when he discovered what his parents had done? &quot;Yes. I wanted to shake them. I wanted to say, &apos;Confront this; deal with it, make yourselves happy.&apos; My regret is that they didn&apos;t meet David, because he would have reassured them he wasn&apos;t bitter. One of the first things he [David] said to me was, &apos;I was loved as a child.&apos; He went to visit my mother but she&apos;d already lost her mind. If he&apos;d gone even a year earlier\u2026&quot; It&apos;s such a sad story, given that Rose and David eventually married and could have brought up their child together. &quot;Yes. They closed something down for themselves. Probably that was my father too. I can hear him say it, &apos;What&apos;s done is done.&apos; But my parents&apos; generation\u2026 it took the 60s for people to give themselves permission to talk about things.&quot; Is the presence of his brother in his life (Sharp is a bricklayer) another element of his contentment? I think it must be. Even if they&apos;re not best friends, a flashlight has been shone in the direction of yet another shadow. McEwan doesn&apos;t disagree. &quot;It makes life richer,&quot; he says, quietly. &quot;It absolutely does.&quot; It&apos;s a measure of McEwan&apos;s writerly reputation that, even before publication, Sweet Tooth is causing a fuss; the Booker judges have naughtily neglected to put it on their longlist. &quot;Oh, I&apos;ve become immune to the Booker,&quot; he says, though this is an easy line to take when you&apos;ve already won it. &quot;I think we need something a little more like the Pulitzer prize, where there isn&apos;t this great race. The sense that it&apos;s a 110 yard dash has a streak of vulgarity about it.&quot; As for the reviews, he won&apos;t read them. Does he think, as so many people claim, that we are witnessing the end of publishing and, with it, perhaps, the slow death of the novel itself? &quot;We have a hunger for talking and thinking about others and I don&apos;t think any other form can deliver that insider-ish feeling.&quot; Screen or paper, it doesn&apos;t matter. On the other hand, he&apos;s just moved house \u2013 yes, Henry&apos;s place has been sold, replaced with a flat in Bloomsbury and a house in Gloucestershire \u2013 and he has spent several days pulling books from boxes. &quot;You put them on the shelf and it&apos;s the complete narrative of your existence,&quot; he says. &quot;All these crappy, yellowing paperbacks I bought when I was 17. I&apos;ll never read them again, but I could never throw them away, either.&quot; He hugs himself, trying his best \u2013 mostly for my benefit \u2013 to look neurotic. &quot;I want them around me and that&apos;s not something you can do electronically.&quot; ", "sentences": ["Then, in 1998, his novel Amsterdam won the Booker prize."], "title": "Ian McEwan: 'I had the time of my life'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/19/ian-mcewan-sweet-tooth-interview", "tags": ["Ian McEwan", "Books", "Fiction", "Martin Amis", "Julian Barnes", "Christopher Hitchens", "Philip Roth"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-20T16:44:00Z", "article": " Preamble Good morning. Well, morning. It&apos;s time to assume the position. On 20 August 2001, Mark Butcher played the innings of his life, an astonishing 173 not out as England breezed to a target of 315 to beat the mighty Australia, scoring their runs in just 73.2 overs. On 20 August 2012, they will need a similarly mind-blowing innings if they are to beat South Africa and stay at the top of the world rankings. No, no my breath is not currently held. England, chasing 346, will resume on 16 for two after a traumatic mini-session last night in which both openers were trapped LBW by Vernon Philander. On the equivalent Monday a year ago, England were presented with the ICC mace. Since then England have won three out of 10 Tests. That happy August day, when plenty of people matter-of-factly opined that England would dominate world cricket for the next 5-10 years, seems a long time ago.  &quot;Morning Smyth, morning everybody,&quot; says Josh Robinson. &quot;Is it revisionism of the worst kind to opine that this England side never was the best in the world, and only made it to the top of the ICC rankings because of the number of points they got for beating the India side that had declined substantially from the one that had itself got to the top of the rankings? I say this not in the spirit of I told you so (not least because I didn&apos;t, and was one of those who got rather carried away at the Oval last summer) but to suggest that there might not be all that much to worry about, in the sense that this isn&apos;t a fall from greatness, simply a reminder that the England side is not quite as good as \u2013 but able to compete with \u2013 a genuinely good South African side.&quot; The long answer is yes. When South Africa got 398 for one on the first day at Edgbaston in 2003, Duncan Fletcher said something like &quot;Good players are allowed to score hundreds against you.&quot; By the same token, bloody good teams are allowed to outplay you in a series. England have a few issues to resolve but to suggest they were never that good in the first place is tedious nonsense.  In case you missed it yesterday, this is great.  &quot;Ouch,&quot; replies Josh Robinson. &quot;Not &apos;never that good&apos;. Competitive with the best sides in the world. Up there in the top two or three. Just not the best in the world, and certainly not by some margin.&quot; Right now, no, South Africa are clearly better. But was that the case a year ago? I&apos;m not so sure. Don&apos;t forget that, before this summer, South Africa had won only three of their last nine series. They even mlost a Test at home to a Murali-less Sri Lanka, which is an embarrassment. They have been much better in this series \u2013 only a fool would argue otherwise \u2013 but I think the 2010-11 England would have been their equal.  Something to talk about today Let&apos;s discuss the issue on the lips of every single person in the country: overground train seat etiquette. Why do people who secure seats make it clear with such aggression that they don&apos;t want anyone else in the same postal district? And why do so many people stand for their 47-minute journey rather than utter the words, &quot;Can I sit there please?&quot; The most amusing approach came from a semi-drunken friend who, upon seeing a bad that was taking up two seats, said brusquely to its owner, &quot;You&apos;re gonna have to move that.&quot;  14th over: South Africa 16-2 (target: 346; Trott 6, Bell 4) It&apos;s overcast at Lord&apos;s, with the lights on. In short, a lovely morning for bowling. If England lose a couple early on this could be over in a hurry. There are few things in cricket as demoralising as batting to save a game you needed to win. You often see a collapse in such circumstances \u2013 think Antigua 1998 and Lahore 2005. Morkel starts with a fine maiden to Bell, including one sharp delivery that is fiddled on the bounce to slip. &quot;If you want to keep the seat next to you open,&quot; begins Martin Crosoer, &quot;make eye contact with the individual approaching it, smile, and stroke the seat\u2026&quot; Rubbing your thigh with the other hand is optional.  15th over: South Africa 23-2 (target: 346; Trott 8, Bell 4) Vernon Philander, who bowled a devastating spell last night, beats Trott with a stunning delivery that lifts and seams away sharply. A peach of an awayswinger also beats Trott \u2013 and AB de Villiers, which means a bye for England. The next ball also beats de Villiers, this time scooting away for four byes. &quot;How should the England management rebuild?&quot; says Dave Ferguson. &quot;From numbers 1 to 11 who&apos;s world class and who do we need to replace? Keep Cook, Bell, Prior, Anderson and Broad and ditch the rest? Or is it more a question of tactics than players?&quot; A lot depends on what Strauss does. If he continues, I&apos;d keep the same pool of players for India. I don&apos;t think anyone deserves to be dumped, although they will have an eye on the form of a few players. It&apos;s time to make Finn a regular though. The tour party for India might be something like: Strauss, Cook, Trott, Taylor, Bairstow, Bopara, Bell, Prior, Davies, Swann, Panesar, Tredwell, Broad, Anderson, Finn, Bresnan, Onions.  16th over: South Africa 24-2 (target: 346; Trott 9, Bell 4) Trott is beaten by consecutive deliveries from Morkel, the first short and the second full. South Africa are all over England at the moment. In other news, Iain Chambers has thumped the tub so hard that it gave him a rhyme in return:  &quot;They call me a dopeBut got faith like the popeBall after ballWill go over the ropeCatches go downSlippery like soapKeep on believingCoz there&apos;s always... Oh sod it! All over by 3 o&apos;clock&quot;   17th over: South Africa 29-2 (target: 346; Trott 14, Bell 4) Trott won&apos;t last long here. He is struggling badly and has just edged Philander over the leaping third slip for four. There is yet another play and miss later in the over, a wild cover drive at an awayswinger. &quot;Much as I wish it was South Africa who were 23-2 this morning and chasing a stratospherically high target, I believe it is in fact unfortunately England who are that position,&quot; says Daviid Roberts. &quot;I&apos;d suggest you altered the score headline of each over to reflect that grim reality.&quot; You do realise you&apos;re reading the Guardian don&apos;t you?  18th over: England 34-2 (target: 346; Trott 18, Bell 4) Trott plays and misses for the 97th time this morning, although in his defence this was a storming lifter from Morkel. The next ball is flashed behind point for four. Trott is playing extremely aggressively this morning. Quite right too. There&apos;s no point England hanging around for a draw here. &quot;The other thing to bear in mind with these rankings is that they are calculated over a period of several (three?) years,&quot; says Mike Jakeman. &quot;So it&apos;s quite feasible that the world number one might be a side that has been excellent for a few years but is fading once they reach the top. Like India 2011. Of course, this would become a much easier argument if the ICC introduced the World Test Championship. Which they should.&quot; I&apos;m all for a Test Championship, but even then you&apos;d have people saying that the best team doesn&apos;t always win a cup competition, which is an argument that has some merit. It&apos;s far better to just use your eyes I suppose. England were the best team in the world a year ago. South Africa are the best team in the world now.  WICKET! England 34-3 (Bell c Smith b Philander 4) My colleague Barry Glendenning is cackling maniacally and that can only mean one thing: Ian Bell has gone. He threw the bat at a wide, shortish outswinger from Philander that flew off the edge to Graeme Smith at first slip. A fairly straightforward chance slipped out of his grasp, but he was able to clutch it at the second attempt. Philander has wonderful figures of three for 11.  19th over: England 36-3 (target: 346; Trott 18, Taylor 2) &quot;I never block my seat with a bag: it&apos;s the height of rudeness,&quot; says Simon Bell. &quot;It&apos;s not even necessary. The two-litre bottle of super-strength cider in front of me seems to keep most people away.&quot;  20th over: England 39-3 (target: 346; Trott 21, Taylor 2) Trott times Morkel nicely through midwicket for three. That brings James Taylor on strike. Whether he lasts 10 balls or 200, this will be one of the more important tutorials of his Test career. &quot;Few things annoy me more than seat nazism,&quot; says Guy Hornsby. &quot;We&apos;ve all sat down with a bag on a seat in a quiet carriage, but most of us are more than happy to move around should it be needed, but some people&apos;s willingness to act deaf/mute to hold their territory is teeth-gnashingly infuriating. There&apos;s an astounding lack of shoe-on-the-other-foot understanding here as well. If it was the other way round, they&apos;d be covering you in spittle in high-visibility seat rage, but it&apos;s fine for them to stare at their paper while you shuffle past, no doubt tutting as you do so. The same goes for people that sit on the outside seat and don&apos;t move in, people that stand by a door and block entrance to a carriage, and god forbid, want to get on like their life depended on it, even when you&apos;re still trying to get out. Dammit Smyth, I was in a GOOD mood until you opened this pandora&apos;s box. Now I need a walk round the block.&quot;  21st over: England 40-3 (target: 346; Trott 22, Taylor 2) &quot;I am very much a glass-half-empty type of person but one just has to accept the Boks are a phenomenal side,&quot; says David Brown. &quot;Their bowling attack has a wonderful balance to it and their batsmen&apos;s Test averages show what a serious run-making unit they are. The only surprising thing is that they have not dominated the Test arena for the last few years as their only newish addition is Philander.&quot; Yes, they do seem to save their best for England. It&apos;s staggering to think a team this good could be thrashed at home by Sri Lanka, and it&apos;s weird that they&apos;ve won only three of their last nine Test series. Their pace attack, as you say, is one of the most beautifully balanced we&apos;ve ever seen. Any nominations for a more balanced high-class pace attack?  22nd over: England 40-3 (target: 346; Trott 22, Taylor 2) Here comes Dale Steyn to bowl to his bunny Jonathan Trott. A Sky graphic tells us that, in this series, Trott is 39 for three against Steyn, and I don&apos;t think he was much better in the 2009-10. Trott is beaten, yet again, and shouts &quot;fuckin hell&quot; to no one in particular. The next ball brings a biggish shout for a catch down the leg side, but Simon Taufel isn&apos;t interested. It was straight off the thigh pad. &quot;I hate train seat hogs so much that I purposely ask to sit next to them even when there are double seats free around them,&quot; says  Walter Mitty  Richard Marsden. &quot;Then I sit there hating them for their selfishness and myself for waging such a self-defeating crusade. But based on the principle that it&apos;s better to pursue unhappiness for others than happiness for yourself, on balance I&apos;d say it&apos;s worth it.&quot;  23rd over: England 40-3 (target: 346; Trott 22, Taylor 2) Even though we don&apos;t really get to see his work, we shouldn&apos;t underestimate the role of Gary Kirsten in all this. Look what&apos;s happened to India since he left. Everything points to him being a seriously good coach. South Africa&apos;s tactics against a number of England players \u2013 Strauss, Cook, Trott, Bell, Prior, Swann \u2013 have been brilliant. Crucially, they&apos;ve had the players to implement those plans. Philander temps Taylor into a loose drive that flies off the edge but short of third slip. A maiden.  24th over: England 40-3 (target: 346; Trott 22, Taylor 2) I think England came out intent on forcing the issue, but South Africa&apos;s excellence means they have little option but to defend. It&apos;s another maiden from Steyn to Trott. Steyn has figures of 7-4-4-0. &quot;Should we be too surprised at England being knocked off the top of Testcricket&apos;s tree?&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Perhaps the West Indies and then Australia producing two or three great sides back-to-back has seduced us into believing that dynasties are the norm. They&apos;re not. Even though Test cricket has a very limited number of nations playing, the differences in conditions around the world, the sheer hard work of bowling fast (the best way to win Test matches) and the years it takes for a batsman to establish himself fully (think Steve Waugh or Ian Bell), means that few sides dominate for years. I saw a graph once that proved this, but I can&apos;t find it online.&quot; Yep, this is spot on. And it could well change hands again by the end of the year, depending on India v England and Australia v South Africa. If Australia win that series \u2013 which will be a stormer \u2013 they will go top.  25th over: England 41-3 (target: 346; Trott 22, Taylor 3) Kallis comes on for Morkel. His first ball is a ridiculous jaffa to Taylor that angles in and then boings away down the slope. That almost seamed square. Don Bradman might just have got an edge on it; Taylor didn&apos;t. &quot;There was a brief window of opportunity during which Pakistan could have fielded Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Asif, Mohammed Amir and Umar Gul together (I don&apos;t know if they ever did),&quot; says Ranil Dissanayake. &quot;Had they, it would have been, respectively: fastest bowler in the world, best seam bowler in the world, best left-armer in the world and the best reverse-swinger in the world. That has to be worth a shout. Of course, there is a school of thought that the most balanced bowling attack ever was Malcolm Marshall. Swing, pace, seam, aggression and accuracy.&quot; Ha, how true.  WICKET! England 45-4 (Taylor run out 4) Farce, welcome home, English cricket has missed you. Come here Farce, give us a big hug. It&apos;s been too long. Trott pinged Steyn towards cow corner and ran three. Taylor wanted a fourth and set off but Trott, who originally started to run, then changed his mind and that meant both batsmen ended up at the bowler&apos;s end. The throw came in to Steyn, who got it down the other end for AB de Villiers to break the stumps as Taylor desperately tried and failed to complete his unexpected shuttle run. That was utterly ridiculous.  26th over: England 45-4 (target: 346; Trott 22, Bairstow 0) Well that&apos;s the end of England&apos;s chase. Plenty thought we&apos;d hear another that begins with &apos;Ch&apos; this summer. The only thing South Africa have choked is the England top order. &quot;I sat on someone&apos;s bag once because their ignorance to the rest of the crammed carriage infuriated me,&quot; says Edward Knapp. &quot;They could see the rest of us were like sardines but chose to leave the bag on the seat, so I sat on it. I swiftly got off at the next stop because the tryant of abuse I received from the bag&apos;s owner. Apparently he was upset because the bag contained his son&apos;s 9th birthday cake. This is a tip to anyone who is taking home their children&apos;s birthday cake \u2013 don&apos;t leave it in a bag, on a seat in the middle of rush hour, especially when there is a hot, irritable fat man is desperate need of a seat standing next to you.&quot;  27th over: England 45-4 (target: 346; Trott 22, Bairstow 0) &quot;TMS is putting the blame for the run out on Trott,&quot; says Amy Clements. &quot;What&apos;s your verdict Smyth?&quot; I blame KP.  28th over: England 52-4 (target: 346; Trott 29, Bairstow 3) Bairstow, trying to drive that deadly straight outswinger from Steyn, gets a thick edge through point for three, and then Trott slaps four to third man. The camera cuts to Graham Gooch on the balcony. He&apos;s inadvertently doing a Bruce Forsyth pose, his fist pressed against his forehead. No, he&apos;s not smiling and shouting &apos;Nice to see you, to see you nice&apos;. &quot;If memory serves me right,&quot; says Alex Bishop, &quot;this isn&apos;t the first time Trott&apos;s been involved in a run out?&quot; Indeed. It&apos;s a bit like saying &apos;If memory serves me right, this isn&apos;t the first time Joey Barton has made a plonker of himself on Twitter&apos;.  29th over: England 61-4 (target: 346; Trott 37, Bairstow 4) Kallis overpitches a fraction and is square-driven handsomely for four by Trott. And now he&apos;s been dropped! Trott sliced a drive to the right of Rudolph at third slip, who couldn&apos;t hang on to a diving chance. He should have held that. You&apos;ve just dropped the ICC mace, pal! &quot;Balanced pace attack,&quot; says Dan Smith. &quot;Lee/McGrath/Warne/Gillespie. End of story.&quot; Warne was a demon quickie, Spofforthesque at times.  30th over: England 69-4 (target: 346; Trott 37, Bairstow 12) Bairstow is beaten on the inside by Steyn \u2013 no idea how that missed the stumps \u2013\u00a0and then drives through the crouching Morkel at extra cover for four. He gets another boundary with a crisp clip off the pads. England have scored 24 from the last three overs. South Africa are really on the rack now. &quot;Best example of bad seat etiquette was on a train from Schiphol to Amsterdam central station,&quot; says Matthew Valentine. &quot;Carriage was virtually empty apart from one woman and a group of 4 of us. My bag was too big to fit on overhead storage so I put it on a seat. The woman asked me to take my bag off the seat and when I turned to her she had both her bags on seat next to her. I said I would if she&apos;d do the same, to which she replied that hers were ok as they were clean and did not have wheels. I told her my bag was also clean and that once she removed her bags from the seat I would do the same. She didn&apos;t, so neither did I.&quot; And you&apos;re still together, right?  31st over: England 71-4 (target: 346; Trott 39, Bairstow 12) Trott, trying to drive Kallis, edges this far short of the diving Amla at backward point. &quot;Ok, so it was a very brief moment, but surely Harmison, Hoggard, Flintoff and Jones?&quot; says Alex Burrage. &quot;Pace, swing, aggression and reverse swing.&quot;  32nd over: England 79-4 (target: 346; Trott 39, Bairstow 20) Another edge from Bairstow off Steyn drops short of the slips and then scuttles away for four. He gets his fourth boundary later in the over and it&apos;s easily the best of them, a delightful push down the ground. Bairstow has 20 from 15 balls. &quot;I think we all know that most balanced pace attack all wore the maroon cap,&quot; says Paddy Blewer. &quot;For my money: Marshall, Ambrose, Bishop, Walsh \u2013 bearing in mind I wasn&apos;t around to really see Holding etc, and Sylvers Clarke was banned. Sure, the Saffers are very good, as was England a year ago, but to compare either to the horsemen of the apocalypse is silly. Fun but silly.&quot; Oh crikey, we were only talking about balance. This South Africa attack is brilliant but nobody would compare them to the attack you mentioned above, or Holding, Croft, Roberts and Garner.  33rd over: England 79-4 (target: 346; Trott 39, Bairstow 20) A maiden from Kallis. &quot;When I was 7, my dad thought it&apos;d be a good idea to tell me what he would do in the event of a nuclear war (some might call this unorthodox parenting, but not me, I was only 7): he told me he&apos;d sit in the garden and have a glass of wine,&quot; says Olly Lambert. &quot;For some reason I&apos;m reminded of this advice as I glance at the score. Corkscrews at the ready, everyone outside...&quot;  34th over: England 87-4 (target: 346; Trott 39, Bairstow 28) Morkel replaces Steyn, who was smashed out of the attack by Trott and Bairstow and is palpably past his best. Morkel has a big shout for LBW when Bairstow whips around a full delivery angled in towards him. Simon Taufel says not out but South Africa decide to review the decision. I suspect this will be &apos;umpire&apos;s call&apos; and therefore not out. Yep, it was just clipping the outside of the leg stump, so the original decision stands. Bairstow pulls brilliantly through midwicket for four to move to 28 from 20 balls. I suppose I just probably type &apos;#silverlining&apos; at this point, eh? Eh? &quot;I was once on a train where the conductor announced that any bags on seats in a carriage where others were standing would be charged the full adult single fare,&quot; says Martin Kane. &quot;This drew wonderful sheepish expressions from those who then had to move their bags (generally attempting to do so without anyone noticing). Never mind your Olympic medallists \u2013 this man was a true hero. Incidentally, Southern users might also be familiar with the middle seat conundrum (where the configuration is rows of three). Those who sit on the outside of such rows (leaving the middle seat free) are often even more militant and protective than &apos;baggers&apos;.&quot;  35th over: England 98-4 (target: 346; Trott 40, Bairstow 37) Tahir comes on for Kallis. His third ball is tossed up invitingly. Bairstow accepts the invitation and swipes it gloriously down the ground for a one-bounce four. He sweeps very fine for four more later in the over to bring up the fifty partnership in great time. This is a cracking little cameo; Bairstow has 37 from just 24 balls. I think I may be falling in love with you, Jonny Bairstow. &quot;Most balanced pace attack,&quot; says Nick Hughes. &quot;Igglesden, McCague, Headley, Fleming, Ealham. Case closed.&quot; I think I may be falling in love with you, Nick Hughes.  36th over: England 104-4 (target: 346; Trott 46, Bairstow 38) Trott steers Morkel through the slips for four to bring up the hundred. The crowd are cheering every boundary heartily. There have been a few in the last half an hour; in the last nine overs England have scored 59 runs. No, not it&apos;s not going to happen, but we can still enjoy watching a thoroughly likeable young man give full expression to his considerable talent. Mind you, if England somehow find themselves 200 for four at 3pm... &quot;Our school bus driver in the 80s used to come up to the top deck and bellow &apos;If yer want a seat for yer bag, yer can pay fer it&apos;,&quot; says Dan Smith. &quot;TfL should have that as their official policy.&quot;  37th over: England 109-4 (target: 346; Trott 48, Bairstow 41) Tahir goes around the wicket and into the rough. Bairstow continues to attack, charging a full toss and whipping it for a single. He has 41 from 29 balls and could be on for one of the faster Test fifties. The fastest, of course, are belong to Ian Botham, from 28 and 32 balls. &quot;New Zealand circa mid/late 90s \u2013 McMillan, Harris, Larsen, Astle \u2013 dibble, dobble, liquorice and all-sorts,&quot; says Grant Harrison. In the 1992 World Cup there was Harris, Larsen and Latham, who were known as Dibbly, Dobbly and Wobbly. (Latham was definitely wobbly.) The three tortoises of the apocalypse.  38th over: England 111-4 (target: 346; Trott 49, Bairstow 42) A big nipbacker from Morkel hits Trott on the pad and lands just short of de Villiers. Morkel thought there was an edge but replays suggested otherwise. As Shaun Pollock says on Sky, the lunch break will be good for South Africa. Bairstow&apos;s approach has caught them on the hop. Never mind balanced pace attacks, Noor Jivraj reminds us of the ultimate balanced spin attack: Prasanna, Venkat, Chandra and Bedi.  39th over: England 114-4 (target: 346; Trott 52, Bairstow 42) Trott pushes Tahir for two to reach a much needed half century. He was all over the place early on but has played pretty well since running out James Taylor. Tahir skips a quicker one past Bairstow&apos;s inside edge and onto the pad\u00a0\u2013 it pitched outside leg \u2013 before beating him with a beautiful legspinner. &quot;Ah, Chris Harris,&quot; says SB Tang. &quot;Only New Zealand could give the world a bald, slow-medium international bowler. He was reasonably effective too, especially in ODIs, with an economy rate of 4.28 and an average of 37.50.&quot; He was exasperatingly effective. That&apos;s an outstanding economy rate, even in the 1990s.  40th over: England 120-4 (target: 346; Trott 57, Bairstow 43) Trott edges Morkel along the ground for four. Are any of our South Africa readers getting worried yet? I really wouldn&apos;t; there&apos;s no way this can happen. But just for the record, as we go to lunch, England need a further 226 from 63 overs. If they do somehow pull it off, let&apos;s all meet in a field and drink celebratory drink until the sun comes up on Thursday morning. It&apos;ll be the inaugural Bairstow Festival. So far Trott and the fearless Bairstow have added 75 in 14 overs. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session. I&apos;ll leave you with this from Dan Lucas. &quot;These two haven&apos;t seen Clockwise, have they?&quot;  LUNCH  The English view &quot;Of course, we won&apos;t do it, but\u2026 if the positions were reversed, and South Africa were chasing, at what point would you get that ice-cube-down-the-spine feeling?&quot; says Steve Hudson. &quot;Pretty soon?&quot; If they get to 200 for four. Only then would I start lifting grannies&apos; handbags on the off chance they contain beta-blockers.  The South African view &quot;Yes, Rob, some South Africans who are reading the cricket ARE getting worried,&quot; says Simon Pamphilon. &quot;Well, at least one of us is.&quot;  The alternative English view, from a lunatic &quot;226 in 2 sessions with 6 wickets remaining?&quot; says Si Begley. &quot;This is ON!!!!! Anyone got the number for the Swedish women&apos;s handball team to see what shade of red they want to paint this town tonight?&quot;  41st over: England 123-4 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 58, Bairstow 45) This is very surprising: Graeme Smith has decided to open the bowling after lunch with  Dame Judi Dench  Imran Tahir. He&apos;s bowling into the rough from over the wicket, and England take three-low risk singles. &quot;Re train seats \u2013 the opposite effect can be had by getting on along-ish distance train journey with a fresh take-away pizza,&quot; says Amy Clements. &quot;I did this last week from Newcastle - London and was immediately mobbed by a load of (well, three) pissed Northern blokes. They didn&apos;t get thepizza off me though, oh no. I did however have to endure one of saidpissed blokes dribbling in the seat next to me whilst I scoffed it.&quot; And you&apos;re still together, right?  42nd over: England 132-4 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 59, Bairstow 52) Philander has a big shout for LBW when Bairstow whips around the front pad. Runs were given by Simon Taufel, but there didn&apos;t seem to be an inside edge. Doesn&apos;t matter as it was going down and bouncing over. A flick to fine leg for four brings Bairstow to an intrepid, heartwarming half-century from only 41 deliveries.  &quot;Hell, I like Si Begley,&quot; says Matt Dony. &quot;He seems like a good man to have on hand in a crisis. Not that he&apos;d necessarily actually do anything, but you can&apos;t put a price on that kind of positivity. It&apos;s palpably not &apos;on&apos; yet, but he almost convinced me. Almost.&quot;  WICKET! England 134-5 (Bairstow b Tahir 54) That Hives song. I told you it couldn&apos;t happen. And I told you bowling Tahir was the wrong move. A-hem. He has skidded one right through Jonny Bairstow and into the stumps, a superb piece of bowling that prompts some champion in the Guardian to instinctively exclaim &quot;Effing hell&quot;. Sorry.  43rd over: England 134-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 60, Prior 0) Actually, seeing that dismissal again, it kept a bit low and almost went under the bat. Bairstow was back when he should have been forward and ultimately that did for him. But it was still good bowling, flat, quick and skipping into the off stump.  44th over: England 134-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 60, Prior 0) A maiden from Philander to Trott. &quot;Am I missing something here?&quot; says Tom Atkins. &quot;Someone puts their bag on a seat when the train&apos;s not busy because either a) it&apos;s heavy and difficult to put in the overhead storage or b) they might want to get something out of it later. Train gets busy. Someone else goes up to said person and says &apos;Can I sit there please&apos;. Person puts bag somewhere else. How socially inept are all these people that they can&apos;t politely ask someone to move their bag?&quot; You clearly haven&apos;t had The Look.  45th over: England 134-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 60, Prior 0) Tahir has caused Prior a few problems in this series, and gets one to spit viciously out of the rough onto the body. Tahir thought it hit glove and was screaming for someone to catch the darn thing, but they didn&apos;t and it didn&apos;t.  46th over: England 136-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 61, Prior 1) Trott flicks Philander off middle stump for a single. Philander was a quarter of the way through his appeal when the bat came down at the last possible minute. That would have been plumb. &quot;Did Tom Atkins (44th over) just ask how socially inept OBO readers are?&quot; asks David Hopkins. &quot;He&apos;s new around here isn&apos;t he?&quot;  47th over: England 138-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 61, Prior 3) Prior drives Tahir down the ground for two. It was in the air for a while, and Tahir is making life pretty difficult out of the rough. There are no risk-free attacking shots. &quot;Things have changed. in the late 60s: my sister, a pretty teenager,&quot; remembers GRAEME POLLOCK giving up his seat for her on the bus,&quot; says Kallie Hanekom. &quot;Thus was soon after his magnificent Test hundred before lunch at Trent Bridge.&quot;  48th over: England 138-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 61, Prior 3) Trott flicks around the pad at Philander, prompting a huge LBW shout. Simon Taufel says not out and Philander immediately signals for the review \u2013 but only the captain can do that. Smith comically turns his back on Philnander and, after a long discussion with Kallis and de Villiers, decides not to review. Vern doesn&apos;t like that, Vern&apos;s got a face on him, but Smith was right: Hawkeye shows it was bouncing over the stumps. That was very funny. Philander was desperate to review it, and Smith only just stopped short of the full David Brent &apos;Not interested!&apos; &quot;On the subject of train seats, people need to stop bothering with any semblance of politeness,&quot; says Neil Taylor. &quot;Dependent on my mood, I either say &apos;Hup hup&apos; to get people to move their bags or just sit on said bag. Someone did get a bit sniffy with me when I did that when the train was full of Great Britain supporters after one of the rowing events. I apologised saying that I didn&apos;t see it as I couldn&apos;t imagine anybody would be selfish enough to have their bag on the seat when the train was so busy. Fluster from him, smirks all round from everybody else. Be brutal people, together we can stamp this out.&quot;  49th over: England 138-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 61, Prior 3) &quot;I&apos;m going to make myself a mixtape of your OBO chortling to listen to when ahm glum,&quot; says Georgina Turner to my left. Most of us are cocooned under headphones for MBMs/OBOs and are so thus make a few noises that you don&apos;t usually hear in a busy office. I reckon if I heard a tape of the exclamations I make during an OBO I&apos;d be too embarrassed to ever leave the house again.  50th over: England 142-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 62, Prior 6) The sun is out at Lord&apos;s now. I was just about to type that conditions might be better for batting when Philander seamed an awesome delivery past Prior&apos;s outside edge. He&apos;s got a very good case for the Man of the Match award here, as brilliant as Amla&apos;s century was. South Africa&apos;s seamers are bowling very straight to Prior, as in the first innings.  51st over: England 146-5 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Trott 63, Prior 9) You can win a Test from this position \u2013 Australia&apos;s win over Pakistan at Hobart in 1999 is the precedent \u2013 but realistically only two results are possible now, not least because scoring out of the rough is so difficult. Prior drives pleasantly through the covers for a couple. &quot;I got onto a train to London to find my carriage full of stag-do inebriates, one of whom occupied my reserved seat,&quot; says Iain Chambers. &quot;After tense negotiations, I secured my seat and set about my chosen lunch, a manly portion of sushi. After they&apos;d alighted at Doncaster, the Scottish fellow opposite me explained they&apos;d been calling him &apos;The Professor&apos; since Newcastle. &quot;I think it&apos;s because I was reading a book&quot;. He was quite phlegmatic about their uncouth behaviour. Me? I think they were a bunch of cu... ooh, how&apos;s Matty Prior doing?&quot; You got lucky. In Trainspotting, somebody found his reserved seat taken by Francis Begbie, and unwisely endeavoured to rectify the situation.  WICKET! England 146-6 (Trott c Kallis b Steyn 63) What a catch from Jacques Kallis! Dale Steyn has struck with the first ball of a new spell \u2013 and it&apos;s his bunny Trott once again. It was a nasty delivery that got big on Trott, who could only edge an attempted cut stroke. The ball raced off the edge towards second slip and Kallis \u2013 with a reaction time of approximately 0.0000000002 seconds \u2013 moved high to his left like a goalkeeper to take a sensational two-handed catch. That really is breathtaking. Steyn has dismissed Trott six times in Test cricket now; he gleefully shows four fingers and two thumbs to his teammates and says &quot;that&apos;s six times&quot;.  52nd over: England 153-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 9, Broad 7) Broad is going to go down swinging; he already has sevn from five balls. &quot;And there is the difference,&quot; says Brad McMillan. &quot;We would have put that catch down in this series.&quot; England have dropped nine catches in this series. Three of them (Amla in the first Test, Petersen in the second and Amla here) cost almost 550 runs.  53rd over: England 158-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 10, Broad 11) Facing Tahir out of the rough will be even harder for the left-handed Broad. One of John Buchanan&apos;s ambidextrous cricketers would definitely play right-handed here. The first ball Broad faces is inside edge just wide of the diving Amla at short leg. &quot;Ah, Hobart 1999,&quot; says SB Tang. &quot;I was still in high school in Melbourne. Our teachers stopped class to let us watch the match. I seem to recall that even proceedings in federal parliament were hurried along to enable MPs to watch the impending miracle. And who can forget Justin Langer&apos;s incredible creaking bat handle!?&quot;  54th over: England 170-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 10, Broad 23) Broad is going to give it some humpty, which has to be the right approach. He top edges a pull for four off Steyn, who responds with a clever slower ball that beats Broad&apos;s attempt to launch it so far that it lands in someone&apos;s pint in The Good Mixer in Camden. Broad middles one later in the over, pulling a mighty six over square leg. Twelve from the over! &quot;My Dad once sat on two chaps on their way back from That London because they were blocking the middle seat of a three-seat group with their widely spread knees (to make room for their massive &quot;bags&quot;, obviously) and they didn&apos;t move fast enough when he said &apos;excuse me&apos;,&quot; says Louise Wright. &quot;Fortunately he looks a bit like the kind of wizened chap that might have secret ninja skills, so he escaped unscathed.&quot;  55th over: England 174-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 14, Broad 23) Prior premeditates the reverse sweep and gets Tahir away to third man for four. Tahir responds with one of the worst LBW appeals in history; the ball pitched 14 miles outside leg stump. Although, as Mike Atherton says on Sky, we&apos;ve seen then given in the days before DRS, most notably with that hilarious Alec Stewart dismissal in Galle in 2000-01. I wish I could find that on YouTube. The Gaffer&apos;s face was priceless. &quot;If you don&apos;t want someone to sit next to you on a long cramped National Express coach journey, just sit there with a slightly mad look on your face while people are boarding,&quot; says Tom Ireland. &quot;Works every time.&quot; Or just read the Guardian.  56th over: England 176-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 15, Broad 23) Two from Steyn&apos;s over. It&apos;s not often the case that Matt Prior is the straight man, but that&apos;s been the case in this short partnership. He has 15 from 39 balls, Broad 24 from 18. &quot;England appear not to be going down fighting exactly, but going down entertaining, which in the circumstances I think is absolutely the right call,&quot; says Sarah Bacon. It&apos;s the Australian way.  57th over: England 179-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 18, Broad 24) The crowd have anointed Imran Tahir as pantomime villain after he deliberately pulled out of his delivery stride in the previous over, and there are zesty, liquor-fuelled cheers when Prior drives him for three. Then Broad smashes a pull onto the helmet of the ducking Amla at short leg. Thank goodness for helmets, eh. Mind you, in 1995 a helmetless Nick Knight was smashed on the head at silly point. &quot;I don&apos;t like people sitting next to me on the train, so if I have a bag I put it on the seat next to me especially if the train is crowded, then pretend I don&apos;t notice people scouting around for seats, only moving the bag if I think I might be physically assaulted,&quot; says Steve Hudson. &quot;I know this is unpleasant and wrong, but whatever.&quot;  58th over: England 183-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 22, Broad 24) Prior opens the face to steer Steyn wide of the slips for four. When he fails to put away a cover drive later in the over, Prior exclaims, &quot;Oh, Matthew. Here&apos;s Sara Torvalds. &quot;A friend of mine at uni used to be so annoyed with people unable to say &apos;Excuse me&apos; (and trust me, Finns are even worse at it than your average Brit \u2013 I can even prove it to you linguistically: we are so averse to the smallest bit of polite conversation that Finnish has no word for &apos;Please&apos;) that whenever she got the aisle seat on a train or bus, she&apos;d close her eyes as soon as she realised the person in the window seat wanted to get off, just to force them to open their mouth instead of silently indicating that this was their stop.&quot; In its own way, that&apos;s almost as heroic as the work of Grammar Man.  59th over: England 184-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 22, Broad 25) The crowd are slow-clapping Tahir every time he comes into bowl. An optimistic LBW shout is turned down, with Broad outside the line of off stump. England, for the record, need 162 from 44 overs. If only they were chasing 280 rather than 346. &quot;Not sure how sympathetic the OBO would be to this, but on a stag do up to Newcastle, we had reserved seats scattered through a carriage, with 3 of 4 round a table,&quot; says Tim Gibbs. &quot;On getting on the train, the 4th seat was taken by a woman on her own. Being early in proceedings and thinking we were doing the gentlemanly thing we offered to swap that seat with one of our friends who was way down the carriage but the woman steadfastly refused to move, and so had to endure 3 hours of &quot;witty&quot; conversation and drinking games before getting off in a huff. I don&apos;t think she finished her sudoku puzzle that evening. Were we in the wrong? And no, unfortunately we are no longer together.&quot; So you were the ones Amy Clements was going on about in the 41st over.  60th over: England 187-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 23, Broad 27) Morkel comes back to replace Steyn. Six balls, three singles. There has been a bit of niggle between Broad, Steyn and Morkel, possibly over Morkel&apos;s follow through. Simon Taufel has a quiet word with Broad and Prior. &quot;Before this series, I thought Big Vern Philander was a Hoggy-lite - swung itfrom the hand without much nip and had got lucky as batsmen relaxed a little on being away from all-time great Steyn and headhunter Morkel,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Part of me still thinks that, but another part marvels at his discipline and consistency, always making the batsman play (or, at the very least, making him decide late to leave it). And his batting, that I expected to be a bit of long-handled slogging from 9, has been perfectly judged for the match situation from 8. Gary Kirsten certainly knows a player and certainly knows how to get the most from a player.&quot;  61st over: England 190-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 23, Broad 30) Broad is beaten by a wonderful googly from Tahir. &quot;Did you know,&quot; begins my sort of colleague John Crace, &quot;that opposite your OBO, the Guardian is offering readers the chance to book England Test cricket tickets for Thursday 1 January 1970.&quot; Oh my goodness, so we are. Roll up, roll up, get your DeLoreans here. In the best Guardian traditions, we can&apos;t even get a cock-up right: England didn&apos;t play any Test cricket in the winter of 1969-70.  62nd over: England 193-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 24, Broad 32) Broad slaps Morkel over the top and just away from Duminy, running back from point. The crowd are cheering and booing everything now; they are either demob happy, seriously flootered or both.  63rd over: England 194-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 24, Broad 33) Tahir bowls in the rough, Prior kicks him away. One from the over.  64th over: England 198-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 25, Broad 36) Broad misses an almighty drive at Morkel. &quot;Everyone&apos;s a winner!&quot; chuckles Bumble on Sky. Another huge swipe brings a couple to backward point \u2013 and with it a proud fifty partnership from 74 balls. England&apos;s target i- ah, forget it. &quot;Just like elite sport, the seat-on-a-train-occupied-by-a-bag conundrum is played out 90% in the minds of the antagonists,&quot; says Peter McLeod. &quot; On a good day, I can stride up to to the offending seat, lean over a wee bit (but not enough to be, like, intimidating) toward the bag&apos;s owner and brusquely but politely enquire &apos;mind if I sit here?&apos; This invariably leads to hasty rectification of the situation and a pleasant, comfortable journey. But there are also those days where I&apos;m not quite in the interacting-with-other-people &apos;zone&apos; and the train carriage morphs into a deadly field of traps, snares and unencouragingly positioned eyebrows. Those are the journeys spent wondering at the length of time it takes to go even one measly stop and trying to work out where you went wrong in life.  65th over: England 199-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 26, Broad 36) There are around 20 minutes to tea. Tahir continues to keep Prior quiet by dumping it in the rough. Prior has 26 from 73 balls; very slow by his standards. I suppose his plan to just stick in the game for as long as possible, and then go all Astle on South Africa&apos;s ass if England have even an outside chance.  66th over: England 204-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 30, Broad 37) Kallis, on for Morkel, beats Prior with consecutive deliveries. Prior&apos;s riposte is a splendid back-foot drive for three to bring up the 200. Do not dare think it, never mind email it. &quot;Hasn&apos;t this Test been great?&quot; says Piers Barclay. &quot;Almost every day, it&apos;s managed to offer us that tiny hint that Hope&apos;s approaching the door \u2013 54-4 (their one, obviously), Finn&apos;s little burst yesterday, Bairstow today \u2013 and then brilliantly struck her down, until the next time you imagine there might be half a chance we can win. And today, it keeps tempting me to leave the office and head to Lord&apos;s, but we all know that the second I get on the Jubilee line, we&apos;ll lose the last four wickets simultaneously, so I won&apos;t. Selfless, I know.&quot;  It&apos;s been a wonderful Test match. Arguably not quite a great Test \u2013 it needed England to get a bit closer to the target for that \u2013 but still one of the better Tests involving England since 2005.  67th over: England 2045-6 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 31, Broad 37) Prior continues to kick Tahir away and work the odd single. He&apos;s scored 15 from 55 balls against him in this innings, as compared to 16 off 28 against the quicks. &quot;COME ON ENGLAND!! We can still do this,&quot; says Richard Parker, who is also a lunatic. &quot;On another matter, is Sara Torvalds the most unlikely OBO botherer/England supporter ever? Being that she is from Finland and a lady?&quot; Possibly, although we&apos;ve yet to ascertain what species Mac Millings is so it could be him.  WICKET! England 208-7 (Broad c Amla b Kallis 37) It&apos;s over, you don&apos;t need to tell me... Broad has top edged a hook to fine leg, with Amla waiting an age and then calmly taking the catch despite plenty of woooooooooooooooooohs from the crowd. The third umpire wants to check if it was a no-ball on height, but that looks absolutely fine. He&apos;s out! It was a superb bouncer from Kallis, heavy and straight.  68th over: England 208-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 34, Swann 0) Just the 280 Test wickets for Jacques Kallis then. That&apos;s all.  69th over: England 215-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 34, Swann 7) A preposterous shot from Swann, who defends his first ball from Tahir and reverse-slog-sweeps his second for four! Even the coaching manual shed tears at that one.  70th over: England 221-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 35, Swann 11) Swann does well to steer a lifter from Kallis wide of the slips for four, and then Prior is beaten on the inside by a cracker that jags back and just bounces over the off stump. That&apos;s the end of an entertaining afternoon session. For those of you who are clinically insane and think England have a chance, they need 125 from 33 overs in the evening session. Tom Bryant will talk you through that; you can email him at tom.bryant.casual@theguardian.com. Congratulations to South Africa, an outstanding and very likeable team, and thanks for your emails throughout the series. Bye!  TEA  Afternoon everyone: The new ball is due in 10 overs, or 40 minutes or so. That, more than anything, is perhaps why South Africa haven&apos;t shown any nerves at all this afternoon. Philander, Morkel and Steyn have proven time and time again in both this match and the series quite how brilliant they are with the red cherry. In that light, it does seem hard to view anything Swann and Prior might do here as anything other than a heroic, but ultimately doomed last stand. Still, there&apos;s always the 0.000001% of an Englishman who just wonders ...  Re the Finland debate: Here&apos;s Sara Torvalds to clear up any questions: &quot;As to my being the least likely OBOer (67th over), I might well be, but I blame Mike Selvey. A holiday in Goa during an India v Pakistan Test series got me curious about this alien game nobody I knew played or even understood, and his (and Athers&apos;s) cricket writing got me hooked. So there.&quot; Meanwhile, Chris Wareham has this to add: &quot;I&apos;d just like to point out that Finland makes up for its lack of politeness by having more words for drunkenness than any other language.&quot; Each one of those words will be used by any England fan currently in the stands at Lord&apos;s if this doesn&apos;t end in tears. Or if it does, for that matter.  Anyone else got a horrible feeling the difference between the sides will be Philander&apos;s 61?  71st over: England 221-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 35, Swann 11) Tahir resumes and Prior attempts a big old hoicked sweep from out of the rough but misses. He settles down for a couple of balls, then has another go with the same results. He knows he&apos;s got to score from out of the rough, so walks back to leg for the final ball of the over to combat Tahir&apos;s line, but only clip to the fielder at square leg. A maiden.  72nd over: England 231-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 36, Swann 21) Kallis cramps Swann for room with his first two, then drops one short. Swann swivels and clonks him lustily to the boundary. He then does the same to the next ball, walking across his stumps to do so. A couple of singles follow. &quot;Has anyone else experienced plane storage bin rage?&quot; asks Seamus Devlin. &quot;I was going to a bachelor party in Montreal from LaGuardia and I was sitting in front of a guy who had put his bag right in the middle of the small-ish storage bin. To get my bag in, I moved his a bit to the side. He stood up and said &apos;What are you doing?&apos; in his best offended French-Canadian and moved his bag back to where it was. A friend I was traveling with, a large New Yorker, yelled at the top of his voice (the entire cabin looked round) &apos;SIT DOWN FRANCE!&apos; I can only assume that, like De Gaulle, this guy thought that he was in fact the nation as he did sit down.&quot; A lot of these stories seem to involve stag dos, don&apos;t they?  73rd over: England 236-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 40, Swann 21) Prior is trying to play Tahir by backing away and making room. The spinner has, thus, been following him. But he drops one short here and Prior slaps him to the midwicket boundary. His response is to turn a beauty from outside leg right across the stumps. They run a tight bye before Tahir again forgets the rule that, pitching the ball outside leg, somewhat negates the chance of an LBW. His yelp after hitting Swann in front is quite rightly ignored. Meanwhile Rob Smyth has just offered Sean Ingle odds of 100-1 for England to win from here. Ingle, never one to turn down a bet, has promptly slapped two quid down. IT IS ON!  74th over: England 240-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 43, Swann 22) Kallis has stopped dropping the ball short, bowling a proper line and length and stopping the batsmen scoring. He&apos;s keeping time before the new ball. Prior isn&apos;t having it though, and so runs a very good, very tight too - taking on Dale Steyn&apos;s arm, which is a bold thing to do. &quot;I once met some drunken finnish football fans at a Sunderland game who taught me the Finnish for &apos;Cheers&apos; which is &apos;Kippis&apos; but is pronounced Git Pissed which is statement of intent in Scotland,&quot; emails Ged Lerpiniere. Good old Finns. Good old Scots.  75th over: England 255-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 51, Swann 29) Tahir is aiming for those pitch marks again and Swann knows as much. He comes skipping down the wicket and thumps him for a big six into the Compton lower. A quick single takes the runs needed below 100. Prior gets in on the act too, reverse sweeping the spinner to the cover fence for his 50. He does the same two balls later. Smyth&apos;s beginning to sweat about that \u00a3200.  76th over: England 265-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 51, Swann 39) Kallis is still bowling that tight line, no width, no short stuff, no half volleys. Or at least he was ... Swann steps back to a shortish one and simply slams it over the rope for another big six to bring up the 50 partnership. He steps into a sweet cover drive next for four. &quot;The photo on your OBO page of Kallis leaping salmon-like to catch Trott shows the exact spot where I was sitting on Saturday,&quot; emails Rob Wright. &quot;Back then it was a sun-bathed paradise full of happy smiling England fans. Now it looks like bleaker than a Specials album cover.&quot; I was sitting directly above you in the upper tier. Sun bathed is putting a positive spin on it. I&apos;m bright red today. Still.  77th over: England 273-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 58, Swann 40) Tahir&apos;s back and England&apos;s blood is up. They&apos;re running everything, desperately milking this old ball for all they can. They run a quick one to leg slip then decide not to chance Steyn&apos;s arm for two to square leg. Prior slightly mistimes a straight drive and, rather than the four he hoped for, can only get two. No matter, he sweeps again and sweeps hard, sending the spinner to the backward square leg boundary. I&apos;m simply not printing any emails saying &quot;Could they?&quot; Just so you know.  78th over: England 281-7 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 65, Swann 41) Graeme Smith does look worried now. He brings on Morkel, who presumably he had been saving for the new ball. Swann has a mighty heave at his first one and follows it with a grim smile. He settles for running a single to third man before Prior mistimes a slap to the same area and is lucky no-one is underneath it. Next he chips Steyn at mid-on by an inch for a four. Were Morkel still fielding there, he would have been tall enough to take it. A wild slog at one that bounces over middle stump follows. This is nuts. Two overs to the new ball.  &quot;Tell Smyth if he loses I&apos;ll gladly chip in a bob or two,&quot; emails Richard Woods. &quot;This is fun.&quot;  WICKET! England 282-8 (Swann run out [Duminy] 41) Tahir is still coming over the wicket, still whizzing it into the rough. England are still swinging. Swann runs a very tight single to backwards point and the fielder hurls it in. Tahir throws it at the stumps and Swann&apos;s gone by an inch.  79th over: England 283-8 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 67, Anderson 0) Swann stuttered for a second before going, unsure if the run was on. Had he gone straight from the get-go? He might have made it. Can Anderson make up for that dropped catch yesterday? Smyth&apos;s fondling Ingle&apos;s two quid with a little more conviction now.  WICKET! England 283-9 (Prior 67 c Duminy b Morkel) Oh no. WAIT Taufel goes to the third umpire to check for the no ball ... And Morkel has overstepped. Prior is walking back to the middle. NOT OUT Prior chipped one high into the sky and the ball was well taken in the deep by Duminy. He walked off, dismayed, and then sprinted back to the middle. It&apos;s 284-8.  80th over: England 286-8 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 67, Anderson 2) You&apos;ve got to feel for South Africa there. Morkel looks sick. He bowls a tight line at Anderson, who scampers through for a single. Prior can&apos;t nick a single to get down to the other end and take the strike next over. They thought it was all over with that catch. Here comes the new ball. It probably is now...  81st over: England 288-8 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 69, Anderson 2) With Anderson on strike, Smith hasn&apos;t taken the new ball, expecting Tahir to put the ball into the rough outside the left-handed Anderson&apos;s off stump and spin him out. Anderson is polite to his first two, then hoicks a sweep to midwicket for one. Prior comes charging down the wicket, misses and De Villiers takes off the bails. It&apos;s gone upstairs ... NOT OUT But, my word, that was tight. Very, very tight. Prior works away a two then, attempts to get up the other end off the last ball and the entire Lord&apos;s crowd shout &quot;NO!&quot; at the top of the voices. Luckily, he gets back in time.  82nd over: England 293-8 (target: 346 in 103 overs; Prior 73, Anderson 3) Steyn takes the new ball. He begins with a short dose of outright filth down the leg side. Might have been called a wide by an uncharitable umpire. He follows it up with another short one to Anderson&apos;s ribs. He prods it down to point and there&apos;s another tight run. Umpire Dharmasena goes upstairs but Prior was home by a foot. Steyn hurls down another wide one, drifting away - exactly the ball that Prior out in the first innings. Not sure it was intentional though. The next one is: an absolute jaffa - starting off on middle and, with a combination of bounce and swing, ending up way outside off. Unperturbed, Prior cuts classily to the boundary off his next. England need 53.  WICKET! England 294-9 (Prior c Smith b Philander) There&apos;s no denying this one. Nicked to the slips. Philander has already rapped Anderson on the pads, getting the new ball to dart wildly in the air. Prior came forward to a well-pitched up ball and simply feathered to Smith in the slips, who took it in his fingertips. What an innings by Prior.  IT&apos;S ALL OVER! England 294 all out (Finn c Kallis b Philander 0) South Africa win by 51 runs, the series 2-0 and go to No1 in the world. Finn gets a goldie, Philander gets a five-for and has a good shout of the man of the match award. It was nice while it lasted - both the Test and England&apos;s No1 status - but South Africa have played brilliant cricket all series and for all of this test. The better team won, and the better team is the best team in the world.  &quot;The only person to blame here is the person who decided that this should be a three Test series only,&quot; emails Daniel Chisnall. A three Test series to decide the best team in the world. It would have been lovely to see this played out over five, especially after this Test - one of the best in recent years. The South Africans look jubilant, Strauss congratulates them but there&apos;s just something in his manner, just a little hint, that he&apos;s been worn down by this. It would be a great shame if this was his Test in charge, a great shame.  Dropped catches? Yes, dropped catches didn&apos;t help. But arguably this series was lost at The Oval. South Africa came out in utterly dominant mood and didn&apos;t take their foot of England&apos;s throat, not helped by England&apos;s dismal performance. It&apos;s hard to force someone else to choke if they&apos;ve got their foot on your windpipe.  &quot;Does this mean that Philander is now on a hat-trick until the next time he plays England in a Test?&quot; asks Sam Walton. No - hat tricks can carry over two innings but not Tests. Here are the ICC Test standings, incidentally: 1. South Africa 120 2. England 1173. Australia 1164. Pakistan 109 4. India 104  The various suits are on the podium, doling out the gongs. Taufel and Dharmasena both, oddly, get the same commendation for wildly differing games. Philander is quite rightly awarded the man of the match award - though it would have been interesting to see whether Prior would have got it had England pulled this off. Big Vern says: &quot;We always knew that getting two balls in the right area would do it for us&quot; and, boy, did he get two key balls in the right area this evening. &quot;Did you enjoy having those left handers in your sights this series,&quot; asks presenter Atherton. &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; says Big Vern.  Matt Prior is given the prize for England&apos;s player of the series. He looks as though he&apos;s been awarded a big kick in the swingers. He says: &quot;It almost hurts more when you get that close. Not being able to get over the line in the end was very disappointing. Broady played beautifully, Jonny Bairstow started it off for us.&quot; What was he thinking when he was reprieved by Morkel&apos;s no ball? &quot;Maybe it is my day ... but it wasn&apos;t to be. &quot; He adds: &quot;I have to say congratulations to the South Africa team,&quot; before saying &quot;catches win matches and we put those vital catches down ... back to the drawing board.&quot;  Hashim Amla wins the man of the series for South Africa without much competition. Were you starting to get twitchy tonight, asks Athers. &quot;Yes,&quot; he says. &quot;Moments like this make cricket what it is. It&apos;s been a great advert for Test cricket.&quot; Of his triple hundred at Lord&apos;s. &quot;It&apos;s a bit of a blur, it was a while back. I&apos;m very glad I got to start the series well and end it well too ... The wicket [at Lord&apos;s] was good to bat on and small partnerships mattered. We managed to scrap a bit and we&apos;re really chuffed to get over the line.&quot;  Here&apos;s Andrew Strauss: &quot;It was an outstanding Test match, some first class cricket by both teams. I thought the spirit and never say die attitude the guys showed was a great credit to them. South Africa thoroughly deserve their victory ... unfortunately for us South Africa were better than us but full credit to them for being so.&quot; He pays tribute to Swann, Prior and Jonny Bairstow and, asked how he looks back at England&apos;s year at the top of the world rankings, he says he doesn&apos;t look at it &quot;with a great deal of fondness&quot;. &quot;We&apos;ll come back though. When you reach number one you&apos;ve got to up your performance, you can&apos;t rest on your laurels. Although I can&apos;t fault the effort the guys have put in, in certain areas we weren&apos;t on the ball.&quot; Atherton asks: are you the man to take England back to the top of the rankings? &quot;Well, I hope so.&quot;  Here&apos;s Graeme Smith: &quot;It was a top Test match. Both teams played really well and England played with a great deal of freedom. We had to work really hard. It was wonderful to come through, a great feeling.&quot; The no ball, the stumping? &quot;You start having those nervous moments but you&apos;ve got to stay focused. We always knew the new ball gave us an opportunity and Vernon got it perfect.&quot; On the series - what made the difference? &quot;We were able to post totals, build partnerships and get scores on the board. That allowed our bowlers to bowl with freedom and get rewards. We caught well.&quot; There&apos;s a message to his wicket keeper Mark Boucher scribbled on his chest and he takes a minute to say of him: &quot;He&apos;s been an integral part of the Proteas and this series victory is for him.&quot; He also mentions the death of the miners in South Africe: &quot;I know our nation is in mourning and a lot of guys lost their lives. I&apos;d just like to let them know we&apos;re thinking about them too.&quot;  That&apos;s it: a brilliant Test match comes to an end, as does a fascinating series. Both the on pitch performances (and a certain somebody&apos;s off-pitch performances) have been headline-worthy but South Africa have been the better team by far, away from home, and facing a much vaunted Test attack with their most familiar conditions. Well done South Africa, well played England too. See you in India. Well, after the ODIs, the world Twenty20s, and all the nonsense. But this is Test cricket. And boy, what Test cricket it was.", "sentences": ["&quot;Best example of bad seat etiquette was on a train from Schiphol to Amsterdam central station,&quot; says Matthew Valentine."], "title": "England v South Africa - as it happened | Rob Smyth and Tom Bryant", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/20/england-south-africa-live", "tags": ["South Africa in England 2012", "Cricket", "England cricket team", "South Africa cricket team", "Sport", "Over by over reports"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-21T09:58:32Z", "article": "Booker-bashing is often described as a &quot;national sport&quot;. But that should be called into question by this week&apos;s diatribe from Irvine Welsh, in which he called the prize organisers&apos; failure to rebut accusations of anti-Scottishness a sign of &quot;arrogance&quot; and &quot;intellectual enfeeblement&quot;. As usual, in our colonial arrogance, we are forgetting our Scottish cousins! Booker-bashing is, of course, an international sport. You don&apos;t have to be English to do it at all. Although, if one believes Welsh, you probably have to be English to win the thing. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book festival on Sunday, he said: &quot;The Booker prize&apos;s contention to be an inclusive, non-discriminatory award could be demolished by anybody with even a rudimentary grasp of sixth-form sociology.&quot; The award, he said, was &quot;based on the conceit that upper-class Englishness is the cultural yardstick against which all literature must be measured&quot;. I wasn&apos;t at that talk, so am not certain of the full context in which Welsh was speaking, and therefore I should preface what comes next with a word of caution: it&apos;s possible that I&apos;ve misunderstood. Even so, I&apos;ve been wracking my brain to think of a way in which &quot;upper-class Englishness&quot; could be taken as a measure of the Booker prize and I just can&apos;t find one. In fact, it seems to me that it&apos;s actually Irvine Welsh&apos;s contention that can be &quot;demolished by anybody&quot;. You don&apos;t even need a grasp of sociology to do so. All you need is a list of past winners. Let&apos;s start with the first 10 years: PH Newby: Something To Answer For Bernice Rubens: The Elected Member JG Farrell: Troubles VS Naipaul: In a Free State John Berger: G Nadine Gordimer: The Conservationist Stanley Middleton: Holiday Ruth Prawer Jhabvala: Heat And Dust  David Storey: Saville Paul Scott: Staying On Iris Murdoch: The Sea, The Sea  I would love to see anyone trying to tell VS Naipaul that he can only be measured in terms of upper-class Englishness. I&apos;d then love that same person to stagger on to John Berger, the fierce Marxist whose novel G details the struggles of the working man in the 19th century across Europe, and who dedicated half of his prize money to the Black Panthers. It would be equally absurd to contend that the South African Nadine Gordimer, writing about her home country, should somehow be set up against any kind of &quot;Englishness measure&quot;. Ruth Prawer Jhabvala is a Jewish exile from Nazi Germany writing about India. Bernice Rubens was a Welsh woman of Jewish descent writing about Jewish east Londoners. Iris Murdoch was Irish and she wrote, exclusively, about Iris Murdoch. Meanwhile, the English writers in that list are JG Farrell (who was of Irish descent and whose book is fiercely, hilariously critical of English colonialism), PH Newby (also a critic of colonialism, writing about a non upper-class soldier), Paul Scott (another critic of colonialism, and arguably far more interested in India than the English), David Storey (a working class Yorkshireman, writing about working class Yorkshiremen), Stanley Middleton (a middle class Nottinghamshire man writing about a middle-class Nottinghamshire man) and John Berger whom we&apos;ve already discussed and who would almost certainly rather beat upper-class English people with a yardstick than measure himself against them. Carrying on in this manner would quickly become tedious, so I&apos;m going to fast forward. You&apos;ll just have to take it on trust that the next decade, featuring books such as Salman Rushdie&apos;s Midnight&apos;s Children and Keri Hulme&apos;s Bone People has nothing to do with upper-class Englishness either. But I have to pause at 1989, because - halleluljah - The Remains Of The Day is even about an upper-class Englishman, in England! The first in the history of the prize. Although that the fact that this book was written from the perspective of a butler by one Kazuo Ishiguro does once again rather undermine Welsh&apos;s case. The next decade, meanwhile, is just as diverse. Admittedly, in the 1990s, the Booker panel did fail to reward Trainspotting and that was quite possibly a mistake. But any charge of anti-Scottishness is quickly trumped by the fact that the prize was given to James Kelman&apos;s How Late It Was, How Late \u2013 a harder, tougher and more anti-English piece of literature than Welsh has ever written. In that decade it might also be argued that Pat Barker&apos;s lamentable Ghost Road has English concerns (namely educated young men being blown apart in the first world war), the ridiculous ciphers in Ian McEwan&apos;s Amsterdam do straddle the upper echelons of English society and Graham Swift has a fairly posh English voice, even if he was writing about working class south Londoners. Otherwise, a list that contains The Famished Road, Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, and The God of Small Things once again blows Welsh&apos;s contention to smithereens. The story is the same after the turn of the millennium. We have a book by an Australian about 19th-century Australian gangsters, a book by a Canadian writing about an Indian, a book written by an Irish-resident Australian about American high school kids ... Wolf Hall admittedly, in touching upon Henry VIII, probably comes as close as any Booker winner to supporting Welsh&apos;s thesis, but even that mainly focuses upon the working class Thomas Cromwell and it is against him that anyone else in the book must be measured. So where is Welsh getting his information? I don&apos;t have any skill in sociology, so certainly don&apos;t want to suggest that Welsh&apos;s own nationalism is to blame. The idea that a Scottish patriot could have a chip on his shoulder and demonstrate an irrational anti-English bias is patently absurd, after all. More seriously, I wouldn&apos;t want to suggest that the Booker prize is problem-free. Greater efforts should be made to broaden the spectrum of books that win the thing. But even so, suggesting that &quot;upper-class Englishness&quot; has ever been a concern of the judges is patently absurd \u2011 and unfair. Nationalism, after all, is a terrible thing.", "sentences": ["In that decade it might also be argued that Pat Barker&apos;s lamentable Ghost Road has English concerns (namely educated young men being blown apart in the first world war), the ridiculous ciphers in Ian McEwan&apos;s Amsterdam do straddle the upper echelons of English society and Graham Swift has a fairly posh English voice, even if he was writing about working class south Londoners."], "title": "Irvine Welsh's Booker prize attack makes scant sense", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/21/irvine-welsh-booker-prize-sam-jordison", "tags": ["Edinburgh international book festival", "Edinburgh festival", "Festivals", "Books", "Booker prize", "Fiction", "Irvine Welsh", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-22T10:50:39Z", "article": "One fugitive from justice fights for human rights, the other for those of animals. Both have long histories of confronting governments and legions of passionate supporters. And now both have skipped bail in foreign countries to avoid extradition to much more powerful nations which they believe want to try them for political reasons. But the similarities between WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and Paul Watson, charismatic founder of radical marine enforcement organisation Sea Shepherd, end there. Assange is holed up very publicly in the Ecuadorean embassy in London to avoid being sent back to Sweden where he faces questioning on sexual assault charges but fears he will be extradited to the US. Watson has disappeared after skipping bail in Germany in the face of allegations by Costa Rica \u2013 strongly denied by Watson \u2013 that he endangered the lives of some of its shark finners back in 2002. The Canadian-born environmentalist who co-founded Greenpeace and has waged a 40 years&apos; war against illegal fishing and marine destruction faced extradition requests from both Costa Rica and Japan, against whom Sea Shepherd have waged a long and bitter war over whales in the Antarctic. But where is Captain Watson? This week I left messages around the world for him in an attempt to invite him to write a piece for the Guardian. Oliver Wallasch, his lawyer in Germany was not taking calls, nor was the European director of Sea Shepherd. The organisation&apos;s US HQ in California referred me to his legal status on their website, and Watson himself was not answering his US or European phones. Meanwhile, the bridge of the Sea Shepherd flagship, the Steve Irwin, took a call as it steamed off the Western Australian coast but the message was clear: &quot;We have no idea where Captain Watson is.&quot; Only his PR company said they had been in contact with him in the past few weeks, receiving several emails from him. But they, too, said they had no idea where he was. The best bet is that Watson is at sea \u2013 his home. Last year he told me he only spent a few days a year on land, and his lawyer last month said that he felt he [Watson] thought he could be of more use to his clients \u2013 the whales and fish \u2013 on a ship than he could in a German or Japanese prison. But if he is not on the Steve Irwin, could he possibly be on either of Sea Shepherd&apos;s two other boats, the Brigitte Bardot and the Bob Barker? Both are thought to be in Australian waters preparing, like the Steve Irwin, for a new anti-whaling campaign in the Antarctic against the Japanese, starting in December. Neither ship could be contacted but anyway, it seems unlikely he could have left Europe without the authorities noticing. So could he still be in Europe? The Guardian has been told that his daughter and the head of Sea Shepherd&apos;s European office had been seen in Amsterdam. But equally, it was claimed that he may be seeking political asylum in Chile through senator Juan Pablo Letelier, who, it appears, has been asked to &quot;accelerate political asylum for Watson&quot;. Much more likely is that Captain Watson will apply for political asylum, like Assange, in Ecuador, where President Correa has a strong human rights record and where Sea Shepherd has a long history of working with the national police and the Gal\u00e1pagos to catch illegal fishers and apprehend the shark mafia. The organisation was in 2005 even granted the power to arrest people believed to be fishing illegally and in 2007 Sea Shepherd donated their old US coastguard boat to the marine national park. Although Correa once expelled Sea Shepherd&apos;s Ecuadorean representative, Sean O&apos;Hearn, relations were patched up and Watson has been very complimentary about Correa. The last hint that Ecuador may be the preferred destination of Watson is that he is known to be good friends with Mariana Almeida, head of Ecuador&apos;s vibrant Life Without Frontiers ecological foundation. In a letter to a US website, she recently wrote with apparent knowledge of the legal case Watson&apos;s legal team may be expecting to pursue:  &quot;The case of Captain Watson would also be presented to the pertinent human rights commissions and organisations and shall be placed on the agenda of the European parliament, the international agreements shall be respected and it is clear that Germany might need to explain to the European parliament the reason to accept the extradition request from a Caribbean country without an extradition agreement.&quot;  It&apos;s not conclusive, but Watson needs all the friends on land that he has got right now. He has proved many times that he is the master of maritime law but whether he can now outwit an array of governments led by the powerful Japanese, may define the rest of his buccaneering life.", "sentences": ["The Guardian has been told that his daughter and the head of Sea Shepherd&apos;s European office had been seen in Amsterdam."], "title": "Where is Captain Paul Watson? | John Vidal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/aug/22/where-is-captain-paul-watson", "tags": ["Environment", "Environmental activism", "World news", "Protest", "Oceans", "Whaling", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Marine life", "Whales", "Greenpeace", "Cetaceans"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-22T21:30:02Z", "article": "I was once involved with a stunt this newspaper carried out at a Labour party conference in Bournemouth. We press-ganged a bunch of local students and organised an ironic guerrilla Save Tony Blair campaign (he wasn&apos;t at his most popular at the time). We had placards (&quot;Two tiers are better than one&quot;, &quot;Ten More Years of Tony&quot;); we heckled and harassed. It was funny\u00a0\u2026 ish. But it wasn&apos;t nearly as funny as Jolyon Rubinstein and Heydon Prowse are in The Revolution Will Be Televised (BBC3). In character as junior MPs James Twottington-Burbage (Con) and Barnaby Plankton (Lib Dem) they gatecrash the Lib Dem conference in Newcastle, and make total nuisances \u2013 and total twats \u2013 of themselves. James the Tory tries to have a coffee with Vince Cable; then, when the business secretary seems reluctant, James tries to get Vince to bring him a latte (&quot;Cheers, good boy&quot;). He asks a female delegate&apos;s advice on how they might talk down to women and still get their vote, while Barnaby does his best to come out at the LGBT stand. And suddenly our little stunt at Bournemouth looks very tame. But I remember how excruciating, and terrifying it was to do. These Jolyon and Heydon dudes may be a couple of smartarses, but they&apos;ve got cojones of steel and the size of a bull&apos;s. The conference prank isn&apos;t even their ballsiest, or their funniest. I love the embassy one, in which Heydon, dressed as a traffic warden (kinda), goes to the Finnish and German embassies, clamps a couple of diplomatic limos and tries to collect unpaid Congestion charges (\u00a3133,000 and \u00a33.6m respectively). And Jolyon&apos;s Dale Maily character, a fearless reporter dressed in full Kevlar flak jacket, running with the Occupy movement (&quot;the funny thing is that when you&apos;re embedded with the hippies you actually realise they&apos;re human beings&quot;). And the Amsterdam fetishist clubbers who organise a night of torture and humiliation at the M16 building (though to be honest, anything is funny in a comedy Dutch accent). But bravest of all must be Heydon&apos;s attempt to get Tony Blair sainted. This involves him turning up at Tony&apos;s London house, with a stained glass window featuring grinning Saint Tony, and being allowed in, past the armed guard, to try it for size, oh and borrowing a ladder \u2026 That just takes audacity to a whole new level. Auda City. I was squirming, and tied up in knots inside, with tears \u2013 of fear and laughter \u2013 running down my face, along with the involuntary snot. It&apos;s these two \u2013 as their Twottington-Burbage and Plankton characters \u2013 who presented George Osborne with a maths GCSE book at a bankers&apos; dinner, remember? Something to look forward to in a future episode. As usual, with any kind of show like this, it&apos;s the reactions of the prankstees that are as telling as what the pranksters are doing. Some come out of it better than others (it&apos;s a kind of relief when they do). The hippies of the Occupy movement are mostly lovely, and human beings after all, underneath the filth and the smell. The feds behave quite well, in a resigned, almost tolerant kind of way. Even some of the bankers see the funny side of Jolyon and Heydon&apos;s Give Us Back Our Fucking Money You Cunts campaign. And the guy at the Finnish embassy is a very jovial chap. Whereas the high-ranking German diplomat is a total Arschloch. He, and his scary henchmen, are pretty stupid too \u2013 how can they really think that a guy in a Day-Glo bib turning up asking for a cheque for \u00a33.6m is anything but a joke? Underneath the giggles, there are actually some points in here, about hypocrisy, injustice, greed and corruption. Bankers are bankers; the Daily Mail brings its own agenda to a story; the diplomatic congestion charge scandal is just that, an absolute scandal; as is Philip Green avoiding an estimated \u00a3285m in income tax (GUBOFMYC) because his wife lives in bloody Nondomonaco; the coalition is a joke, but not the funny sort; and whoever&apos;s in charge of Tony Blair&apos;s security possibly shouldn&apos;t be. It&apos;s Sacha Baron Cohen with a bit more substance then, or Mark Steel with a few more laughs. Plus a hint of Dom (as opposed to non-Dom) Jolly silliness.

Violins soar and whine, propelled by the whirring tide of rotors beating the air. Flickers of light suggest the shadow of blades. Six dancers take position. We have lift-off. First performed in 1995 in Amsterdam, Helikopter-Streichquartett is the third scene of Stockhausen&apos;s Mittwoch aus Licht, in turn part of his cycle of seven operas. On Wednesday, Birmingham Opera Company ambitiously performed Mittwoch in its entirety for the first time, while this dance interpretation by French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, which premiered in 2001, was staged concurrently in Edinburgh. It feels like we lose nothing in this recorded version. The sound is immense. Three men and three women move with grace and style in the tumult: rotate, rotate, roll, kick, leap. Lay flat. Cool but purposeful, their bodies work at a pace that is uncannily collected. In this product of two artists who loved each other&apos;s work, an uplifting harmony is miraculously achieved. Eldorado, the second half of this programme, brings the collaboration together again. We watch a dozen gods at home. Posing, playing around, they move with marble-cool elegance to a ringing, synthesised score (Sonntags-Abschied), shape-shifting one minute with the precise grammar of chess, the next with the compositional beauty of a renaissance tableau. And yet they seem so human: Preljocaj puts a heartbeat into his abstract interpretations, which only falter a little when a section of jiggles and grinds seems unnecessarily literal. His choreography and company are sexy enough without spelling it out. At the end, as the dancers stand against glowing portals, my friend leans over and says: &quot;Beam me up, Scottie.&quot; Preljocaj&apos;s work might be seriously clever \u2013 and often very moving \u2013 but sometimes it brings a smile to your face.", "sentences": ["First performed in 1995 in Amsterdam, Helikopter-Streichquartett is the third scene of Stockhausen&apos;s Mittwoch aus Licht, in turn part of his cycle of seven operas."], "title": "Ballet Preljocaj: Helikopter/Eldorado (Sonntags Abschied) \u2013 Edinburgh festival review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/23/ballet-preljocaj-edinburgh-festival-review", "tags": ["Ballet", "Dance", "Stage", "Karlheinz Stockhausen", "Music", "Edinburgh festival 2012", "Edinburgh festival", "Festivals", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-24T07:00:00Z", "article": "On 7 December 1972, one of the three astronauts on board the Apollo 17 spacecraft took a photograph. Released by Nasa following the mission&apos;s safe return from the moon, it showed \u2013 for the first time \u2013 the fully illuminated face of the Earth. Set against the cloud-streaked blue of the oceans, the lineaments of Africa, Arabia and Antarctica were all clearly on display. Here, presented at last to the gaze of humanity, was a literally cosmic image of the geography of our planet. Two and a half millennia earlier, an unknown scribe in Iraq had drawn on a clay tablet the very earliest surviving attempt to show the world. Iraq itself \u2013 which on the Nasa photograph could just be made out at the top of the globe \u2013 was placed at the centre of an encircling ring of ocean. Mountains, marshes and the river Euphrates: all were represented. The focus of the map, though, was the great city of Babylon. Portrayed as a massive rectangle bisected by the Euphrates, its position within the ring of the ocean only incidentally reflected its actual position within Iraq. The concern of the cartographer lay ultimately with what he would no doubt have seen as an altogether more authentic dimension of reality. If Babylon was placed at the centre of the map, then that was because the Babylonians \u2013 with the conceit that comes naturally to a swaggering, imperial people \u2013 took for granted that their city served the cosmos as its pivot. Between the Mesopotamian scribe and the American astronaut, then, there stretched an immense ideological as well as technological gulf. Nevertheless, not everything had changed over the course of the millennia. The photograph released by Nasa might not have been oriented around Washington DC, as was the clay tablet around Babylon; but it spoke of a certain level of superpower self-satisfaction, even so. Nor, as it turned out, was the photograph entirely devoid of its own metaphysical dimensions. Plato, in one of his dialogues, had described the sphere of the world as something that a soul, ascending in a moment of supreme transcendence, might behold as fashioned &quot;of colours more numerous and beautiful than any we have seen&quot;. In the space age, with the realisation at last of the dream of extra-terrestrial travel, the image of the planet in all its fragile beauty, set against the infinite blackness of space, prompted in many an almost religious consciousness of the commonality of human experience. Its influence over the succeeding decades \u2013 whether on third-world identity politics or environmentalism \u2013 would prove immense.     The Cantino Planisphere (1502).    Rare, in other words, is a representation of the earth&apos;s geography so accurate and neutral that it brings with it no baggage at all. What is true of a photograph tends to be even more so of one composed by human hand. &quot;A map,&quot; as Jerry Brotton observes in his fascinating and panoramic new history of the cartographer&apos;s art, &quot;always manages the reality it tries to show&quot;. It is the truth of this observation that enables him to trace, in the way that rivers, mountains and seas have been drawn in various cultures and periods, the contours of human self-awareness as well. Peaks and troughs; disinterest and prejudice; pin-point accuracy and whole realms of experience imagined as the haunt of fearsome monsters: civilisation bears witness to them all. Brotton&apos;s methodology, fittingly enough, is that of a compiler of an atlas. Contained within his book are studies of a dozen landmark maps. These range in time from the classical to the contemporary, and in origin from Sicily to Korea. Yet for all that, the sweeping self-assurance of his title \u2013 A\u00a0History of the World in Twelve Maps \u2013 should not be taken wholly at face value. If there is one truth that Brotton&apos;s survey repeatedly emphasises, it is that cartographers cannot help but betray their own centre of gravity. In the middle ages, the Hereford Mappa Mundi portrayed the easternmost reaches of Asia as the haunt of griffins, cannibals, and &quot;the accursed sons of Cain&quot;; meanwhile, in China, scholars took for granted that the far west was &quot;the zone of cultureless savagery&quot;. More recently, a year after the Apollo 17 mission took its celebrated photograph, the German historian Arno Peters unveiled a new map of the world which corrected what he saw as the unforgivably Eurocentric projection of Mercator, and served to increase the size of Africa and South America at the expense of Europe. &quot;The applications of the Peters projection,&quot; as Brotton points out, &quot;throw into stark relief the fact that, ever since Ptolemy, individuals and organisations have appropriated world maps for their own symbolic and political ends, regardless of the cartographer&apos;s claims to comprehensiveness and objectivity.&quot; Even Google Earth, which incorporates so much geographical information that it seems set to consign paper maps to obsolescence, still has a way to go before it can provide standard high-resolution data of the entire planet. As it is, those regions most exhaustively covered tend to be the ones with the highest concentration of computers and credit-cards. So what of Brotton himself? A clue as to the focus of his own mapping is to be found in the title he holds at the University of London: &quot;Professor of Renaissance Studies&quot;. No surprise, then, that the meat of his book should consist of a brilliant survey of cartography in the early modern period, when Europeans began to explore entire continents unsuspected by Ptolemy, and maps bore vivid witness to the geopolitical and commercial upheavals unleashed in their wake.     Martin Waldseem\u00fcller's map of 1507 may have been the first map to name America. Library of Congress, Washington    Whether it was Martin Waldseem\u00fcller drawing what may or may\u00a0not have been the first map to name America, or Diogo Ribeiro recalibrating\u00a0the location of the Moluccas in a\u00a0sneaky attempt to buttress the imperial interests of the Spanish crown, or Joan Blaeu demonstrating that atlases, in the golden age of Amsterdam, could be made to pay financially, the cartographers of the 16th and 17th centuries were fitting standard-bearers for the emerging era of European supremacy. Yet the narrative is not simply the one illustrative of western arrogance and greed articulated by Arno Peters. Mercator&apos;s projection, for instance, far from serving as a monument to the glories of European civilisation, was in fact an expression of the very opposite: a deep despair at the savagery of its hatreds. His map, so Brotton convincingly demonstrates, &quot;was part of a cosmography that aimed to transcend the theological persecution and division of sixteenth-century Europe.&quot; Nor are the subtlety and empathy that underlie this judgment absent when Brotton, venturing beyond his home territory of the Renaissance, comes to explore the cartographical expanses of the middle ages. His study of the delightfully named Book of Roger \u2013 a compilation of Greek, Latin and Arabic geographical knowledge assembled by a Muslim scholar under the aegis of a Christian king \u2013 provides a perspective on the limits of medieval multi-culturalism that is no less hard-headed for Brotton&apos;s sense of wonder that it should have existed at all. Even more striking is his take on the tension between the dimensions of the eternal and the earthly implicit in the Mappa Mundi \u2013 which in its original setting pointed towards the second coming, that moment of cosmic transfiguration when the New Jerusalem will descend from heaven, and all geography promptly becomes redundant. This means, as Brotton wittily points out, that it belongs to &quot;a genre of map unique in the history of cartography that eagerly anticipates and welcomes its own annihilation&quot;. Perhaps fittingly enough, it is only in the period that gave us the phrase &quot;terra incognita&quot; that his mapping of the contours of cartography in the past becomes just a trifle perfunctory. Brotton&apos;s survey of Ptolemy and the reaches of classical geography that he was drawing on is workmanlike, but it lacks the spark and the sense of the unexpected that elsewhere are such features of the book. This \u2013 since Ptolemy is the first of Brotton&apos;s 12 cartographers to be featured \u2013 is doubly\u00a0unfortunate. Readers who find the first chapter dry \u2013 as many may well do \u2013 are strongly urged not to cast the book aside, but to press on, and keep using it as a guide. Brotton&apos;s idea of tracing within maps the patterns of human thought and civilisation is a wonderful one. \u2022 Tom Holland&apos;s In the Shadow of the Sword is published by Little, Brown.", "sentences": ["Library of Congress, Washington    Whether it was Martin Waldseem\u00fcller drawing what may or may\u00a0not have been the first map to name America, or Diogo Ribeiro recalibrating\u00a0the location of the Moluccas in a\u00a0sneaky attempt to buttress the imperial interests of the Spanish crown, or Joan Blaeu demonstrating that atlases, in the golden age of Amsterdam, could be made to pay financially, the cartographers of the 16th and 17th centuries were fitting standard-bearers for the emerging era of European supremacy."], "title": "A History of the World in Twelve\u00a0Maps  by Jerry Brotton \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/history-world-twelve-maps-review", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "History", "Maps"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-24T22:01:00Z", "article": "Press the bright yellow &quot;check prices&quot; button on TripAdvisor at your peril. Suddenly your screen is blasted with hotel booking websites jockeying for your attention, all promising &quot;best price guaranteed&quot; or &quot;we match the price or your first night is free&quot;. But the result of this competitive hubbub? Nearly every site appears to offer the same price and you end up wondering why you should bother trawling through so many pop-ups. But, maybe, it&apos;s not that surprising that the price &quot;choice&quot; offered on TripAdvisor, the world&apos;s biggest hotel review site, can seem so limited. When the competing results flash up from Hotels.com, Expedia.co.uk and Venere.com, they are within a few pence of each other because \u2026 well, the same company owns Hotels.com, Expedia and Venere. So it&apos;s virtually pointless obtaining separate quotes. For example, try booking a Holiday Inn for two nights in Amsterdam this autumn. The TripAdvisor &quot;check prices&quot; button told me it would be \u00a3170.64 at Expedia, \u00a3170.64 at Venere and \u00a3171 at Hotels.com. To be fair, TripAdvisor&apos;s &quot;check prices&quot; button doesn&apos;t take you just to the sites of one reservations company. For instance, it nearly always shows offers by Booking.com, the biggest hotel reservation site and deadly competitor to Expedia. So what did Booking.com offer on the two nights in Amsterdam? Er, \u00a3170.63. Or 1p cheaper. That&apos;s competition for you. There is no suggestion of active collusion between the competing websites to offer near identical prices. That would be illegal. But behind the lookalike prices is a practice that has become standard in the industry \u2013 &quot;rate parity&quot;. The big sites pressurise hotels to offer the same price, letting them advertise as the &quot;cheapest&quot; \u2013 and prevent smaller competitors from undercutting. This week the issue hit the US courts with Expedia, Booking.com plus numerous other sites and big hotel chains (such as Hilton and IHG, owners of Holiday Inn) accused of conspiring to fix prices. Travel sites &quot;created the illusion&quot; consumers could seek out the best deals, Steve Berman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told Reuters. &quot;The reality is that these illegal price-parity agreements mean consumers see nothing but cosmetic differences and the same prices on every site.&quot; The Office of Fair Trading has also accused the sites of infringing competition law, helped by evidence from Skoosh, a small UK online travel agent that has campaigned on the issue. The major booking sites and hotel groups vigorously contest both the US lawsuit and the OFT action, and argue rate parity is not anti-competitve. But if the OFT rules against them, the fines could be potentially up to 10% of their turnover. The lesson? Buying over the internet doesn&apos;t automatically mean you&apos;ll obtain the best price. And from my own \u2013 admittedly limited \u2013 research, always try the hotel&apos;s own website first. I&apos;m off to Croatia (pictured) in September. The hotel I&apos;m considering was quoted at \u00a3464.50 on Booking.com, \u00a3463.05 on Expedia, \u00a3463.00 on Hotels.com, \u00a3463.55 on Venere \u2013 and \u00a3359 on its own site. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 August to correct a sentence that stated that TripAdvisor and Expedia were part of the same company.

Omori followed the cherry blossom across Japan for his almost hallucinatory series Everything Happens for the First Time. Courtesy of Galerie Wouter van Leeuwen    Unseen is backed by Blockbusterfonds, a\u00a0new private fund created to finance large-scale creative events in the Netherlands. It is the brainchild of billionaire philanthropist Joop van den Ende, a phenomenally successful TV and theatre producer and former co-owner of Endemol, the company that famously created the Big Brother format. He argued that the Dutch government, rather than continuing with a programme of severe cuts in cultural funding, should invest in the arts, ensuring that more money would flow back into the economy. Surprisingly, the Dutch prime minister agreed, but pointed out that the government just did not have the cash. Blockbusterfonds is van den Ende&apos;s private venture. As part of the pre-publicity campaign, 900 tickets and 400 vouchers for Unseen have been given away as prizes in the Dutch BankGiro lottery. Each voucher is worth \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3790) and can only be spent on prints at the Unseen Photo Fair. Entering into the spirit of the event, the participating galleries, which include several well-known London names such as the Photographers&apos; Gallery, Michael Hoppen, Flowers and Magnum, have each donated a work to the Unseen collection which will be sold for less than \u20ac1,000.

It is all about making photography more accessible. The lowest price for a print is probably just under \u20ac600, but most will cost much more than that. You can also put the voucher towards a more expensive print.&quot; The highly regarded Marloes Krijnen \u2013 director of Foam, the Amsterdam-based gallery, magazine and website devoted to contemporary photography \u2013 is also a director of Unseen, which in many ways is an extension of the Foam ethos of inspiring interest in the new and upcoming. The project has credibility, then, as well as financial clout. For all that, van\u00a0der Lee admits that some of the galleries they approached were initially not so keen. &quot;It is a new idea that took some explaining,&quot; he says. &quot;What was most important to us was that the galleries took the Unseen concept to heart, even if they interpreted it in their own way. Some, for instance, have chosen to show work by established photographers, but prints that have not been exhibited before.&quot;     Love Letters by Jiang Zhi, \u00a32,500.

Plus, financially it makes sense. I couldn&apos;t really risk taking a lot of new work to Paris Photo, say, because I have to sell photographs that will justify me paying up to \u20ac40,000 for a stand. Here I can show new artists alongside \u2013 and against \u2013 established artists. It&apos;s a great idea all round.&quot; And what would his advice be to first-time buyers or those wishing to start a photography collection? &quot;It&apos;s a bit of a clich\u00e9, but you should really only buy what you like.

After spending the morning listening to other people&apos;s answerphone messages, he followed Corbett out of MI6&apos;s Moscow office. His mouth fell open with shock when he saw Palleson, dressed like a Hampstead queer, casually shoot Corbett through the head. Damn Palleson! He was the devil incarnate. He had to be destroyed before his evil spread any further. Six months later, Max was lying in his Monaco hotel room with the traffic-stoppingly beautiful Gemma, whose auburn hair offset her exquisite calf muscles. &quot;Avez-vous un copy of Le Soleil,&quot; he asked. &quot;You are so sexy when you speak French,&quot; she smiled. &quot;But I have to go and meet someone for lunch.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s OK,&quot; said Max. &quot;I&apos;ve got to see a man about a dog myself.&quot; Back at MI6 HQ in London, Max helped himself to a Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1990 as Tryon, his boss, quizzed him about the Monaco operation. &quot;It may sound incredible,&quot; Max said, &quot;but while Palleson may appear to be one of our top MI6 spies, I have evidence to prove that he is involved in a totally absurd plot to steal 10 of the world&apos;s finest paintings and is one of this country&apos;s largest importers of heroin.&quot; &quot;Good God, man,&quot; Tryon replied. &quot;Thank God you went to Eton.

French Sophie, whose beauty radiated like an aura, had finished forging the Vermeer, and Max had managed to substitute it for the one in the British embassy. Furthermore, the pulsating ache in Max&apos;s groin had been reciprocated by Sophie, and he had the sense the two of them were falling deeply in love. &quot;Just be careful,&quot; he begged her. &quot;Ooh la la,&quot; cried Sophie. &quot;Je suis not tr\u00e8s bonne at being covert as it is vair impersonal.

Very knowledgeable acousticians can tell you all about reverberation times, frequency ranges and the sonic absorption rates of multi-planed surfaces (I may have made that last one up). But for all the science, the way a hall sounds eventually boils down to something much simpler: does it work or doesn&apos;t it? In Britain, there are famously few places that qualify as having great acoustics for an orchestra. The Usher Hall in Edinburgh is one of them, the Royal Albert Hall in London is not. In the Usher Hall, a sort of Albert Hall in miniature, you are slapped in the ears with the immediacy and force of the sound. Even from the back row, the Cleveland Orchestra seem as vivid and as loud as if they were in your front room. But in the gigantic maw of the Royal Albert Hall, the home of the BBC Proms, it feels as if the musicians are playing in the next room \u2013 possibly the next borough. Acoustics are not the same thing as atmosphere. If the live experience were just about the way things sounded, the only places really worth hearing an orchestra would be the Musikverein in Vienna and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. And yet for my money, the best place to experience an orchestral concert in this country, and quite possibly the world, is the Royal Albert\u00a0Hall. Contradictory? Not really: a space is not defined by the science of how it sounds, but by its audience, by their quality of listening and attention. Orchestral musicians might resent the Royal Albert Hall&apos;s sonic limitations, but they all love the audience. The Musikverein is stuffed with expensive hairdos and designer labels, and the Usher Hall observes a sort of decorous respectability.

This week&apos;s Story of British Art is dedicated to it. But what is the baroque? It is a grand, florid style that first appeared in Italy around 1600 when artists and architects burst out of classical rules to create emotive, dynamic images and overwhelming spaces. Caravaggio&apos;s painting The Seven Acts of Mercy is a powerful expression of the baroque. So is Bernini&apos;s awe-inspiring multimedia installation the Cathedra Petri in St Peter&apos;s. This Olympic summer exploded just about every cliche of British national identity. Stiff upper lip? Yeah, right. Severe and puritanical? You&apos;re kidding? The Olympics revealed a nation of extravagant, theatrical fun. You might even say a baroque nation. That talent for spectacle should come as no surprise because Britain took powerfully to the baroque the first time around, in the 17th century. The gore of Jacobean tragedy is totally baroque. Artists including Peter Paul Rubens, Gianlorenzo Bernini and Artemisia Gentilsechi worked for Britain&apos;s baroque monarch, Charles I. Sadly for him, there were plenty of Puritans around too. Early Stuart architectural extravagances like the Queen&apos;s House in Greenwhich and the Banqueting House in Whitehall \u2013 with its ceiling by Rubens \u2013 did not exactly reassure them about the dynasty&apos;s grand self-image. The baroque age in Britain was bloody \u2013 it includes the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Yet art and architecture kept on getting better and better. Van Dyck is the portraitist of Charles I&apos;s court, Peter Lely of Charles II&apos;s. The Great Fire of London was terrifying yet cleared the ground for the architectural masterpieces of Wren and Hawksmoor. This was the age when British world power started to matter. By the end of the 17th century, London was taking over from Amsterdam as the leading entrep\u00f4t of global trade and the British navy was getting ready to rule the waves. Baroque magnificence was the perfect art to express Britannia&apos;s newfound glory. In 1698 Wren designed an enormous domed dining hall for officers of the Royal Navy at Greenwich: the &quot;Painted Hall&quot; was decorated with flamboyant murals by Sir James Thornhill that make it one of the most amazing interiors in Britain. In 1729 Thornhill&apos;s daughter Jane married a young printmaker and painter called William Hogarth. In Hogarth&apos;s art the energy of the baroque is transformed into grotesque comic abundance. This is an age when art and architecture are one, culminating in great mixed-media theatres of power like Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard. In its quest for potent images and its mixing of all media to create an effect, baroque Britain (1600-1730) has a lot in common with the baroque Britain of 2012.", "sentences": ["By the end of the 17th century, London was taking over from Amsterdam as the leading entrep\u00f4t of global trade and the British navy was getting ready to rule the waves."], "title": "The Olympics remind us of Britain's baroque heritage", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/aug/27/olympics-britain-baroque-heritage", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-08-28T11:13:00Z", "article": "This week&apos;s Cine-files is from film-lover Siobhan Morrin. Building The eclectic facade of this 1921 cinema immediately catches the eye on a stroll down the bustling Reguliersbreestraat in Amsterdam. The twin towers and intricate fenestration incorporate a mix of styles: art deco features mingle with art nouveau and Jugendstil styles in a striking, if overwrought entrance. The interior continues to overwhelm the eyes with its dark wooden doors, impressive stained glass lamps, and a lush red carpet befitting of the premieres it hosts. Clientele Of course, the imposing exterior and location on a central shopping street mean that the cinema attracts a lot of tourists; no doubt many of them there purely for a peek at the lobby, though are often enticed further inside to take seat in the Grote Zaal. Premieres are also held here, featuring a slightly higher-profile crowd than your average Wednesday afternoon. Weekly promotions, such as cheaper tickets for over 50s, and child\u2013friendly listings ensure the audience is mixed, and the fairly mainstream cinematic fare on offer brings in a steady stream of locals and dating couples. Programme The Tuschinski tends to show blockbusters with wide appeal, though leaves some of the cheesier options to the other Path\u00e9 cinemas in the city. As well as the bigger premieres, the cinema holds its own events, including festivals of European films and first screenings of choice award winners. The historic function of the venue as a stage for musicians and singers is still palpable in the special screenings of opera or ballet performances, and in the organ that remains in place. There&apos;s also strong representation here from what the chain terms &quot;Path\u00e9 alternative cinema&quot;; these tend to be the less widely shown European films, screened in their original language with Dutch subtitles. As in the rest of the Netherlands, the Tuschinski shows plenty of original version pictures, which is great for the ex-pats and tourists. They also throw in a handful of dubbed titles, usually kids&apos; films. Further comments Making a trip purely to marvel at the building is recommended, and the cheaper daytime tickets for the Grote Zaal are definitely worth the entry fee for a look at the screen&apos;s surrounds. The plethora of other cinemas in the city means it isn&apos;t the only place to see current releases, though its smaller screens offer a feeling of intimacy, even if they aren&apos;t all as architecturally impressive as their larger sibling. One novel aspect of seeing a film at the Tuschinski is the option of going VIP on the balcony in the Grote Zaal. Pay a couple of extra euros on top of the standard ticket price and you can enjoy a cosy two-seater along with a snack and drink for the show. And of course, you get to enjoy the elevated view, which is excellent if you&apos;ve found a film that can get you to peel your eyes off the ceiling. The Twitter view @nickhristou  Beautiful old cinema in Amsterdam, a real european movie palace.   \u200f@discobisc  Beautiful cinema with very elaborate, baroque decor but unfortunately typically shows H&apos;wood blockbusters.   @MediaJake  The greatest cinema I have ever been to; as grand a venue as film deserves reminding you why the experience is so important  @eising  Tuschinski is perfect to see any movie, both mainstream and arthouse.

You\u00a0are doubtless familiar with its two-storey, 5,829 sq ft, three-master-bedroom interior \u2013 the 72in flat-screen television, the walls padded with mohair to absorb sound, something mysteriously described as &quot;privacy controls&quot;, which, under the circumstances, they might want to send someone from maintenance up to have a look at \u2013 but news of what took place in its opulent surroundings during Prince Harry&apos;s recent Naked Romp just keeps on coming. First, let us examine the report \u2013 from our old friend An Anonymous Source on showbiz website Radar Online \u2013 that the spirit of the late Hunter S Thompson was unexpectedly abroad once more in Sin City that fateful evening. Apparently, among the\u00a0prince&apos;s new-found American friends were some people on drugs. Thus far, the papers seem to have concentrated on the angle that &quot;some were doing cocaine&quot;. Lost in Showbiz, however, is far more intrigued by the suggestion that others had ingested psilocybin, or, as AA Source put it, were &quot;rolling on &apos;shrooms&quot;. Lost in Showbiz wonders if it was one of them who was operating the cameraphone that US media claim was filming His Naked Romp, and if the reason footage has yet to surface is that it consists entirely of another &apos;shroom-user delightedly making the suite&apos;s touch-screen-operated curtains open and close for 45 minutes. It also likes the idea that some members of the party may have spent\u00a0the Naked Romp trying to commandeer the stereo in order to turn off Essential R&amp;B 2012 and put on\u00a0Ozric Tentacles&apos; Fetch Me the Pongmaster, suggesting they all stop playing strip billiards and watch The Wizard of Oz with the sound turned down and Dark Side of the Moon playing, or \u2013 as was the case with a similarly fuelled acquaintance of Lost in Showbiz during a stag weekend in Amsterdam \u2013 continually interrupted proceedings by alternately bellowing &quot;I&apos;M CLINGING ON TO SANITY BY MY\u00a0FINGERNAILS&quot; and howling like a\u00a0wolf. Furthermore, Lost in Showbiz is impressed to the point of awe by the notion that there were people present, tripping on powerful psychedelics, at the exact moment the third in line to the British throne decided to show his penis to everybody. It can&apos;t think of circumstances more likely to deliver a\u00a0catastrophic blow to a psyche undergoing an intense hallucinogenic experience. If they are not currently being attended to in a psychiatric unit as a result \u2013 their faces locked into a horrified grimace, their voices mute save for the terrible, bloodcurdling scream they let out whenever they hear Ozric Tentacles&apos; Fetch Me the Pongmaster \u2013 it can only salute their sheer mental fortitude. Here, surely, are what Allen Ginsberg would have called the best minds of our generation: people with brains of purest titanium, capable of withstanding the worst the world can throw at them. But let us move from the event itself to the aftermath. Lost in Showbiz is delighted to note that for every voice carping about royal duty, there are many who not merely support the Naked Romp, but feel it is the key that\u00a0unlocks a glittering future for the\u00a0wayward prince: when life hands\u00a0you lemons, you go to the fully stocked wet\u00a0bar in your two-storey, 5,829 sq ft, three-bedroom suite and make lemonade. It applauds the optimism of\u00a0Las Vegas&apos;s self-styled &quot;Diamonds in the\u00a0Buff&quot;, the Chippendales, who have\u00a0apparently invited Prince Harry\u00a0to\u00a0join them onstage in their custom-designed theatre complex with\u00a0adjacent boutique &quot;hosting a variety of items that appeal to women&quot; (neon vibrating crotchless panties, $19.95). Its applause turns to a\u00a0veritable standing ovation when it thinks of Steven Hirsch, founder and co-chairman of a company called Vivid Entertainment, who swiftly dispatched a letter to Clarence House, offering Harry not merely $10m, but &quot;the opportunity to truly become the coolest prince of all time,\u00a0by starring in a fun, sexy, big-budget adult film called The Trouble with Harry&quot;. &quot;We assure you the sex will be well-scripted,&quot; he added, as if Harry might expect anything other than auteur film-making and high quality mise-en-scene from the company behind Big Tit\u00a0Jack Off, The Anal Intern and the educational Penny Flame&apos;s Expert Guide to Hand Jobs. There are voices who will doubtless suggest that any situation that commences with you taking all your clothes off in a room full of people on drugs and ends with an offer to make a celebrity porno must, by default, involve some loss of dignity. Lost in Showbiz prefers to view said situation as an unexpected platform on which the protagonist&apos;s manifold qualities can come to light. For proof, let us finally turn to Sharon Osbourne, who used a discussion on American television to inform viewers that Harry was in possession of a rare wit, which she encountered during a\u00a0visit to Buckingham Palace: &quot;I said to\u00a0him, would you watch my bag while\u00a0I go to the loo. And he said: &apos;Fuck off.&apos; How fabulous. What a fabulous answer in jest.&quot; What a week: hallucinogenic drugs,\u00a0porn, neon vibrating crotchless panties, the kind of repartee unheard since The Vicious Circle drifted apart. Exhausted, but wide-eyed with wonder, Lost in Showbiz plaintively asks: where will it all end?

With that in mind, Alan Pardew was cheered by Newcastle United&apos;s luck of the draw. With no journey more onerous than a hop to Portugal on their Group D schedule against Club Brugge, Bordeaux and Maritimo, Pardew is relaxed. &quot;My gut reaction is that the travelling is good, so I&apos;m pleased about that,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&apos;t really want to go to Ukraine or Russia or anywhere. The teams are of the standard you would expect in Europe so it&apos;s a toughish group. Not the toughest by any means, but a test for us.&quot; Liverpool have landed a long-distance trip, and it is a fascinating one. They meet one of the most intriguing names in the modern game, Anzhi Makhachkala, the Dagestan-based project backed by the billionaire Suleyman Kerimov. The Russian League team are currently managed by Guus Hiddink, and boast a few familiar faces including Samuel Eto&apos;o, once the scourge of the Champions League with Barcelona, the former Chelsea wing-back Yuri Zhirkov and the former Blackburn Rovers defender Christopher Samba. They also have in their squad a young Brazilian who should surely one day play for the team from across Stanley Park, a defender called Ewerton. For Anzhi, a match against the five-time European Cup winners is an extraordinary stepping stone. They have played only one previous match in European competition proper, a Uefa Cup tie against Rangers in 2001. Due to the political instability in neighbouring Chechnya, the match was played at a neutral venue, in Warsaw. Rangers, then the relatively wealthy favourites in such a contest, won 1-0. Anzhi now play their European matches in Moscow, which makes the logistics considerably less complicated for Liverpool. Their other assignments in Group A are with Udinese \u2013 who were so heartbroken to miss out in a Champions League play-off for the second successive season that their coach, Francesco Guidolin, went home to mull over whether he was up to the job \u2013 and Young Boys from Switzerland. Tottenham Hotspur also face Italian opposition, beginning with a match against Lazio which promises some nostalgia. Lazio&apos;s general manager, Maurizio Manzini, who has been in the role since Paul Gascoigne arrived from Spurs in 1992, is moved by the prospect of a first meeting between the clubs. &quot;Tottenham is a team Lazio knows very well, a great team with great traditions and we are very familiar with White Hart Lane starting from the time we had Paul Gascoigne,&quot; he enthuses. &quot;He is a mythical figure for Lazio fans and very popular in general in Italy. There is always a corner of Tottenham in our hearts.&quot; The Roman club will invite Gascoigne to the match at the Stadio Olimpico. The Greeks Panathinaikos and Maribor, from Slovenia, complete Group J. It may take a while before we discover quite how interested managers such as Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas and Brendan Rodgers really are in the Europa League. With a tournament that requires 15 matches and thousands of air miles, the sensible thing is to use squad players and hope for the best until a route to the final becomes a distinct possibility. For these two managers in particular, who are intent on shaping new teams at their new clubs, it is hard to imagine the Europa League being much more than a pleasant diversion for now.

Well, take it from someone who lives here \u2013 it&apos;s not. I am not saying the shows are completely inaccurate; I like the series, and they surely did something right to become one of the longest-running American soaps of all time. Yet despite the reputation for thick accents, over-the-top fashion and cattle barons, there is an arty side, bohemian even, that rarely gets covered. Here is my list of off-the-beaten path attractions, plus some of the unmissable and historic sites, that make Dallas such a fun city to visit. Neighbourhood watch     The Nasher Sculpture Center and Billy Bob's country music club in Fort Worth. Nasher photograph: Alamy    Deep Ellum, east of downtown, is a hotbed for art, music, and graffiti, and one of the more historic areas of the city: it played a big part in the development of American blues music. It has gone through periods of boom and bust but is on an upswing now, with new bars and the recently opened Deep Ellum Brewing Company (2823 St Louis Street, deepellumbrewing.com), with public tours on Thursdays and Saturdays. Classic spots include The Meridian Room (3611 Parry Avenue, themeridianroom.com) and Amsterdam (831 Exposition Avenue, theamsterdambar.com), and legendary music venues include Trees (2709 Elm Street, treesdallas.com) where Nirvana, Soul Asylum, and other grunge bands played in the early 1990s; Club Dada (2720 Elm Street, dadadallas.com), and for metal music heads Reno&apos;s Chop Shop (210 N Crowdus Street, renoschopshop.com). See DeepEllumTexas.com, and DeepEllumSocial.com for more ideas. Further west, Oak Cliff (gooakcliff.org) and the Bishop Arts District (bishopartsdistrict.weebly.com) at Davis Street corridor, and the Tyler Davis Art District (tyler-davis.org) are full of good food, culture, and cyclists wearing nerdy glasses and hats. Over the years this historic area has been the home of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Erykah Badu, Edie Brickell, Dennis Rodman, and T-Bone Walker. Oak Cliff\u00a0 gets slapped around a lot in the media \u2013 it was the home of Bonnie and Clyde, and Lee Harvey Oswald \u2013 but it has undergone a renaissance lately. Lockhart Smokehouse (400 West Davis, lockhartsmokehouse.com) does the best barbecue in Dallas in my opinion \u2013 order from the counter and eat with your fingers. Bolsa (614 West Davis, +1 214 367 9367, bolsadallas.com) does great modern American; and Eno&apos;s (407 North Bishop Avenue, enospizza.com), a pizza place and tavern, is also worth checking out. There are some cool vintage clothing and antique shops, such as Zola&apos;s Everyday Vintage (414 North Bishop Avenue, zolasvintage.com) and DFW M&apos;Antiques (424 West Davis Street), an antique store geared towards men that offers free beer. Lakewood (lakewoodguide.net) next to White Rock Lake, has a relaxed vibe that leaves you wondering if it&apos;s a suburb of Austin. You might also call it Dallas for People Who Hate the Big City. It has drawn hippies, hipsters, artists and families, creating a sense of community. A few favourite haunts include the Cock and Bull (1920 Abrams Parkway, cockandbulldallas.com) a pub that also serves the best burger in Dallas; Cosmo&apos;s Lounge (1212 Skillman Street, cosmosbar.com) a 1960s-style martini bar with excellent pizza; Arcade Bar (1825 Abrams Parkway), and the Lakewood Landing (5818 Liveoak, +1 214 823 2410, lakewood-landing.com). It&apos;s also home to the historic Lakewood Theater (lakewoodtheater.com), which opened in\u00a01938, and features occasional burlesque shows and gigs. The Dallas Museum of Art (dm-art.org), the Nasher Sculpture garden (nashersculpturecenter.org) and the Crow Collection of Asian Art (crowcollection.com) stand together downtown in the Arts District (thedallasartsdistrict.org). Both the DMA and the Nasher have late-night events once a month or so, with bands, movies, and food trucks. Fun things to do     Dallas's M-Line trolley     The M-Line (mata.org) is a system of four (mostly) air-conditioned and heated vintage trolley buses running 365 days a year around Dallas&apos;s vibrant Uptown neighbourhood. All rides are free, though there is a donations box. The Dallas skyline is well worth admiring. The bar of my favourite hotel, the Belmont (belmontdallas.com, stylish rooms from $99), patios at Bryan Street Tavern (bryanstreettavern.com) and The Cedars Social (thecedarssocial.com) are some of the locations affording great views. A scene in the second episode of Dallas was filmed here, with John Ross Ewing and Christopher Ewing. Or take a free elevator ride to the roof of the old Sears Roebuck building (southsideonlamar.com) which is now loft housing. It has the most amazing view: as you stand below it, the rooftop sign feels a bit like the Hollywood hill sign.\u00a0 The cast of Dallas actually stayed here for some portion of the filming of the series.  But the best panorama of the city is from Reunion Tower (+1 214 741 5560, reuniontower.com). The Big Ball on its top is synonymous with the Dallas skyline. Catch a happy hour or eat in the restaurant Five Sixty by Wolfgang Puck (+1 214 741 5560, wolfgangpuck.com), named for the number of feet it sits above ground. Since 1989, the Sixth Floor Museum (jfk.org) at Dealey Plaza has welcomed more than six million visitors seeking information about the assassination of President Kennedy on 22 November 1963 in the plaza outside. The 50th anniversary of the shooting is coming up and the conspiracy theorists are foaming at the mouth. I&apos;ve heard that the X on the street that marks the spot where Kennedy was shot moves every year. How&apos;s that for a conspiracy? Adults can relive their childhood playing two-foot-high Jenga and 1980s video games at Barcadia (1917 North Henderson Avenue, barcadiabars.com). It has several nostalgic video games as well as early-20th-century arcade game skeeball, all for 50 cents a game.\u00a0 Lots of people come to Dallas expecting to see cowboys and are disappointed. But the cowboy is alive and well in Fort Worth (part of the Dallas &quot;metroplex&quot;), and nowhere more so than at the Fort Worth Stockyards (140 East Exchange Avenue, fortworthstockyards.org), a working Old West ranch which is touristy but fun. Go on a Friday or Saturday night to see the rodeo or catch a show at Billy Bob&apos;s, the country music club that bills itself as the world&apos;s largest honky tonk. Nearby at Sundance Square in downtown are hip restaurants and rooftop cocktail bars. If you&apos;d rather hear some real Texas blues, head for The Goat (7248 Gaston Avenue, thegoatdallas.com) and Brooklyn&apos;s (1701 South Lamar Street, brooklynjazzcafe.com) which have blues bands or open mic opportunities nearly every night. Where to eat Unless you&apos;re vegetarian, you can&apos;t visit Dallas without chowing down on some barbecue. Off the Bone (1734 South Lamar Street, +1 214 565 9551, offthebonebarbeque.com) is best for ribs. Hispanic culture is huge in Texas \u2013 but Texans like to put our own spin on the classics, which is why we call it Tex-Mex. My two favourite Tex-Mex establishments are Desperados (4818 Greenville Avenue, desperadosrestaurant.com), a family-owned joint with great fajitas, and Pepe&apos;s &amp; Mito&apos;s in Deep Ellum (2911 Elm Street, pepesandmitos.com), which does chipotle wine sauce enchiladas I have had dreams about. Dallas is also big on street tacos, except they are not on the street. Fuel City (fuelcity-tacos.com), Rusty Taco (therustytaco.com), and Good 2 Go Taco (good2gotaco.com) are three of the best for inexpensive fajita, shrimp, and picadillo (ground beef with spices) tacos. All these places, especially Good 2 Go Taco, offer vegetarian and healthy options that are just as yummy. If meat is not your thing, try the healthy fare at the Dallas Farmers Market (1010 South Pearl Expressway, dallasfarmersmarket.org), a downtown fixture for six decades and now one of the largest public markets of its type in the country. Often you can make a meal out of all the free samples. \u2022 Netflights (netflights.com) has a seven-night trip to Dallas from \u00a3670pp, including room-only accommodation and Delta Airlines flights from Heathrow on 21 October. British Airways (0844 209 2770, ba.com) flies daily to Dallas Fort Worth from Heathrow from about \u00a3725 return including taxes.

He was 89. As a crooner, comedian and variety performer, he often appeared at the London Palladium and became one of the first entertainers to gain a mass audience through regular appearances on television. His long career brought him riches but also attracted critics who ridiculed his distinctive style as dated. Johnny Mans, his agent, said: &quot;We have lost one of the best entertainers that Britain has ever produced. He was a friend to everyone \u2013 there were no airs and graces.&quot; He had been suffering from Alzheimer&apos;s disease and had been cared for by his daughter Christine in Queensland since the death of his wife, Blossom, in May last year. The couple emigrated from Bournemouth to Australia in 2005. &quot;He had become quite confused and often wasn&apos;t sure where he was. He was in good health otherwise,&quot; said Mans. His son Anthony Bygraves, 61, who had visited his father a fortnight ago, said that, while he was frail, he had hoped to see his 90th birthday. &quot;It wasn&apos;t to be. He just slipped away. Although his death isn&apos;t unexpected, it has still come as a shock. We are all terribly sad. Until last year he could still sing along with his old CDs. He knew all the words and even which track was coming up next.&quot; He last appeared in public in the UK in 2006 with revival shows in London and Blackpool. But by then his old-fashioned demeanour attracted as much mockery as it did praise. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck paid tribute to his friend: &quot;He was one of the greats. I have nothing but lovely memories of him. He was a big, big influence on me. He had the audience in the palm of his hand quicker than any other comedian I have seen. They loved him and you don&apos;t get that love very often. He could be very cheeky \u2013 he was a rascal. &quot;He would stroll on and just wow them. He was one of the all-time greats \u2013 a king of the Palladium. He would have them roaring with laughter, singing along and with a tear in their eye.&quot; Comedian Les Dennis tweeted: &quot;So sad to hear that Max Bygraves has died. A great performer and a gentleman. Very gracious when I took over Family Fortunes. RIP.&quot; Ed Stewart, the radio presenter, who was a close friend, said: &quot;He as a person never dated. He was a unique talent, and everything he sang and everything he did, just about, made money for him and the family. &quot;There were one or two others at the time but Max was the doyen of them all. This likeable lad was on everybody&apos;s radio sets in the days of the BBC when you only had the live programmes.&quot; Born in London in 1922 to an East End boxer and given the name Walter, he was one of nine children in a Roman Catholic family. He gained Max as a nickname from his impersonation of the comedian Max Miller on the first night of service after joining the RAF during the second world war. Having won a school talent competition at 13, he first appeared in public as a chorister singing Handel&apos;s Largo from the opera Xerxes, in Westminster Cathedral. His career began in earnest just after the war, when he appeared on stage with Frankie Howerd, Benny Hill, Harry Secombe and Spike Milligan. But it was radio that first saw him bring the music hall tradition to a wider audience when he appeared in, and wrote, Educating Archie with his friend Eric Sykes. A show with Judy Garland at the London Palladium led to a five-month stint on Broadway. His fame grew and soon he was inviting audiences to &quot;SingalongaMax&quot;, which they did through 30 gold discs and 20 royal variety shows. He appeared in the films A Cry from the Streets (1958) and Spare the Rod (1961).

On a modest street in a rundown area, Aziz Kara, a 64-year-old Turk, became embroiled in a ferocious argument with his neighbours. When he was struck to the ground, the impact of the blow put him into a coma. Ten days later Kara died of a brain haemorrhage. In normal circumstances, the death would have preoccupied only the local media. But as the Netherlands prepares for its second national election in two years, Kara&apos;s case was different. When relatives and the local community organised a silent march through the streets of Almelo, politicians and mourners came from The Hague and across the country. National newspaper columns were devoted to the incident, which quickly became a PR disaster for arguably the most influential far-right politician in the European Union, Geert Wilders. To Wilders&apos;s acute discomfort, the man who allegedly beat Kara to the ground was called Henk. And his wife \u2013 who apparently shouted racist abuse at the victim on the ground \u2013 was called Ingrid. The resonance of the names was lost on no one. In the last two years, the Netherlands has learned to live with another &quot;Henk and Ingrid&quot; \u2013 a fictional couple born of Wilders&apos;s own populist imagination. Just as Basildon man and Worcester woman became stars of elections in Britain, Wilders&apos;s blue-collar caricatures were successfully deployed to voice the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam sentiments of his Freedom party (PVV). &quot;Henk and Ingrid are sick of paying for Ali and Fatima,&quot; went one anti-immigrant slogan. After Kara&apos;s death that didn&apos;t sound so good. &quot;Henk and Ingrid are real,&quot; tweeted one TV personality. &quot;And they just killed someone in Almelo.&quot; Wilders has since dropped all reference to Henk and Ingrid. But the backlash against the PVV after the killing indicated that its culture war with Islam is no longer making the political weather in Holland. Wilders, the divisive, charismatic showman of national politics, is projected to take only 18 of the 150 available parliamentary seats on 12\u00a0September, well down from 24 two years ago. &quot;Those Wilders cultural themes are not dominating the public debate,&quot; said Chris Aalberts, a cultural historian at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. &quot;The big election issues right now are economic \u2013 health, social security \u2026 and Europe&quot;. It is a change that could have huge consequences for the eurozone&apos;s political landscape at a delicate moment. For control of the Oranje zeitgeist has not returned to the handful of mainstream national parties which traditionally form coalitions in the Hague. Instead, as austerity bites hard even in this prosperous northern bastion of the eurozone, the newest political insurgency to sweep the Netherlands is coming from the radical left. The Dutch Socialist party (SP) is an organisation once known for its Maoist sympathies and habit of throwing tomatoes at political opponents. It now finds itself within touching distance of becoming the biggest parliamentary force, eclipsing its more moderate rivals in the Labour party and on course to gain at least 30 parliamentary seats. Just as the unexpected success of the leftwing Syriza party in beleaguered Greece set alarm bells ringing in Brussels, the SP has become another surprise package of European politics at a time when more centrist politicians seem to lack ideas. While Wilders&apos;s party made its name through divisive ideas such as a tax on Muslim headscarves, a favourite SP slogan reads: &quot;There&apos;s enough to go round for everyone.&quot; But that inclusive message is intended to carry menacing implications for bankers, business and the EU powerbrokers of Brussels. Anti-austerity and exasperated by endless eurozone bailouts, the SP&apos;s leader, Emile Roemer, 50, has pledged to abandon the government&apos;s plan to bring the budget deficit below 3% by 2013, largely through healthcare cuts and wage freezes, and face down German chancellor Angela Merkel and the European commission if they object. Conservative plans to extend the retirement age from 65 to 67 would also be torn up. And in an echo of French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&apos;s intention to raise more money from the very rich, income tax would be raised from 52% to 65% on those earning above \u00a3119,000 a year. A public investment programme, partly financed by the proceeds, would be aimed at turning around the ailing Dutch economy. For an avuncular former teacher, known for a toothy smile and sometimes nicknamed &quot;Fozzie Bear&quot;, it adds up to an uncompromising platform designed to cause palpitations in both the Amsterdam stock exchange and European commission corridors. On Europe, Roemer has still more to say. A eurozone banking union has been ruled out, as has the so-called European stability mechanism (ESM), which would allow fines to be imposed on countries refusing to maintain balanced budgets. There would be no more Dutch agreement to bailouts of Greece, or any other country. For a once-marginal party that used to stay out of parliamentary politics, this twin strategy \u2013 targeting cuts at home and bailouts abroad \u2013 has struck a deafening chord. The Netherlands no longer feels like a safe haven in the eurozone storm. In May, the European commission predicted that the economy would contract by nearly 1% this year. House prices are falling at an alarming rate and in July the rating agency Moody&apos;s publically contemplated a downgrade of the country&apos;s cherished triple A rating on government debt. Many voters have had enough. In one poll, some 70% expressed a preference for greater economic stimulus and fewer cuts in 2013. Another survey found that only 58% of Dutch people were now in favour of EU membership, compared with 76% in 2010, a drop that represents a major wobble in one of the founder members of the EU. Over a few months, the mild-mannered Roemer has transformed the political debate. Prime minister Mark Rutte has taken to warning that an SP-led government would imperil the country. &quot;The SP has the economic themes,&quot; said Aalberts. &quot;And the foreigners Dutch people are concerned with at the moment are Polish and Greek, not Muslim.&quot; There was ample evidence of that at the Wesselerbrink market in Enschede, where the SP was doing a thriving trade in symbolic foam &quot;protest&quot; tomatoes, handed out to passersby in one of the city&apos;s poorer areas. In this eastern city, which boasts a proud industrial heritage but has a highly uncertain future, the talk among the shoppers was of medical charges, money worries and the malign influence of Brussels bureaucrats and profligate Greeks. &quot;I worked until I was 43,&quot; said Kim Bozuwa, who needs a &quot;scootmobile&quot; to get around. &quot;Then I smashed my kneecap in a fall. I&apos;ve also got diabetes. If the Conservatives win, I&apos;m going to have to pay far more in payments for my medical care. Why? It&apos;s not as if I can choose whether to have the medication or not.&quot; Lillian, a pensioner who has lived in Enschede most of her life, was also contemplating a vote for the SP. &quot;I&apos;ve already got a reduced pension thanks to the crisis,&quot; she said. &quot;I can&apos;t see why we should take orders from Brussels to cut our living standards. Half of the bureaucrats there do nothing that&apos;s any use to anyone and half are on the make. It&apos;s an elite mafia. And the Greeks lied to enter the eurozone. They altered their figures to make sure they got in.&quot; Wim Kooiker, a market regular, echoed her sentiments and went a step further. &quot;The Netherlands should get out of the EU. First it was Greece that needs the bailouts, then Spain, soon it will be Italy and then it will be France. We should get out and so should England!&quot; This month promises to be tumultuous for the eurozone. On the same day that the Dutch vote, a German constitutional court will rule on the legality of a formal rescue fund for euro members, amid mounting fears of a Greek exit. An anti-austerity uprising in the Netherlands would add to the sense that Europe&apos;s policymaking elite has lost its way. Could it happen? With no experience in national government, Roemer struggled in the opening televised debates. It is possible that even if the SP scores a resounding success at the polls, centrist parties will combine to ensure it is excluded from any coalition. But the message of the Dutch election campaign of 2012 is unmistakable. In yet another eurozone country, a huge disconnection has emerged between popular sentiment among voters and the policy consensus maintained by a beleaguered political elite. In Greece, Syriza and its leader, Alexis Tsipras, drew the benefit. In Italy, a maverick comic named Beppe Grillo has become the most popular political figure around. In Holland, a temptation to ditch austerity and go it alone is changing a political landscape dominated for 10 years by multiculturalism and race. As the owner of an engineering company in Enschede, Uulke Visser makes for an unusual SP activist. Unsurprisingly, he admits to a sense of excitement as an extraordinary campaign comes to a climax. &quot;This party stands for the opposite of &apos;what&apos;s in it for me?&apos;. It&apos;s about investing in people and their prospects. Here in the Netherlands we have a group of people who are getting desperate. They&apos;re asking, &apos;Is this all we can expect?&apos;. And they&apos;re thinking things will only get worse. It could yet be the biggest moment in the history of the Socialist party.&quot;", "sentences": ["For an avuncular former teacher, known for a toothy smile and sometimes nicknamed &quot;Fozzie Bear&quot;, it adds up to an uncompromising platform designed to cause palpitations in both the Amsterdam stock exchange and European commission corridors."], "title": "Dutch embrace radical left as European dream sours", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/02/netherlands-elections-socialist-party", "tags": ["Netherlands", "Eurozone crisis", "Geert Wilders", "Europe", "World news", "European Union", "European monetary union", "Euro", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-03T11:51:22Z", "article": "After devoting the first of their two proms to Mendelssohn, the main work in Riccardo Chailly and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra&apos;s exceptional second programme was Mahler&apos;s Sixth Symphony. It shared the programme with Messiaen&apos;s Et Exspecto Resurrectionem Mortuorum, presented with fabulous clarity and measured, ritual weight by Chailly and his wind and percussion players. Chailly&apos;s credentials as one of the greatest of all Mahler conductors were firmly established during his 16 years in charge of the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. In Leipzig, it seems, his readings have become more objective, less expansive than before; the first movement had a tragic intensity that never wavered, the Andante was always kept on the move, while the scherzo had an earthy robustness, fuelled by the gutty string sound and wonderfully characterful wind. Most remarkable of all was the sheer coherence and inevitability he brought to the finale, which seemed conceived in a single, all-embracing span, ending what was one of the most remarkable Mahler performances I&apos;ve heard. Like the first, this Leipzig concert had been preceded by an afternoon organ recital given by Cameron Carpenter. Bach may nominally have dominated the programme, but Carpenter himself was the real centre of attention. At the best of times, hearing Bach played on the huge Albert Hall organ seems as incongruous as a modern symphony orchestra tackling a Brandenburg Concerto. But when it is turned in a vehicle for flashy display, as the Fantasia and Fugue in G minor was, or the prelude from the first Cello Suite finds itself the starting point for a Wurlitzer-like pedals-only fantasy by Carpenter, and the famous solo violin D minor chaconne gets combined with the finale of Mahler&apos;s Fifth Symphony in a huge &quot;syncretic prelude and fugue&quot;, the results are just grotesque. \u2022 Available on iPlayer until Sunday.

Others prompt Mexican waves of booty-shaking across borders. Thus, Ghana&apos;s Azonto, in which the dancers mime everyday activities, has taken over dancefloors across Africa, Europe and the US. Azonto originated among the Ga people of Ghana. Like their Apaa (&quot;work&quot;) jig, revellers wash, drive or dial phones to the tune of a hip-shaking beat, a jived-up version of charades. &quot;Even old people love it,&quot; said Julie Quaye, a 53-year-old housekeeper. &quot;It&apos;s the expressive nature of it \u2013 you can do anything creative with it.&quot; Unabashed, she showed off the latest moves learned from her teenage son, one of thousands who throng to monthly &quot;dance-off&quot; competitions in Ghana&apos;s clubs and beaches. It is of course not the first dance craze to ripple through west Africa. In Ivory Coast the bird flu dance \u2013 intended to provide comic relief as the virus hit west Africa \u2013 rapidly spread to neighbouring Togo and Benin, while the bobaraba (&quot;big bottom&quot;) prompted a rush for &quot;bottom enhancers&quot; from dodgy market sellers. But Azonto is one of the few to make the leap north to western capitals, featuring on the clubbing scene from Amsterdam to Paris. Since entering the UK mainstream this year, the foot-twisting bug has been adopted by Prince William and Piccadilly Circus performers, and even invaded school PE classes. Some see its roots in the snake-hipped performances of Congo&apos;s Kanda Bongo Man, but fishing communities such as Jamestown, overlooking the sea in Ghana&apos;s capital of Accra, are indisputably its spiritual home. From behind pastel-coloured walls and traditional palace murals, the catchy music spills into the streets and is lapped up by passersby. On Sundays, some churchgoers practice an adapted version \u2013 Chrizonto \u2013 while enthusiasts can be spied in music-filled funeral processions winding their way down Jamestown&apos;s hilly roads. &quot;It&apos;s a good way to honour the dead, isn&apos;t it?&quot; said Richard Aryee, a coffin-bearer on a recent Saturday, breaking into step beneath the casket balanced on his head. International footballer Asamoah Gyan celebrates goals with it, making the dance as much a national rallying point as Ghana&apos;s Black Stars team. It has even gone academic; the University of Ghana plans to look into &quot;harnessing Azonto for Ghana&apos;s socio-cultural and economic development&quot;, and has recruited Azonto&apos;s biggest champion, Sarkodie, who describes himself as a &quot;rapaholic&quot;. &quot;Even the name is crazy,&quot; said Accra resident Ramsey Taiwo, who teaches Azonto boxercise with his twin brother, Shady, in between starring in music videos. Enthusiasts wanting to learn have come from as far afield as Germany, they said. Earlier this year, Kwaku Ageyman, a London-based fitness trainer, was watching music videos with friends who had come back from holidays in Ghana. &quot;Azonto was everywhere. I was thinking how about putting some of the moves together in a fitness class for some of the African ladies that wouldn&apos;t normally go to the gym,&quot; the 25-year-old Londoner said. The popularity of the class spiralled. Ageyman found himself teaching moves such as &quot;scratch your back&quot; and &quot;hustling&quot; in school PE lessons and hen night classes. The dance&apos;s popularity has soared in Europe with the arrival of chart-busting Afrobeats hits, a term spanning west African dancehall to hip-hop. Nigerian Afrobeats frontman D&apos;Banj was so impressed by one enthusiast&apos;s YouTube videos \u2013 whose White Boy Azonto! racked up over a million hits \u2013 that he recruited him to perform an Azonto jig in his music video Oliver Twist, itself another popular Nigerian dance. Closer to home, where Afrobeats staples have long lent themselves to a dizzying plethora of dance fads, Azonto faces stiffer competition. In Ghana, the Amanda, nicknamed &quot;African Salsa&quot;, is threatening to knock Azonto off its perch. However, the craze clearly has wide appeal as it can even be found in Nigeria \u2013 although the country&apos;s long-running cultural rivalry with Ghana means it is embraced only grudgingly there. On Lagos&apos;s Alpha beach, to the blare of music from a mobile phone plugged into speakers, Jibril Tenney energetically demonstrated current popular Nigerian dances. Azonto didn&apos;t feature. &quot;[Nigerians] have already had the Yahozee, something like our own Azonto, so it&apos;s nothing special for us,&quot; he said. That didn&apos;t stop him from leaping into a backward shuffle, startling nearby idlers, when a popular Azonto track began playing from the speakers. &quot;Is it from Ghana? We play all the Azonto tracks by Nigerians,&quot; said Alex Kpelle, the owner of the chic rooftop De Marquee club in nightlife-loving Lagos. Later, as the packed room erupted over Nigerian wunderkind WizKid&apos;s Azonto Freestyle. he added: &quot;It&apos;s like a magic word; look around, nobody can sit down.&quot;", "sentences": ["But Azonto is one of the few to make the leap north to western capitals, featuring on the clubbing scene from Amsterdam to Paris."], "title": "Ghana's Azonto craze takes over dancefloors across the world", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/03/ghana-azonto-dance-craze-world", "tags": ["Ghana", "Africa", "World news", "Nigeria", "Dance music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-04T09:46:03Z", "article": "Gone are the days when living off baked beans and porridge was an adequate student budgeting strategy; in tougher economic times and with tuition fees sky-rocketing, many of those off to university this autumn are having to think creatively about how to make ends meet. That&apos;s where the internet comes in. Meet Jack, who studies history at Sussex University. After a year in halls, he left it to his friends to pick a flat for them all to share in second year. At the last minute he discovered it was unfurnished, so Jack signed up to Streetbank, a free-to-use website that enables people to lend or give away items to any members living within one mile of their home. &quot;I heard about Streetbank through a neighbour who uses it to lend out her garden equipment. She&apos;s had all manner of thank-yous in return, including homemade sloe gin. That&apos;s what appealed \u2013 Streetbank encourages sharing rather than swapping, so people take the initiative to show thanks however they wish. &quot;I was given a bed, sofas and board games, and borrowed a drill and a ladder. In return, I cleaned someone&apos;s car and just said a grateful thank you to the person moving house, as she definitely didn&apos;t want anything more added to her packing!&quot; Only two years old, Streetbank already has 15,000 members. As it grows, it&apos;s becoming a hub for those wanting to foster community spirit. Co-founder Sam Stephens says: &quot;I&apos;m constantly impressed by the generosity of Streetbank members. One student wanted to use the site to bring his college community closer together, offering to make mix CDs for fellow students and meeting the recipients when he dropped them off at lectures. Now people all over his neighbourhood are requesting mixes. &quot;He doesn&apos;t overtly save money, but the financial and social benefits of sharing in your community should never be underestimated.&quot; Crossroads, a charity based in Camden, north London, runs a Homeshare scheme, placing young adult lodgers in the homes of older citizens, creating affordable housing in return for companionship and a few hours domestic help a week. The homeowner pays a small fee to Crossroads \u2013 a fraction of the cost of a regular carer \u2013 in a scheme that helps close the social divide between generations while tackling the urban housing crisis. For those not looking to stay somewhere long-term, CouchSurfing links up travellers with people offering a free place to sleep, whether it&apos;s a floor for the night or several weeks in a comfy bed. Likewise, accommodation marketplace AirBnB helps travellers find rooms to rent in people&apos;s homes, often at much cheaper rates than hotels. In both cases, what may begin as a money-saving exercise can lead to unexpected benefits, including invaluable (and penny-saving) local knowledge and, of course, new friends. Peer-to-peer recommendation systems add a layer of security to the experience, plus it&apos;s free to list your space on AirBnB \u2013 so if you have a room to spare you can have a go at being host. Travelling aside, there are two essentials that every student needs: books and food. Read It Swap It is an easy-to-use book-exchange website with over 350,000 books currently available. One man&apos;s trash is another&apos;s treasure and one student&apos;s unwanted Shakespeare collection is another&apos;s core reading list (and \u00a350 saved in the process thank you kindly). Book-swappers have the added benefit of a popular forum, and a rating system that helps prevent bad book-swap behaviour. On to food (carefully avoiding the baked beans). In the UK, we throw away 7.2 million tonnes of food and drink from our homes a year, more than half of which is perfectly edible \u2013 there&apos;s an obvious saving there to begin with. Food waste campaign groups such as Feeding the 5000 point out that you can avoid paying more by choosing where and when you buy food. Author and campaigner Tristram Stuart says: &quot;You don&apos;t need to be a bin-diver to get your hands on food that might otherwise have gone to waste. Going to markets towards the end of the day can yield whole crates of super-ripe produce going very cheap or even free. &quot;Strap a couple of boxes to the back of your bike with an old inner tube, get your bulk purchase home, and cook up a batch of aubergine dip, carrot puree, fennel soup or whatever it is you&apos;ve found. Freeze or preserve what you won&apos;t use immediately and you&apos;ve sorted several lunches for just a few pounds.&quot; In Amsterdam, the Over Datum Eetclub (Expiry Date Dinner Club) organises weekly dinner parties made from delicious, perfectly edible food that&apos;s been rescued from landfill, having gone just over its expiry date. Back in the UK, Abundance helps people become urban harvesters to tap into fruit trees laden with delicious free food at this time of year. So there you have it, just a few of the myriad ways that students can save money.

Here&apos;s a roundup of what you have been reading over the last fortnight. pabloelbrujo:  I am currently reading Philip K Dick&apos;s Ubik - which I am really enjoying. Previous to that I read his The Man in the High Castle which I think is the best book I have read for a long, long time.May I recommend Sadegh Hedayat&apos;s The Blind Owl - which is one of my favourite books of all time and I rarely meet people who have heard of it.  Pecksie:  I&apos;m reading Madeleine de Scudery&apos;s seventeenth-century bestseller, Clelie (sorry about the lack of accents, but this website doesn&apos;t seem to allow them). The original novel, published over the course of six years in 1654-1660, ran to 7300 pages (!), reduced in this edition to a more manageable 385.As it was considered rather unseemly for a woman to seek publication, Madeleine&apos;s brother Georges allowed her to borrow his name, under which Clelie was first published. It immediately became a sensation.  WorcesterStorey:  I was amazed to see that nobody had written a review of Karen Thompson Walker&apos;s The Age of Miracles, which I&apos;ve just finished, so here&apos;s mine:http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780857207234/the-age-of-miracles?commentpage=last#end-of-comments  richardpierce:  I&apos;ve just finished Titus Awakes by Maeve Gilmore, based on a fragment by Mervyn Peake. I loved all the Gormeghast books, and I found this to be a worthy 4th in the series. Its voice was somewhat lighter, I must admit, and it contained much hope beneath the apparent hopelessness of the human condition. Definitely worth a read.  And I join GetOver99 in congratulating R042 on completing his/her novel:  None as of yet, I&apos;ve been writing more articles and working on ideas that never seem to get finished; I did, some time back, finally getting around to putting a novel in a similarly cynical tone out into the wild for better or worse. If you click on my username there&apos;s a link to my blog there.I apologise to all others here for what is really shameless self-promotion.

In short, impatience has become the new 21st century virtue and influences all aspects of business, particularly when it comes to technology. When we switch on our computers, we expect the web page or the video we want to be served up immediately. The arrival of fibre optic network links delivered just that \u2013 access to the worldwide web at the speed of light. This opened the door to cloud computing and, with it, high expectations of accessing cloud platforms from any location in an instant. However, fibre&apos;s ability to deliver at the &quot;speed of light&quot; doesn&apos;t automatically equate to all applications being delivered in this manner. It&apos;s the makeup of the cloud that makes it fast \u2013 its location, type and technology dictate whether those pulling down information from the cloud find themselves in the slow or fast lane. So how can organisations guarantee lightening speed access to their cloud-based, business-critical information? Location, location, location Achieving the holy grail of an instant cloud starts with understanding what dictates its speed. The very ability to use the internet as a personal television started with fibre; it is fibre that was capable of transporting 50 times as much data as previous technology by using light rather than electrical waves. Even though data whizzes along at the speed of light, the download speeds between London and Amsterdam and London and New York will always be different. The elephant in the room is latency. From the very first click on a web page, a &quot;three-way handshake&quot; (there, back, there again) ensures two computers are correctly synchronised to exchange data reliably. And, when a file is downloaded, the receiver acknowledges each block of data as it is received safely, allowing the sender to continue. This symmetrical behaviour values shorter distances over longer distances \u2013 simply because the less time computers are sat waiting for acknowledgements, the more time they spend moving data. This is why a 6,000-mile return trip on today&apos;s fastest submarine cables from London to New York takes 70 milliseconds, whereas a much shorter journey to Amsterdam and back, takes just eight milliseconds. To put this into context, a person in London pulling information from a cloud hosted in New York might struggle to attain downloads speeds of 10-15Mbps, whereas the same download request sent to a data centre in Amsterdam could probably hit 40-50Mbps. Yes, it&apos;s all about location \u2013 and it&apos;s not just the proximity that makes a location special. Logic dictates that when transporting data from one side of the world to the other, the most direct route is the fastest. Consequently, a dispersed jigsaw of the most powerful internet hubs was born \u2013 London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and New York. It&apos;s these internet hubs that fire up data; they act as powerful exchanges pushing traffic to its destination. And, it means that cities such as Dublin, that sit right at the end of the line where information terminates, would never be in a position to qualify as a super internet hub. The network is the computer The power of cloud computing isn&apos;t just ignited by powerful internet hubs and its proximity to them. The &quot;magic&quot; of the cloud really comes alive if built inside the network. And it is the dedication of this asset as the cloud computing backbone that will influence whether the experience of accessing it is an instant one. Imagine if the shortest and most direct route on the motorway was reserved for just one organisation. The employees in that organisation could use it whenever they wanted, and it wouldn&apos;t matter if thousands of other people decided to travel at the same time. It is creating this &quot;fast lane&quot; for a cloud that will make it special. The act of creating individual super-highways is where the magic happens. By pairing dedicated networks with technologies such as MPLS, traffic to and from a cloud can be secured to allow for private cloud security with public cloud convenience. In simple terms, a cloud supported by an expansive intelligent network, underpinned by location savvy internet hubs will enable organisations to cheat the speed of light.

If Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scores one more goal for his country, he can equal the number of Oranje goals attained by Johan Cruyff. And let&apos;s face it, the Dutch national team could really use a good news story these days. It has not been a period in their history that will be remembered fondly. The horror show of the European Championship, which served up a trio of painful performances that left Edwin van der Sar, for one, &quot;in shock&quot;, was clearly a rock bottom moment. From that point, it was depressing to start the new chapter, under Louis van Gaal, with a 4-2 defeat to Belgium in August&apos;s friendly. That the team were not able to bounce back knocked a little more stuffing out of them. All in all, expectations heading into a round of World Cup qualifiers are cooler than they would normally be. There has certainly been enough food for thought to keep a glutton busy for a while. Under the circumstances, Van Gaal is a reasonable choice to try to push the Dutch back on track, starting with a rendezvous with Turkey at the Amsterdam ArenA on Friday, followed by a trip to Hungary on September 11. Although the 61-year-old had an uninspired spell in charge just over a decade ago, which culminated in the failure to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, there was no other obvious place to turn once Bert van Marwijk slunk away. Guus Hiddink, Frank Rijkaard, Dick Advocaat and Marco van Basten have all had a turn over the past few years. Van Gaal brings a record of having produced winning teams at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, so there is no reason to assume he cannot break what is currently a losing habit. &quot;We at the Oranje are really working for a new start,&quot; said Urby Emanuelson. There were few objections to Van Gaal&apos;s appointment. He has far more natural authority than his predecessor \u2013 if he fixes you with one of his hardest stares he has the capacity to make you wish the floor would open up and eat you up \u2013 and that toughness, that bristly side to his character, is bound to have an effect on the team. He may well ruffle some feathers. Already Van Gaal has proved he is not afraid to make big decisions, irrespective of the status of the players concerned. Some important personalities have been excluded from this squad (Rafael van der Vaart, Nigel de Jong, Ibrahim Afellay and Gregory van der Wiel), but with the caveat that Van Gaal does not think they are prepared enough to take part this time. &quot;They have not played much and are busy with transfers. You have to be fit in order to perform well and these guys have not played enough. The door is still open for them, though,&quot; he explained. So far, so reasonable, even if it is brave to leave aside four key members of the squad. Unsurprisingly, not everybody took it well. &quot;I am fully match fit and really wanted to be part of the team for the match against Turkey. It&apos;s very disappointing,&quot; mused Van der Vaart. But the most important choice Van Gaal has made so far has been to back Huntelaar as his preferred striker ahead of Robin van Persie. Arguably he was a little premature and would have got away with hedging his bets for a while, but that is not his style. Before the start of the season, favouring Huntelaar was perceived as entirely reasonable. Van Persie has struggled to excel for the national team. But the choice seems a less straightforward one now that Van Persie is showing off his wares at Manchester United and looking every inch the man in form. If Van Gaal can find a solution that keeps both Van Persie and Huntelaar firing for the national team \u2013 and without any evidence of any sour faces \u2013 it will go a long way to convincing people that the Dutch can rebuild. Van Gaal will introduce some new blood, and \u2013 it is hoped \u2013 some fresh optimism.", "sentences": ["Under the circumstances, Van Gaal is a reasonable choice to try to push the Dutch back on track, starting with a rendezvous with Turkey at the Amsterdam ArenA on Friday, followed by a trip to Hungary on September 11."], "title": "Holland's World Cup opener against Turkey offers a new beginning  | Amy Lawrence", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/sep/06/holland-world-cup-new-beginning", "tags": ["Holland", "World Cup 2014 qualifiers", "Football", "Sport", "Turkey"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-06T21:57:00Z", "article": "A little corner of Leyton will be forever orange. Eton Manor, the genteel Olympic Park outpost where wheelchair tennis has been played during the Paralympics, has been conquered by the Netherlands. Rows of orange-clad supporters light up the stands and it is virtually impossible to watch a match that does not feature at least one of the Dutch masters of this balletic sport. Women from the Netherlands are guaranteed to win all colours of medal in both the singles and doubles competition after an orangewash in the semi-finals on Thursday. And one Dutchwoman in particular has dominated wheelchair tennis in a way unmatched by any athlete, non-disabled or otherwise, in any sport anywhere in the world, apart from Jahangir Khan, the Pakistani squash legend. Khan won 555 consecutive matches in the 1980s but Esther Vergeer is closing in on him fast: the 31-year-old is on a run of 469 successive singles victories and a 470th on Friday will give her the singles gold medal at a fourth consecutive Paralympic Games. The most surprising thing about wheelchair tennis must be that it was invented not in Amsterdam but in California in the late 1970s. For novice spectators the second surprise is that it is the most graceful of wheelchair sports. Unlike the noisy crunching of battered metal chariots in wheelchair rugby and basketball, players here pirouette and spin silently, creating a ballet on wheels. Their hi-tech, five-wheeled chairs are minimally elegant and so is the stroke play, with no double-handed lunges. Instead there are lots of lofted balls, lobs and clever recoveries. Permitting the ball to bounce twice is the biggest difference from ordinary tennis and it creates some thrilling rallies. But players seldom resort to this luxury, retreating and spinning to anticipate opponent&apos;s strokes before attacking the ball as quickly as they can. The one tiny blemish on Vergeer&apos;s astonishing array of achievements (42 grand slam titles, 162 international singles and 134 international doubles titles and counting) is the fact that she could win only a scruffy old silver medal in the doubles in Beijing after doubles golds in Athens and Sydney. Vergeer set out on Thursday to atone for this aberration. &quot;I don&apos;t know if the silver in Beijing has anything to do with it but I just do love winning gold. I really do. That&apos;s the best colour,&quot; she said after she and Marjolein Buis romped to an apparently effortless 6-0, 6-1 victory over Sakhorn Khanthasit and Ratana Techamaneewat, wily Thai veterans with a combined age of 93 (94 with Techamaneewat&apos;s 54th birthday on Friday) who repeatedly lofted the ball high in the air in a futile attempt to slow down the powerful Dutch. The margin of victory was familiar for Vergeer, who once enjoyed a two-year run of 250 consecutive set victories. Like all great athletes Vergeer, who has posed naked in her wheelchair for ESPN The Magazine, makes her game look easy. Such a confident sportswoman may not think in terms of rivals but there is a fascinating subplot in the women&apos;s doubles, in which Lucy Shuker and Jordanne Whiley, the only remaining British players in the competition, lost the second semi-final to another Dutch pair, Jiske Griffioen and Aniek van Koot. Vergeer&apos;s partner in Beijing, the only Paralympic final in which she has played and not won gold, was Griffioen, who won the women&apos;s singles bronze on Thursday after being defeated in the semi-finals by Vergeer. This year, however, Griffioen chose to play with Van Koot, Vergeer&apos;s opponent in the Paralympic singles final, leaving Vergeer with 24-year-old Buis. Vergeer&apos;s new pairing won their first two competitions \u2013 and both times they beat Griffioen and Van Koot in the final, before Griffioen and Van Koot struck back to win their next two meetings at the British Open and in the semi-finals at Wimbledon. Griffioen and Van Koot beat Shuker and Whiley in the doubles final at Wimbledon this year but for a while orange was overshadowed by scarlet as Whiley, a 20-year-old from Halesowen with dyed red hair who is as hyperactive on court as she is on Twitter, led a determined challenge to Dutch dominance. Partnered with the experienced Shuker, Whiley has brittle bones and began playing the sport aged two, following in the footsteps of her father, Keith, who won a Paralympic bronze medal in the 100m in 1984. Despite going 3-1 up in the first set, the British pair could not match the consistency of the Dutch and eventually lost 6-4, 6-3 in the evening sunshine. With Dutch women now facing each other in the singles and doubles finals, is this an intimately brutal sort of rivalry? &quot;Yes, of course there is rivalry but we are also good colleagues,&quot; said Vergeer. &quot;We&apos;re team-mates, we&apos;re sometimes good friends.&quot; In a game of pirouettes the players&apos; rapid spins to save points could be called Cruyff turns given the influence of the legendary Dutch footballer on the sport. Johan Cruyff&apos;s charity supports wheelchair tennis but perhaps the Dutch will not thank him for one intervention while playing golf: he persuaded the disabled golfer St\u00e9phane Houdet to take up the sport. Houdet, a burly Frenchman with a hint of Eric Cantona in his bearing, beat Maikel Scheffers, the third-seeded Dutch player, in one of the men&apos;s singles semi-finals. The 41-year-old, a useful junior tennis player as a non-disabled teenager, is typical of several Paralympians in viewing the motorcycle accident that caused his disability \u2013 an amputation of his left leg eight years ago \u2013 in unequivocally positive terms. &quot;I always wanted to be a great tennis player and that gave me the chance to do so,&quot; he has said. &quot;I guess I would consider the day of my accident the most beautiful day of my life.&quot; Houdet initially struggled to learn how to dance round the court in his chair. &quot;It was terrible. The first days I had so many problems with my hands. I couldn&apos;t even move the chair, I couldn&apos;t reach the ball,&quot; he said after the victory. Nevertheless he persisted and, using the gloves from his games of golf with Cruyff, began to win matches. Houdet and Japan&apos;s defending Paralympic champion, Shingo Kunieda, who beat Ronald Vink, the Dutch fourth seed, in the second semi-final, dashed Dutch hopes of an orangewash in the men&apos;s competition. But the Dutch dominance is still remarkable. What is the secret of their success? &quot;Orange blood \u2013 no one else has it,&quot; reckoned one cheery Netherlands fan at Eton Manor.&quot;I can&apos;t tell you the secret,&quot; said Scheffers. &quot;We train a lot together, we try to help each other and we try to help the juniors, and that&apos;s what makes us so strong.&quot; Vergeer, too, is a massive inspiration. Her great strength, according to Scheffers, a good friend who regularly trains with her, is &quot;her fighting spirit. She wants to improve every day. It&apos;s something extra and that&apos;s what makes her so good. She stays hungry.&quot; How can Vergeer stay hungry after so many victories? &quot;There&apos;s always something that I can improve and if I work on those aspects I see improvement every day and that keeps me motivated. I just love finding the limits. The fire inside me just flows. I love tennis, I love the game.&quot;", "sentences": ["The most surprising thing about wheelchair tennis must be that it was invented not in Amsterdam but in California in the late 1970s."], "title": "Paralympics 2012: Esther Vergeer leads Dutch rule of wheelchair tennis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/sep/06/esther-vergeer-netherlands-wheelchair-tennis", "tags": ["Paralympics 2012: tennis", "Paralympics 2012", "Tennis", "Sport", "Paralympics", "Disability sport", "Olympic Games"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-07T07:30:01Z", "article": "New managers making their bow As is typical of any fresh competitive cycle, this weekend&apos;s round of 2014 World Cup qualifiers has a host of managers taking charge of their first meaningful international matches, including Didier Deschamps with France, Igor Stimac with Croatia and, of particular intrigue, Fabio Capello with Russia. Also worth keeping an eye on is Louis van Gaal, who is in charge of Holland (they face Turkey in Amsterdam on Friday) 10 years after he left the national team post. David Villa&apos;s comeback Injury is most cruel to the player it affects, but it can also be damaging for the spectator, depriving them as it does of the joy of seeing a talented performer in action. This has certainly been the case where Villa is concerned. He was sidelined for eight months \u2013 a spell that took in Euro 2012 \u2013 after breaking his leg playing for Barcelona at last December&apos;s Club World Cup. But Villa, Spain&apos;s all-time leading scorer with 51 goals in 82 games, is back and poised to feature for Vicente Del Bosque&apos;s side in their friendly with Saudi Arabia on Friday and World Cup qualifier against Georgia four days later. Germany getting going again It remains the major surprise of Euro 2012 that Germany, a side that appeared to have perfectly combined robustness in defence with ruthlessness in attack, lost their semi-final against Italy. From the outside it appeared Joachim L\u00f6w&apos;s men froze, and many neutrals were left disappointed at being denied the chance to see Germany face Spain in what had the potential to be a mouth-watering final. Thankfully, L\u00f6w&apos;s side are back in competitive action \u2013 they face the Faroe Islands on Friday \u2013 and, with players such as Borussia Dortmund&apos;s exciting young midfielder Marco Reus expected to start the game in Hanover, we could be in store for more of the same exhilarating stuff. Cristiano Ronaldo&apos;s return to happy mode The question dominating European football discussion this past week has been: &quot;What&apos;s eating Cristiano?&quot; The man who has it all claimed to be sad following Real Madrid&apos;s recent win against Granada and stated people inside the club know why. Cue much rolling of eyes and the belief that Ronaldo is not happy earning only \u00a310m a year at the Bernab\u00e9u, something he has flatly denied. Whatever the case, Ronaldo should be in a better mood when he leads Portugal out against Luxembourg on Friday. He may even smile when he scores. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard trying to play together Yes, this again. We are on to manager No4 and Roy Hodgson, just like Sven-Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren and Fabio Capello, feels he can get the two midfielders functioning together. Past experiences, in a period where Lampard and Gerrard have racked up 187 caps between them and included more disappointments than any England fan can bear to remember, suggest this is impossible, but being the arch-pragmatist Hodgson is expected to give it a go for the match in Moldova. Most likely, they will play in a three-man midfield alongside Michael Carrick. Belgium proving their brilliance Thibaut Courtois, Vincent Kompany, Thomas Vermaelen, Steven Defour, Axel Witsel, Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Eden Hazard, Marouane Fellaini \u2026 how could a team containing players as talented as these fail to qualify for Euro 2012? Technically, it was because they finished third in a group containing Germany and Turkey, but the volatile nature of a squad full of growing egos lay at the heart of Belgium&apos;s fundamental failings. The new manager, Marc &quot;War Pig&quot; Wilmots, is determined to prevent that resurfacing as Belgium set out to qualify for Brazil. All going well, they should sparkle in Group A, which begins with a trip to Wales on Friday. Wales showing what they have to offer The match in Cardiff also provides the hosts with an opportunity to shine. Wales have lost both of their friendlies under Chris Coleman, against Mexico and Bosnia-Herzegovina, but this remains a talented squad, one that was on an upward curve under the guidance of the late Gary Speed. Any team that can call upon Joe Allen, Aaron Ramsey, Gareth Bale and Craig Bellamy should provide an attacking threat and they will be looking to prove that against Belgium before the match away to Serbia four days later. South American showdowns The seventh and eight rounds of Conmebol qualifying also take place this weekend and, as ever, there are some intriguing contests on offer. Copa Am\u00e9rica champions Uruguay, who lie second in the nine-team qualifying group, face Colombia in Barranquilla, while third-placed Argentina take on Paraguay in C\u00f3rdoba. Victory for Uruguay would mean they replaced Chile at the top of the table (Chile face Colombia themselves on Tuesday), while anything else would allow Argentina to rise to the summit providing they win themselves. James McCarthy&apos;s Irish audition Does the inclusion of James McCarthy, albeit somewhat forced by the unavailability of Keith Andrews, suggest Giovanni Trapattoni genuinely intends to adjust an approach that has led to bad performances and a negative atmosphere in and around the Republic of Ireland squad? Probably not, but it will be fascinating to see if the Wigan player can do enough for the team against Kazakhstan to change this most stubborn of minds. All Whites attempt to erase their blushes New Zealand fans often boast that their team were the only unbeaten side at the 2010 World Cup. They are not so voluble about the All Whites&apos; performance at this summer&apos;s Oceania Nations Cup \u2026 where they were humiliated in the semi-final by New Caledonia. On Friday, the countries meet again in a World Cup qualifier and New Zealand, who welcome back Ryan Nelsen and Winston Reid, are desperate for redemption. &quot;The emotion that came out of the Nations Cup is something that&apos;ll be around for a long time,&quot; admitted the New Zealand manager Ricki Herbert. &quot;It would be disappointing if people didn&apos;t have a strong feeling about it and want to put it right.&quot;", "sentences": ["Also worth keeping an eye on is Louis van Gaal, who is in charge of Holland (they face Turkey in Amsterdam on Friday) 10 years after he left the national team post."], "title": "World Cup qualifiers: 10 things we're looking forward to this weekend | Sachin Nakrani and Paul Doyle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/sep/07/world-cup-qualifying-10-things", "tags": ["World Cup 2014 qualifiers", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-07T11:11:34Z", "article": "Prominent figures from the film world, including Jeremy Irons, Charlotte Rampling, Danny Boyle and Kevin Spacey, have urged the Syrian government to release a film-maker detained in Damascus two weeks ago. Orwa Nyrabia, director of the Damascus-based international documentary festival DoxBox, travelled to the Syrian capital on 23 August to catch a flight to Cairo. His family lost contact with him shortly after he arrived at the airport, and Egyptian authorities say he did not board the plane, indicating that he had been arrested by the Syrian authorities. A letter signed by 51 directors, producers, writers and actors says no information has been forthcoming about where Nyrabia is being held, which security branch is holding him or why he has been detained. &quot;We, the undersigned members of the UK film community and international friends, implore the Syrian authorities to release Orwa Nyrabia immediately,&quot; reads the letter, which also counts David Puttnam, Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and Colin Firth among its signatories. &quot;Orwa is a highly respected producer and festival promoter in Damascus who has been pivotal in starting a documentary renaissance in the Arab world,&quot; it says. Copies of the letter have been passed to the UK foreign secretary, William Hague, and distributed in France and the US. Rosalind Ereira, who has known Nyrabia for seven years and organised the letter, said: &quot;We are very worried about his wellbeing.&quot; She described Nyrabia as &quot;incredibly kind, passionate about film, very funny in a very dry way&quot;. In 2002, Nyrabia and his wife, Diana el-Jeiroudi, started Proaction Film, the only independent documentary film outfit operating in Syria, focusing mainly on films tackling human rights, gender and social justice. In July at the Sarajevo film festival they were presented with the Katrin Cartlidge Foundation scholarship, recognising &quot;independence, singularity and integrity of spirit&quot;. Nyrabia has been a member of the jury at film festivals including Tehran, Amsterdam, Leipzig and Copenhagen. He and his wife founded DoxBox in 2008, but last year they cancelled the festival to protest against the violence in Syria, according to the Sarajevo film festival website. Activists say more than 20,000 people have been killed in a crackdown on opponents of the president, Bashar al-Assad. On 15 March this year, the first anniversary of the Syrian uprising, the couple held a Global Day for Syria, screening Syrian documentaries in 38 cities around the world. Last week organisers of the Toronto international film festival expressed concern about Nyrabia&apos;s fate. &quot;We are extremely concerned by his arrest. Film-makers must be allowed to express themselves without fear of reprisal,&quot; they said. Thousands of people have gone missing since the start of the uprising against the Assad regime, according to activists. On International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances last month, Amnesty International said that the Syrian authorities&apos; &quot;heavy-handed response to the popular uprising, characterised by an utter disregard for human rights, has led to a dramatic rise in cases of enforced disappearance&quot;.", "sentences": ["Nyrabia has been a member of the jury at film festivals including Tehran, Amsterdam, Leipzig and Copenhagen."], "title": "Film stars urge Syria to free detained festival director Orwa Nyrabia", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/film-stars-syria-orwa-nyrabia", "tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Film", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-07T11:54:00Z", "article": "Work programme and WRAG The government has drawn up plans to withdraw \u00a371 a week from sick and disabled benefit claimants if they fail to take steps to get back into the workplace.

In 30 years disability rights work, I have never felt so on the margins, despised or threatened, and still it gets worse.  fivemack says:  I would be entirely happy with this if benefits were raised for everyone else by the amount of the fine - that is, pay everyone \u00a399 a week and an explicitly-labelled extra \u00a371 to those compliant with WRAG, so the fine would be a removal of discretionary spending money. It&apos;s not as if the present benefits level is picked to be generous - I don&apos;t think anyone would argue that it&apos;s anything more than the least possible to avoid total destitution - so taking fines out of it breaks the Magna Carta requirement of &apos;no fine shall be levied on him to his utter ruin&apos;. You can&apos;t ethically apply financial sanctions to people whose only income brings them to a bare level of sustenance; this is a recipe for making criminals of the strong and corpses of the weak. If you wish to punish benefit claimants, I think you have to explicitly reinstate the workhouse: provide secure accommodation and provide the work there. Doing this in a way that doesn&apos;t violate every human rights code in the book is a lot more expensive than paying them benefit, so there&apos;d be no temptation to do it for financial reasons.  bendyleopard writes:  Obviously due to being on ESA in the first place, many people have fluctuating illnesses or conditions. Who will be deciding what constitutes a &quot;good enough&quot; reason? The DWP advisor? With no medical knowledge? So someone has a flare up, an injury or whatever and they&apos;re going to get their money docked leaving them with not even enough to pay a weeks gas and buy food? Then they&apos;ll become more ill. Well done. Every single whim this government comes up with will cost more in the long run, save a few pennies in the short term to spend pounds in the longer term. Once this goes through, plus the open ended workfare for ESA, plus PIP being implemented the NHS is going to see the number of sick and disabled people needing extra treatment and support shoot up. And what if struggling makes a permanent worsening in someone&apos;s condition? They may end up in the support group, or requiring more care which will mean higher PIP payments.  Louscalou adds:  I dread to think about the reprecussions for people with mental health issues being forced into work (paid or unpaid). I was placed in the WRAG after being diagnosed with bi-polar, and although my condition has improved with treatment &amp; lots of assistance from mental health teams, and I have been able to undertake voluntary work, I am all too aware that gaining stability is a gradual process which can be fragile. With cuts to mental health services, who will pick up the shattered pieces?  Save the Children fundraising The international aid charity Save the Children \u2013 best known for its work with starving youngsters in Africa \u2013 has launched its first domestic fundraising appeal, asking the public to dip into their pockets to help UK families plunged into poverty by cuts and the recession. whodhavethoughtit  writes:  &quot;The nearest park is one and a half miles away, too far to trek with a baby in a pram.&quot;I do feel for the young family in the article. I was once in that position myself (over 30 years ago) so I know what a struggle it is on a limited income. But that one sentence really stood out for me in the article. Was it a direct quote from the mother or the OP&apos;s take on the situation.When my children were young, I used to walk everywhere, (silver cross pram, baby asleep, toddler sitting on the end); sometimes to get to the cheaper shops, sometimes the park. (Lightwater to Camberley and back for those who know the area)I still walk one and half miles to work everyday and one and half miles back. Granted I am not pushing pram but I am pushing 60.Getting out of the house for a bit fresh air, and to entertain my kids, was a blessed relief and stopped me getting depressed about my situation. I just think it&apos;s a shame that some people consider 1.5 miles an impossible feat.  haldir says:  If Save the Children were really serious about tackling child poverty in the UK, they would be lobbying the government to help the working poor: eg. raising the minimum wage, and tax breaks for married/cohabiting couples.There is no incentive, as this article shows, for a couple to raise a child or children together, and many reasons not to. AFAIK, the best way out of poverty is the have two parents in a long term relationship, in a stable home looking after their children. Money is secondary to that.  SymbolOfDawn says:  There is a debate on the thread about internet access. Yes libraries are free, but they can be many miles away, buses are not always direct or regular either. When you get outside the major cities then resources like this are becoming rarer.Is the internet important and should it be judged as a need? Many jobs are advertised primarily online and many now require online applications and others some degree of ability in relation to computers. If we want to lift people out of poverty - however it is defined, then having some sort of access to IT is important. Yessome job centres have some IT and free-phone facilities, but again, they can be miles away and only one trip a fortnight might be managable and affordable.  breakingtheshell adds:  I think that the case study is really important in raising some of the dichotomies that can affect poverty in the UK: working for a living but on such a low wage that creates financial hardships (&quot;The couple calculated they&apos;d be better off if Locke were a lone parent, or if Rooks gave up work&quot;); money for food but not nutritious food (&quot;The couple regularly miss meals and have to forgo fresh vegetables and fruit&quot;); etc.However, I do not see how the Save the Children (STC) fund will address any of these issues in depth.On one hand, it looks to me like the STC are leveraging the value of an appeal to prove to the Govt/business that the living wage is not sufficient - this is not a bad thing per se and it indicates the complex and sensitive role of organisations that deal with policy change.On the other hand, by focussing on (to paraphrase) &apos;toys, treats, trips and clothes&apos;, the STC fund does a disservice to what are really important structural problems - summarised by the case study and the comments above. e.g. high taxation levels V high financial state support needed to live decently; low infrastructure for children&apos;s comfort, growth and development; quantity V quality of food; working wage v living wage; etc.Let&apos;s hope nothing gets lost in the way forwards...  Should we teach coding to UK school kids? Following the Guardian&apos;s digital literacy campaign this year, a number of readers said a radical overhaul to the way information and communication technology (ICT) is taught in schools is needed. Following the news that all public school children in Estonia will learn to code, Guardian readers voted heavily in favour of British schoolchildren being taught similarly. KingARK  says:    I think we actually need a whole digital curriculum to equip young people in the workplaces of tomorrow. As a recent graduate I have become increasingly frustrated at my own lack of technical knowledge. Like most comments here, I agree that coding is a step in the right direction but we need to overhaul &apos;ICT&apos; to encompass all areas of digital development.  crazyjane  writes:   It&apos;s not a binary question. The whole thing would depend on how well it was taught and what is meant by coding. There&apos;s a bit more to designing programs than writing code. That&apos;s the minimal skill level. It&apos;s the difference between being able to read about a Hungry Caterpillar and about the significance of Madeleines.For primary school children it&apos;s more important that they develop logical reasoning, perhaps initially through games. That is the basis for understanding the processes involved in creating programs. Design skills and coding can come after that. Some would be able to handle it at a young age but that&apos;s true for any subject.  sapphochops  adds:   My son starts A level computing today, this is the first year his school has run this course, we got him a Raspberry Pi and beginners Python book over the summer holidays. I&apos;m pleased that his school is offering A level computing rather than A level ICT, he is hoping to using these skills in conjunction with whatever career he ends up following  cherade9 writes:   My son is waiting for his Raspberry Pi and case to arrive for his borthday this weekend, along with his Beginners Python book. He&apos;s about to be 13 and terribly excited at the prospect. I&apos;m going to apply to our school PTA for a small fund to buy a half dozen Pi&apos;s and get some donated lego to build cases, then have an after school club for parents and kids to code together.You can probably gather I think coding at high school is a great plan. Knowing how computers work, how to make them actually do things, rather than knowing how to use programs on them is extremely important in the modern world!  reesphilliprees says:   I am a primary school teacher and as part of my maths and IT teaching I spend a fortnight teaching pupils (from Y3 to Y6) to write their own procedures using LOGO. This sets them up to &quot;want&quot; to find out more as the time available is so limited. I teach them to design their procedures so that they can easily be read and changed. Over the past decade, the parents of over 2/3s of each class of pupils report that they have downloaded a free version of LOGO to play around with at home.The curriculum does allow for us to teach coding in our primary schools and it is great fun for children of all abilities.  prjy writes:    Echoing the earlier comments, it does depend a lot on the definition of coding or programming. I completed a Computer Science GCSE myself and have found that more often than not it is the principals of logic and decision modelling that I reuse rather than the coding practices and language I was taught. Having worked in IT for the past 12 years I am often disappointed that some of my younger colleagues have only a vague grasp of Maths and Logic. All that said, I am concerned that we may be trying to teach something to children at an age where they are ill equipped to understand it as fully as they would need to. I&apos;m not sure how others see the integration of maths, english and computer science but I worry that too much emphasis on computer science at an early age would produce students that could &apos;code&apos; parrot fashion but were unable to be creative in the subject.  Chris Middleton says:   This would depend on what the definition of &quot;coding&quot; is. HTML (for websites) isn&apos;t actually code, it&apos;s a mark-up language. Coding ie. java, vb, php - yes, I think children should learn the basics of it. Especially when we&apos;re in a day and age when technology is growing more and more all the time. We&apos;ll always need someone to code something even if the end product is performed by a robot.  EasyJet moves to allocated seats EasyJet is ending the desperate rush for prime seats on low-cost flights by launching allocated seating across its network. Readers shared their views and own personal experiences of low-cost air travel: oommph  says:   One of the odd things about this is that it&apos;s infected airlines with allocated seats. People line up for ages before gates open often (as others say) just to board a bus that they will ultimately be last off.The whole process shows the diffrence between the cool and the anxious.  MilanoEd writes:    I flew from Amsterdam to Stansted when they were trialling this system. It was the first time I&apos;d encountered it...as it&apos;s such a short flight I didn&apos;t want to waste money paying to choose my seat, so declined to pay extra. And was then allocated a middle seat. (Which was annoying - I&apos;ve travelled on Ryanair and Easyjet dozens and dozens of times, often alone, and have hardly ever had to sit in a middle seat....one doesn&apos;t have to barge, one merely has to try to position yourself near the doors on the bus - and I&apos;m 6&apos;2&quot; and 15 stone, so there&apos;s lots of me to fit in).Anyway, my strategy in the future will be to check in online at the last possible moment before I leave for the airport. That way, provided there are 50 people who have checked in before me and haven&apos;t wanted to pay (assuming 25 rows on the aircraft) then all the middle seats will have been allocated to them.  Montagu62 writes:    About time. Having spent years up and down to Scotland the seat scrum, especially with family, is always a stressful nightmare. Having moved to Australia where both virgin and jetstar allocate seats it almost makes it a joy to travel. From observation its does seem to affect boarding times either. As for the front seats well they get allocated to frequent flyers as a perk sowhy not charge for the privilege.  granted adds:    Actually, far be it from me to praise Easyjet, but...we went on one of the trials this summer with 3 young kids and it is much better and was much less stressful. Personally, I don&apos;t think most people care what seat they&apos;re in as long as they are with family and friends (unless they are very tall). So I suspect more large groups esp families will book with easyjet now that the (major) hassle that getting seats together has been removed.So I suspect it will be very profitable for easyjet in terms of increased customer numbers and beneficial (less stressful) for customers.Am hoping the other cheap airlines see this and follow suit.All we need now is for an airline to reintroduce a free plane meal, to entice customers and we&apos;lll be back to the flying experience being the pleasant one it was when I was a kid in the 70s.  rightwinggit notes:    They&apos;re already doing it.I travelled on EasyJet last weekend and you got automatically allocated seating. I checked in myself and one other person and we were sat next to each other even though the flight was full. I didn&apos;t pay to choose a particular seat.On the return journey we got moved from our seats to the emergency exit seats in the middle of the aircraft because a disabled person had been allocated those. It didn&apos;t matter much to us but we weren&apos;t really given a choice either.Overall the system seems fine. It isn&apos;t worth the extra money to get a particular seat IMO but if you want to pay extra then good luck to you.  PeterTon adds:   Budget airlines bring out the worst in too many people. That is why I&apos;ve reached the point where I hate flying. That is also one of the very few situations where I resent not being better well off. I already pretty much always end up in a middle seat because I firmly wait sited for the herd to have finished boarding (it can stay on hoof for the best part of three-quarters of an hour), so I welcome the news. But for pit sake, don&apos;t tell me they have done it for the our benefit!  Helen121  adds:    We arrived late for an Easyjet flight this summer and it was SO much less stressful. Went straight through passport control, no queue and straight on to plane to aisle seats which was just fine.I think there is some psychological resentment that accompanies lowcost flying. Somehow, I just resent every gouge of extra cash they try and make out of me and refuse to play, even though I am supposedly saving money by flying with them. Actually, now I always check BA flights as 50% of the time they are as cheap as EasyJet or RyanAir and I have a nice relaxed flight. It has become a luxury to fly with a normal airline, and I appreciate it 100% more after the cattle-truck concept and feel of EasyRyan.  Relaxation of planning laws David Cameron and Nick Clegg attempted to kick-start the economy - and the coalition&apos;s fortunes - by announcing a package of measures designed to boost the housing industry and growth through an injection of cash, looser planning laws and the lifting of requirements for developers to build affordable homes. Aldeveron writes:    Allowing people to build extensions to their houses without planning permission will cause untold conflict and ill-will between neighbours when people lose their views or lose daylight, finding their houses devalued as a result. Of course, it will create plenty of work for already-overpaid lawyers who will be hired to sort out the prolific mess and conflict this will cause. Of course, the people who come up with these ideas have probably never lived in the kind of district where this kind of problem is a potential issue.  ShiningBeacon says:    This whole idea makes me shiver. Surely part of the security for anyone having an extension built is that the local planning officer comes around to check that it is compliant in terms of depth of foundations, suporting walls etc. It is a recipe for cowboys builders to have a field day if that level of control is not going to exist.  bhainart, a housing designer, adds:  I work in construction (design) and I have had two clients in the past two years who have found money (bequeathed) to build an extension to their homes. The market for even modest extensions is dead in the wealthy part of the Fylde coast where I live (which co-incidentally is rabid Tory country). For the past 2 years I have been freelancing producing 3D &quot;as built&quot; pipe models for petro-chemical/nuclear contractor in Warrington. Not my first choice for a career but it helps keep the wolf from the door. The day is fast approaching when I have to decide to become permanent staff and leave construction for good. After suffering many years of boom bust in my career I have decided that enough is enough and I will not be returning to housing, public or private. This latest announcement from this lot is meaningless  StuartRG writes:  I lost my home two years ago thanks to a lying property developer and an equally complicit Local Authority planning department. (Lincoln) If the planning laws a re relaxed then I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be the only person in the UK who trusts neither as far as he can throw them If the Govt are using China&apos;s planning regulations as a comparison, why don&apos;t they go the whole hog and copy their policy on corrupt officialdom i.e. the death penalty. One can but dream...  Opimian says:  I was talking to a small builder recently (sole trader, not small in stature) and his complaint was not about the planning system but that the banks are not lending money for building projects and as a result thousands of building workers are either unemployed or under-employed. I don&apos;t know whether my area is typical but there are many half-finished or abandoned building projects around here. I get the impression that many small builders borrow money incrementally rather than borrowing the entire cost of the scheme at the beginning. Having completed the first stage, they then find that nobody will provide the funds to continue.So planning laws are largely a red herring and all the talk about relaxing rules on conservatories tells us which demographic this particular dog whistle is aimed at  LostIncontinent adds his perspective as a local councillor:  I can&apos;t really add to the sage comments already posted, but from my POV as a councillor who sits on the planning committee, I can assure Cleggeron that councils are minded to give permission in the vast majority of cases, as outlined by the guy from the LGA. In fact, given the cost of losing an appeal by a builder, it&apos;d madness to reject permission in nearly all cases, which means that we can get a rough ride from local protesters (who&apos;d probably also slag off the council, were they to reject permission and then lose the case!). It&apos;s an incoherent set of proposals that only seem to favour the big builders keen to shirk any 106 responsibilities in favour of more lucrative house types. That and the rush to delist areas of greenbelt seem to me to be aimed purely at boosting sales of high end houses on leafy sites and bugger the proles at the bottom. If the public at large don&apos;t see this announcement as the crock of shit it is, I&apos;d be horrified.  VSLVSL writes:  One of the major areas where planning permission is currently refused is because the area of permitted development has already been reached, but an owner is unaware of this. Typically, a property has been extended many years previously e.g. in the 1950&apos;s and a new purchaser then subsequently has their application to extend turned-down on the basis that no further development is permitted. It would be useful to readers if The Guardian could identify whether in the event that my neighbour inappropriately extends their property under this relaxation who I should be suing for damages where the development reduces the value and amenity of my property. Should I be addressing my claim to my neighbour, or should it be the Conservative Party or to David Cameron in person? Also can The Guardian also clarify what impact this proposal has upon building regulations - for example is the government proposing to &apos;relax&apos; regulations around fire-safety in homes in multiple occupation as part of this drive? Will I be permitted to do a loft conversion which is a fire hazard?

When the Dutch go to the polls on Wednesday in an early election seen across Europe as a bellwether ballot, the well-to-do, middle-class 64-year-old will embody the volatility surrounding the vote. &quot;You&apos;ve got the Germans bossing us around. Taxes are going to go up, pensions are going to be cut. And all this because of Europe. It would be much better just to let Greece leave the euro and carry on with the strong countries,&quot; he said. &quot;The Socialists are much better for the common people.&quot; The Socialists, who have renounced their 1970s Maoism and have never been in government, look poised to double their seats in the election by campaigning against Europe and the austerity that has sent governments toppling across the union, including the Netherlands, a successful prosperous core EU member with low unemployment and high quality of life. Between them, the hard-left Socialists and thefar-right Freedom party, united in their hostility to Brussels, their resistance to austerity at home, and their opposition to helping the struggling eurozone countries of the south, look likely to take a third of the 150-seat parliament, shifting the\u00a0terms of the national debate and complicating the eurozone&apos;s fight to survive. &quot;It will be a big anti-European bloc,&quot; said Sarah de Lange, an Amsterdam University political scientist. &quot;This campaign is all about Europe. The Netherlands have gone from being the most reliable ally on Europe to very hostile.&quot; In Maastricht, the small wealthy southern town synonymous with EU integration and best known as the birthplace of the euro 20 years ago, the mood is sour. &quot;I&apos;m voting for Wilders,&quot; said Jo, a cafe owner, referring to the far-right anti-Islam populist, Geert Wilders and his Freedom party. &quot;He&apos;s the only one who talks straight. He was the first to say we should get out of the euro. Now everyone&apos;s saying it.&quot; While neither the hard left nor the far right are likely to make it into government, their success in shaping the agenda has also forced the mainstream parties, particularly on the centre right, to turn much more Eurosceptic, with the interim prime minister, Mark Rutte, declaring in a TV debate that Greece is not getting another euro of Dutch taxpayers&apos; money. Rutte&apos;s centre-right minority coalition collapsed in April because of Europe. Now its fate will be decided by how the voters feel about Europe. The Rutte government, lined up alongside the Germans, was the most hawkish in preaching austerity to Greece and other eurozone laggards. It was then hoisted on its own petard when it emerged that spending cuts and tax rises worth up to \u20ac16bn would be needed if Holland was to meet its EU-set budget deficit target by next year. Wilders pulled the plug on the minority government by vetoing welfare cuts, triggering Wednesday&apos;s election. Seen as to blame for bringing down the government, Wilders, who has with some success sought to turn the election into a referendum on Europe (Dutch out), looks to be a loser, forecast to forfeit a quarter of his 24 seats. But analysts point out that Wilders regularly polls less than he actually achieves. The Socialists have been the big beneficiary of the turmoil and the extreme unpredictability, although they have gone down in the most recent polls because of the lacklustre performance of its leader, Emile Roemer, in the TV debates. &quot;The television debates have had a huge impact,&quot; said Paul Nieuwenburg, a politics professor at Leiden University. &quot;The volatility is a reflection of the incoherence of the parties as they scramble for votes. Wilders has wrought havoc by understanding clearly that people are very disaffected with the traditional parties.&quot; The election is being watched closely in Brussels and across Europe not only for the message a founding EU member sends about the union&apos;s worst-ever crisis, but because Dutch politics are often a reliable gauge of broader European political trends, from the rise of maverick populists a decade ago, to the referendum rejection of a European constitution in 2005. The sense is that most Dutch remain guardedly pro-EU and in favour of the single currency. But they are reluctant to transfer more budgetary and fiscal powers to Brussels \u2013 the EU elite&apos;s response to the crisis. And they are unhappy with deep spending cuts made quickly to meet EU targets by next year. Such a policy is likely to keep Brussels happy but throw the country into an unnecessary recession, whereas a slower, more phased programme of reforms would do less damage to a fundamentally sound economy. Reflecting the public mood as well as the pressure from the political extremes, centrist parties, always strongly pro-EU, are now sounding much more ambivalent. An academic study of the manifestos and statements of the 12 parties expected to enter the new parliament found only three could be described as unequivocally pro-EU and pro-euro. Among those three is the mainstream centre-left Dutch Labour party, which was in the doldrums only weeks ago, but has staged a remarkable recovery due to the strong TV performances of its new leader, Diederik Samsom, and is now running neck-and-neck with Rutte&apos;s rightwing liberals, the VVD, at the top of the polls and clawing back support from the hard left.

More than 350 Dutch coffee shops have thrown their weight behind a grassroots campaign in support of the leftwing Socialist Party (SP), which has pledged to end the political crackdown on shops that sell marijuana. Staff have been selling skunk in SP T-shirts and handing out branded filter-tips. And the stakes are high: many believe that the parliamentary elections will be make-or-break day for the Dutch coffee shops. It&apos;s now four months since the &quot;weed pass&quot; was introduced in the south of the Netherlands, designating coffee shops as private clubs open only to Dutch residents. For some, revenue has declined by as much as 60%. Foreigners no longer show up, and neither do locals. &quot;They don&apos;t want to be registered as smokers,&quot; explains campaign leader Nol van Schaik. The number of street dealers has reportedly sky-rocketed; recently a nine-year-old was caught offering weed to passersby in the city of Geleen. And on 1 January next year, the weed pass will be extended to the rest of the country. No more spliffs or hash brownies for tourists in Amsterdam, the coffee shops believe, unless voters get behind the SP, which has promised to abolish the weed pass, legalise marijuana and use the extra taxes to help reduce the deficit. Which is why, with a campaign budget of more than \u20ac100,000, the SP promo tour has been travelling to 23 towns, complete with a US school bus equipped with a DJ booth, and an &quot;awareness limousine&quot;. Two planes towing banners fly along the coast on sunny days. Dozens of radio commercials are airing on a popular youth station. At least 10 parties are likely to get a seat in parliament and several have pro-cannabis views, but coffee shops pledged support for the SP when the elections looked like a two-horse race between the SP and the &quot;liberal&quot; VVD, which supports the &quot;weed pass&quot;. Recently the Labour party started surging in the polls. &quot;We still support the SP but if Labour keeps rising we might give last minute advice to vote for them. They also want to abandon the weed pass. We have to vote strategically to stop the VVD from pursuing its disastrous policy,&quot; says Van Schaik.

Born in Inverkeilor, Angus, the great-grandson of the 8th Earl of Elgin and 12th Earl of Kincardine, he was raised at Farley Hill Place in Berkshire, where his father utilised his five children&apos;s musical potential and formed a string quartet, with Robert playing the cello. Music was his great passion and he obtained a first class degree in the subject from Edinburgh University. After graduating, he studied composition under Julius R\u00f6ntgen in Amsterdam. The war then intervened and, as a conscientious objector, Robert worked in London during the blitz, then as a porter at Gloucester Royal Infirmary, where he met the formidable nursing sister Beatrice Tomboline, whom he married in 1941. They had three children \u2013 Richard, Katharine and James. However, Robert then had a change of heart, enlisted for service and was sent to Greenwood, Nova Scotia, for training. He became a de Havilland Mosquito navigator in RCAF 418 Squadron, flying with the Canadian pilot Russell Bannock. Together they shot down nine enemy aircraft and 19 V-1 flying bombs over the English Channel. A newspaper headline proclaimed: &quot;These two airmen spell death to Nazis!&quot; One mission saw them flying across much of occupied Europe at night, with one engine. Robert was awarded the DFC and bar. After the war, he began a teaching career and became lecturer in music at Cardiff University from 1947 until his retirement in 1977. He composed various pieces which were recorded and performed by, among others, the BBC Orchestra of Wales. In the late 1990s, he recorded his Symphony in B flat, dedicated to Bannock and in part inspired by the night sorties they flew together. Robert and Beatrice lived an active and full life until her death in 2010, travelling widely and cultivating their shared interest in gardening. He retained his interest in music and enjoyed the company of his many friends and growing family. His eldest son, Richard, died in 2007.

As many countries are throwing off the old orders, how can fundraisers take advantage of new opportunities? Mark Cook of Moving Thinking tells a story of the experiences of his uncle, an English ex-pat living in a small village in rural Thailand. The local temple regularly requests donations from people living in the village to fund small things like building a new shack for a destitute villager, refurbishing a classroom in the village school or helping a family with medical bills. The interesting part of the system is the attitude to donor privacy \u2013 or lack of it. In the centre of the village is a telegraph pole with a loud speaker attached to it for important public announcements. The temple uses this to announce the names of everyone that supports the current fundraiser, along with how much they&apos;ve given. And they make these announcements loudly and often. The effect is powerful. Donors feel publicly recognised and feel good about doing it again. As a resident it is very hard to avoid donating (your neighbours will know and chastise you). A specific sum is usually requested and you must give around that sum or people will think you&apos;re mean. The wealthy villagers will often give high amounts to get the kudos of giving the most. It&apos;s a system that seems to work, but for a reserved Englishman it&apos;s excruciating. It tells us a lot about our expectations that our giving remain private and the comfort that affords. Sustainability is an issue in the Arab world. Atallah Kuttab, founder and chairman of SAANED for Philanthropy Advisory in the Arab Region, says: &quot;Fundraising in the Arab world is nascent and complex \u2013 intertwining between regulatory and religious, both in fundraising and service delivery. In some Arab countries, making a charitable donation to help those in another country can be illegal if it is outside the sanction of the government and if you do this you can get into big trouble. But people still give. In the move to strategic giving we are asking governments to relax rules on giving so strategic giving is easier.&quot; On the religious side, Islam has three ways of giving. Foremost and most ingrained in Islam&apos;s attitude to philanthropy is zakat where you are required to give a certain percentage (usually 2.5%) of your wealth above the amount you need to live on to charity. Indeed, there is an argument whether this should be seen as &apos;charity&apos; or is more a &apos;right&apos; of poor people. Then there is waqf, which is similar to an endowment in Judaeo/Christian religion. Indeed, waqf is the forerunner of western giving, having been introduced by returning crusaders. There are guidelines as to how much you can give and where it should go. You must state what you are giving, what the intent is and who is the beneficiary. For example, you might give a sum of money to build a hospital to help the people of a certain city. Thirdly is sadaqa, &quot;voluntary charity&apos; which is flexible \u2013 how much you want to give out on top of zakat \u2013 for public benefit. It might be donating money, volunteering or sponsoring an orphan. Atallah says: &quot;The religious side to giving is self-driving and you cannot do much with it, but you can find ways.&quot; In Libya now there is legislation being discussed for charities and Islamic ways of giving, but it is early days. One encouraging development is that whereas before the Arab Spring most Arab &apos;family&apos; giving went to support causes on their doorsteps, it has recently been mobilised to support the opposition movements that toppled the Libyan regime, and the same seems to be happening in Syria. Atallah says: &quot;It was very moving to hear the story of the young Libyan living in Turkey who sold all the property he had inherited to fund the medical treatment of Libyans arriving in Turkey from Misrata in Libya and mobilised thousands of dollars from the Libyan diaspora and from people across the Arab region.&quot; It is clear that each region around the world has different cultures, channels, modes of interpersonal relationships (particularly about charity) and different infrastructures. Thus each region has different lessons to teach the rest of the world about fundraising. In tune with this, the International Fundraising Congress for the first time ever, this year will be introducing specific sessions offering new perspectives, case studies and insights on fundraising from different geographical areas around the globe including Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. These sessions have been design to allow fundraisers to learn from others how best to overcome regional challenges, enabling them to successfully raise funds and friends to solve global problems. Neelam Makhijani, chief executive of the Resource Alliance highlights &quot;There are fundraisers from over 60 different countries that come to the IFC which brings together such diversity. At this year&apos;s Congress, we are showcasing amazing fundraising stories from small and medium sized NGOs from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle east. These stories will touch you, inspire you and will be a great source for learning. It is vital to the sector that fundraisers come together from across the globe to learn from each other and take advantage of different approaches. By doing this we can help create a strong and sustainable civil society for the future.&quot; Jon Shepherd is head of marketing and communications at the Resource Alliance, which is organising the International Fundraising Congress in Amsterdam from 16-19 October this year.

His opinions will be familiar and respected. His books will grace their shelves. They will, though, be a bit surprised to learn that after years of trying to persuade London politicians to make bold but sane changes to they way people get around the capital he is now seeking office himself as Labour&apos;s mayoral candidate for 2016. Why? Wolmar writes:  At the last two mayoral elections, neither Boris [Johnson] nor Ken [Livingstone] set out anything that could remotely approximate to a vision. Both their manifestos were a ragbag of vague ideas designed to appease various interest groups rather than an attempt to set out what a 21st century city should look like. The 2008 hustings focussed on whether bendy buses were suitable for London streets, while this year the main source of debate was over fares \u2013 an important issue but not one that should have dominated the debate.  True enough. He continues:  Let&apos;s instead begin to look at what is wrong with central London. There is no doubt that London is a very successful city, but it could do so much better. By introducing the congestion charge, Ken Livingstone started what should have been a coherent process of gradually shifting the focus away from a policy that had the needs of motorists at the heart of transport policy towards a recognition that there was a need to restrict the movement of cars. He also greatly improved bus services and supported investment in the Tube and London Overground. Trafalgar Square was part pedestrianised but then Livingstone somewhat lost his nerve and failed to press home the advantage he gained from these changes.  Right again. And Mayor Johnson?  Boris, on the other hand, has been a muddle. He proclaims his support for cyclists but actually in many respects has made life more difficult for them by insisting that nothing should be done that might affect the &quot;smooth flow of traffic.&quot; The bike hire scheme is a nice innovation and is a useful way of introducing people to the joys of cycling but it is not a substitute for the type of provision for cyclists seen in many European cities. For all Boris&apos;s supposed pro-cycling policies, very little will change over the next four years to attract more of them or to make existing ones safer. His cycle superhighways are a dangerous mirage, encouraging cyclists on to main roads while doing nothing to protect them.  Not only a muddle but a regressive one, putting pals, private interests and self-publicity before the economic and environmental needs of the metropolis. By contrast, Wolmar&apos;s transport vision for London is of a city that functions more cleanly, enjoyably and efficiently.  A core priority would be, as Wolmar puts it, &quot;weaning the city off its addiction to the car,&quot; which would mean setting targets to reduce the number of vehicles coming into central London and developing a more sophisticated congestion charging system. &quot;Singapore started off with something very basic like ours,&quot; he says, &quot;but it has evolved using newer technology.&quot; In an article on his campaign website, originally written for the Times, he argues for a far more radical approach to cycling provision:  Doing everything from creating a high-class set of priority lanes for cyclists to making the roads safe enough for children and their parents to cycle to school. The idea is not necessarily to get a few more cyclists on the road tomorrow but, rather, to ensure that there is such a radical step change in the provision of both education and facilities that London will never be the same again. Only when we see old ladies cycling on London&apos;s streets, as they do in Copenhagen or Amsterdam, will we know that we have succeeded.  He argues that once a target is set for reducing the numbers of cars, &quot;every others policy will flow: pedestrianisation schemes, bus priority, 20 mph zones, and one-hour tickets for bus users (an idea the London Assembly Liberal Democrats have long argued for) among them. Wolmar will be an outsider to secure Labour&apos;s nomination, but he assures me that is is deadly serious. A long-time party member (in case you were wondering), he&apos;s been taking soundings and preparing his candidacy since despairing at the poverty of debate during this year&apos;s mayoral contest. He says he has two objectives: one is to win the contest to become Labour&apos;s candidate, the other is to get his ideas discussed and absorbed into the mainstream where they belong. The Olympic and Paralympic period has shown that people living and working in London can use public transport differently and that road space can be rationed without the sky falling in - essentially the points made in a different way by Transport for London commissioner Peter Hendy to the London Assembly&apos;s transport committee on Tuesday. London 2012 has provided a glimpse of an achievable brighter future for the capital&apos;s transport networks, and few are better equipped than Christian Wolmar to build on and articulate that hopeful theme.", "sentences": ["Only when we see old ladies cycling on London&apos;s streets, as they do in Copenhagen or Amsterdam, will we know that we have succeeded."], "title": "Transport commentator Christian Wolmar launches mayoralty bid", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davehillblog/2012/sep/12/christian-wolmar-lanuches-london-mayoralty-bid", "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "London", "Ken Livingstone", "London politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-13T11:24:00Z", "article": "Last week was Berlin Music Week 2012, an annual industry showcase conference that this year played host to German organisation, the Green Music Initiative: a not-for-profit project that provides music companies, venues and festivals with concrete measures to save resources and money, including light, power and staging. The GMI is a project that belongs to Berlin based think-tank Thema1, which specialises in accelerating the transition to a low-carbon society. In the UK, the GMI&apos;s nearest equivalents are NPOs such as Julie&apos;s Bicycle and A Greener Festival, the latter of which successfully set up an awards scheme in 2007 to help inspire all festivals to become more ecologically aware. In an ever-present recession many arts, culture and music festivals continue to fall. OK, so market saturation might also be a factor and in the UK, perhaps the weather too. Nonetheless, festivals are energy devouring monsters and are a long way from being 100% fully sustainable, so the need to promote green ideas and the practices of sustainable methods grows ever stronger. In Berlin the GMI proudly introduced the music industry to their Sunplugged stage, which will be 100% powered by a combination of renewable energy sources including on-site generated solar power, wind turbines and pedal power. The expectation is that the stage will be launched at the 2013 Melt! Festival in Germany. Sunplugged is a technically excellent endeavour, as you would expect from a German organisation, and on the face of it quite a bold move given that it will cost in excess of \u20ac200,000 to put together and install. A cost not easily explained away given that a continuing priority of the GMI is to dispel the myth that going green is financially an expensive operation. The first step to achieving Sunplugged was the installation of a 3,000 metre squared solar roof at the visually stunning Ferropolis Festival site in Germany, formerly an open-cast coal mine. Ferropolis and the GMI have strived to turn the site into a &quot;walkable Energiewende&quot; \u2013 an energy transition point. The GMI are keen for the technology behind the Sunplugged stage to be rolled out to any festival that wants it. This is not something exclusive to Melt!; If others seize upon the stage then the awareness it inspires, as well as the continuing quality and integrity of artists booked at festivals like Melt! would be a more than adequate return on investment. Founder of the GMI Jacob Bilabel commented: &quot;Organisations like Live Nation and Festival Republic know about it and all they have to do is say: yes we want it. And it&apos;s theirs! The idea to &apos;never touch a running system&apos; is well established so some [organisations] might fear what it will do to their production practices and pray that things might just stay that way forever. Others embrace change and innovation.&quot; Music and arts festivals in the UK are making substantial advances where sustainability is concerned. But the emphasis seems to be geared more towards creating awareness by incentivising the individual, rather than embracing monumental and expensive technics. Bestival, which took place this month on the Isle of Wight continues to push green initiatives by promoting the use of public transport, car sharing and sourcing local produce and services. There is a Tomorrow&apos;s World field, which is all about envisaging and inspiring a green and fun future, as well as a solar powered bandstand, running for four hours a day. Also, and perhaps a little more taxing on the individual, is a swim and kayak across the Solent for charity as a means of getting to and from the camp. Julie&apos;s Bicycle, which inspires many festivals in the UK and abroad, extend their awareness policy to the artists, and has helped a number of high-profile names practice what they preach when it comes to sustainability. Their Industry Green certification, an environmental certification scheme for festivals, venues, offices and CD packaging has appeared on CD releases by Kate Nash, Robbie Williams and many more, helping to ensure that the environmental impact has been kept to a minimum. With the Melt! Festival&apos;s long history of successful green projects, the Sunplugged stage is the next logical step. But it is by no means a unique project. 100% green energy events such as pedal power stages have been in the ascendance for some time \u2013 the San Francisco Bicycle Music Festival utilised 14 bikes to pedal power a small stage for five hours in 2011. In Amsterdam, The United Music Events Foundation (UMEF) constructed a small scale 100% pedal powered stage at the Boerenrock Festival. UMEF&apos;s awareness and production manager Bas Kragt, visiting Berlin Music Week said: &quot;The Sunplugged stage is a great project, but it shouldn&apos;t be that special. I&apos;m really convinced that this should be the standard for every stage on every festival in the future \u2013 initiated at government level. In the Netherlands the pedal power stage really worked out, but more in an awareness-like way. In Germany the people are more technical-minded, which explains the cost.&quot; It&apos;s clear there is a certain amount of sticking one&apos;s neck out if an established festival is to embrace a project of this size, so this is a brave move for Melt! and they should be applauded if it goes ahead in 2013, successful or not. But the true reward for green campaigners everywhere would be to see how many festivals follow, governmentally assisted or not, and invest in the bigger and more technical projects like Sunplugged.

You can learn much more about late-Victorian London from Conan Doyle than Henry James. True to form, Switch by Charlie Brooks, published by the pioneering Blue Door imprint of Harper Collins, is not only a promising diversion, it tells us quite a bit about its author, the husband of Rebekah Brooks who goes on trial this autumn on charges relating to the phone-hacking scandal. Mr Brooks has always stood by his wife, asserting her innocence. On the dedication page of Switch, he goes one further. She is, he writes, &quot;the best wife in the world \u2013 who inspires me with her sense of decency, her clarity of thought and her integrity.&quot; Immediately before this touching, and slightly defiant tribute, the reader learns that Brooks was educated at Eton, but left &apos;&quot;to become a stable lad&quot;. Subsequently, he has worked as &quot;a racehorse trainer&quot; and a newspaper columnist (for the Daily Telegraph). All in all, a promising CV for a would-be thriller writer. The disappointment of Switch is that almost none of this is explored in what follows. True, we get glimpses of the hero&apos;s adulterous girlfriend, Gemma. &quot;She still took his breath away. Her long flowing hair falling down her back, her dress clinging to her body just enough to be tantalisingly sexy, and best of all those exquisite calf muscles.&quot; Don&apos;t misread this. Gemma is not just good in bed, she is troubled, too. &quot;She was such a confused soul. Spoilt and self-centred on the one hand, and yet generous and insecure on the other.&quot; Brooks has read enough thrillers to know that the love-interest should step coquettishly into view no later than chapter two (check), give our hero (Max Ward) the rogering of his life (check), and then hover tantalisingly on the periphery of the action (check), offering up her body for occasional work-outs either in bed, or on a &quot;very comfortable Moroccan rug&quot; (check). Students of Charlie Brooks&apos; life and times will be interested to know that Max first met Gemma on &quot;a typical, wild Gloucestershire weekend party. Everyone drank too much and a few people ended up doing things they shouldn&apos;t... Max had followed her upstairs to bed. By the time he knocked on her door, she was wearing the skimpiest of nighties...&quot; Sadly, Max Ward, happy-go-lucky &quot;MI6 spook&quot;, does not confine his attentions to sexy Gemma. He&apos;s also playing away with Sophie. On top of this, he&apos;s whizzing about 21st-century Europe like a fruit fly on speed, pursuing &quot;a mission&quot; that involves an old master painting, some unlikely intelligence shenanigans, and a pervasive air of menace. Plainly with a possible movie deal in view, each chapter of Switch opens in another posh EU location. Now Monaco, now Amsterdam, anon London (and, weirdly, Eton). Note to author: cut the flashbacks. They slow the action, and confuse the hell out of the reader. By the not-so-shattering climax of Switch, three things are clear. First, this is really a first draft with several potential stories (all of them under-explored). Second, Brooks has broken the first rule of thrillers: write about what you know. Horses, Gloucestershire, yes. International intelligence, no. His MI6 is, frankly, incredible. Third, the reader cries out for at least one even vaguely likeable, or interesting, character. In place of an engaging cast, Brooks has spun a confusing, over-complicated yarn which comes with dutiful puffs from Jeremy Clarkson (&quot;a turbo-charged race to the finish&quot;) and Alex James (&quot;I couldn&apos;t put it down&quot;). Did they, you wonder, actually read it to the end ? I advise Charlie Brooks to flash his copy of Switch en route to court when his wife&apos;s trial starts. It will promote sales \u2013 and a leisured re-reading will show him how to do better next time.", "sentences": ["Now Monaco, now Amsterdam, anon London (and, weirdly, Eton)."], "title": "Charlie Brooks' Switch reveals more than he intended", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/sep/14/charlie-brooks-switch-rebekah-brooks", "tags": ["Books", "Thrillers", "Culture", "Fiction"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-14T15:30:00Z", "article": "We are a few hundred miles from the north pole. The air temperature is -3C, the sea freezing. All around us in these foggy Arctic waters at the top of the world are floes \u2013 large and small chunks of sea ice that melt and freeze again with the seasons. Arne Sorensen, our Danish ice pilot, is 60 feet up in the crow&apos;s nest of the Arctic Sunrise vessel. Visibility is just 200 yards and he inches the 1,000-tonne Greenpeace ice breaker forward at two knots through narrow passages of clear water. The floes are piled up and compressed in fantastic shapes and shades of grey and blue; they crack, rumble and groan as we nudge them aside or climb over them. Two polar bears on our port side lift their heads but resume hunting. Sorensen has sailed deep into ice at both poles for 30 years, but this voyage is different, he says. The edge of the Arctic ice cap is usually far south of where we are now at the very end of the melt season. More than 600,000 square kilometres (sq km) more ice has melted in 2012 than was ever recorded by satellites before. Now the minimum extent has been nearly reached and the sea is starting to refreeze. &quot;This is the new minimum extent of the ice cap,&quot; he says, the &quot;frontline of climate change&quot;. &quot;It is sad. I am not doubting this is related to emitting fossil fuels to a large extent. It&apos;s sad to observe that we are capable of changing the planet to such a degree.&quot; The vast polar ice cap, which regulates the Earth&apos;s temperature and has been a permanent fixture in our understanding of how the world works, has this year retreated further and faster than anyone expected. The previous record, set in 2007, was officially broken on 27 August when satellite images averaged over five days showed the ice then extended 4.11 million sq km, a reduction of nearly 50% compared to just 40 years ago. But since 27 August, the ice just kept melting \u2013 at nearly 40,000 sq km a day until a few days ago. Satellite pictures this weekend showed the cap covering only 3.49m sq km. This year, 11.7m sq km of ice melted, 22% more than the long-term average of 9.18m sq km. The record minimum extent is now likely to be formally called on Monday by the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) in Colorado. The record hasn&apos;t just been broken, it&apos;s been smashed to smithereens, adding weight to predictions that the Arctic may be ice-free in summer months within 20 years, say British, Italian and American-based scientists on board the Arctic Sunrise. They are shocked at the speed and extent of the ice loss. The Cambridge University Sea ice researcher Nick Toberg, who has analysed underwater ice thickness data collected by British nuclear submarine HMS Tireless in 2004 and 2007, said: &quot;This is staggering. It&apos;s disturbing, scary that we have physically changed the face of the planet. We have about 4m sq km of sea ice. If that goes in the summer months that&apos;s about the same as adding 20 years of CO2 at current [human-caused] rates into the atmosphere. That&apos;s how vital the arctic sea ice is. &quot;In the 1970s we had 8m sq km of sea ice. That has been halved. We need it in the summer. It has never decreased like this before&quot;. &quot;We knew the ice was getting thinner but I did not expect we&apos;d lose this much this year. We broke the record by a lot&quot;, says the NSIDC scientist Julienne Stroeve. &quot;The acceleration of the loss of the extent of the ice is mostly because the ice has been so thin. This would explain why it has melted so much this year. By June the ice edge had pulled back to where it normally is in September,&quot; she says. &quot;The 2007 record was set when you had weather conditions which were perfect for melting. This year we didn&apos;t have those. It was mixed. So this suggests the ice has got to a point where it&apos;s so thin it doesn&apos;t matter what the weather is, it&apos;s going to melt in the summer. This could become the new normal,&quot; says Stroeve. In the past Stroeve has shown that ice melt has been happening far faster than the models predicted. Her new research, published last month in the journal Geophysical Research Papers, shows humans may have been responsible for most of the ice loss in recent decades. &quot;It suggests 60% of the observed decline in ice extent in Septembers from 1953-2011 was due to human activity. The decline is linked to the increase in temperatures,&quot; she says. &quot;This year is significant. At the moment the [ice extent] is below what the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report will show in 2014. We are on the extreme edge of the models, suggesting that ice loss is happening much faster than the models suggested,&quot; says Stroeve. All over the Arctic the effects of accelerating ice loss and a warming atmosphere are being seen. The ecology is changing rapidly as trees and plants move north, new beetles devastate whole forests in Canada, Siberia and Alaska, and snowfall increases. Inuit and other communities report more avalanches, the erosion of sea cliffs and melting of the permafrost affecting roads and buildings. Whole coastal communities may have to be moved to avoid sea erosion. With the ice loss has come a rush by industry for Arctic resources. Oil, gas, mining and shipping companies are all expanding operations into areas that until only 20 years ago would have been physically impossible. They bring new opportunities for trade, but new threats to the environment. On Monday, a historic first drilling operation by Shell in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska was halted after sea ice was seen moving towards the oil company&apos;s drill ship. Other new research suggests that the loss of ice could be could be affecting the path and speed of the jet streams, possibly explaining why extreme weather in the northern hemisphere is lasting longer. &quot;There is evidence of stronger and more intense north Atlantic storms and extreme weather, says Stroeve. &quot;We are thinking we are entering a new climate state. Until we get the next push and reach a new equilibrium.&quot; From now on until June, the Arctic sea ice will refreeze. First it will be glassy, thin &quot;shuga&quot;, &quot;grease&quot; or &quot;pancake&quot; ice, unable to bind the floes together. But within weeks, the whole icecap will visibly reform, growing up to 100,000 sq km a day until the melt season begins again next year. But, says Toberg, because of the massive melt this year, there will be less old, or multiyear, ice which is thicker and less prone to melting. The new ice formed this winter will be weaker and more vulnerable to melt, hastening the loss of ice next year. &quot;It is preconditioned to melt&quot;, he says. Now, &quot;feedbacks&quot; are thought to be hastening the ice retreat. In recent summers, say ice experts, Arctic sea surface temperatures have been well above normal, partly because there is less ice to reflect heat back into the atmosphere. The darker open waters now absorb more solar radiation, accelerating the melt. &quot;The ice is weak so it opens up water and allows more sunlight in which warms the water more which makes the ice break up more \u2013 so it accelerates the melt. There is hardly any old, multi-year ice left, so first year ice is now dominant. We are seeing less and less old thick ice,&quot; says Toberg. The longer term implications of the great melt of 2012 are hard to call, say climate scientists who caution that more research is needed. Sea ice plays a critical role in regulating climate, acting as a giant mirror that reflects much of the sun&apos;s energy, helping to cool the Earth. What is suspected is that the formation of the sea ice produces dense salt water which sinks, helping drive the deep ocean currents. Without the summer sea ice, many scientists fear this balance could be upset, potentially causing major climatic changes. &quot;The Arctic ice cover is a lid on the planet that regulates the temperature. By taking it off you are warming it. Temperatures [everywhere] depend on it,&quot; says Toberg. Sea ice extent has varied naturally over the decades with some Russian data suggesting similar or even greater ice loss in some local areas in the 1930s. But the models are clear, says Stroeve. If you omit the observed records, keeping CO2 levels at pre-industrial levels, then none show a decline of ice cover. When you do put CO2 into the models, they all show a decline, she says. &quot;Just because there was possibly less ice in some areas at other times, that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not human-induced now&quot;. &quot;We can expect the Arctic to be ice-free in summer within 20 years, she says. &quot;The ice won&apos;t go away the whole year. It will still be cold enough in the Arctic to freeze in winter. But by 2030 I&apos;d say we will have an ice-free summer Arctic. That does not mean that natural ice variability cannot bring it back again, but the trend, we think, will be downward.&quot; &quot;This is a defining moment in human history,&quot; said Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace International in Amsterdam. &quot;In just over 30 years we have altered the way our planet looks from space and soon the north pole may be completely ice-free in summer. &quot;Fossil fuel companies are still making profits despite the fact that climate change is so clearly upon us. Our politicians are putting corporate interests above scientific warnings and failing in their duties to the public&quot;.", "sentences": ["That does not mean that natural ice variability cannot bring it back again, but the trend, we think, will be downward.&quot; &quot;This is a defining moment in human history,&quot; said Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace International in Amsterdam."], "title": "The staggering decline of sea ice at the frontline of climate change", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/decline-sea-ice-arctic", "tags": ["Sea ice", "Polar regions", "Climate change", "Greenpeace", "Environmental activism", "Oceans", "Environment", "Arctic", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-14T17:34:15Z", "article": "My friend An Dekker, who has\u00a0died at the age of 80,\u00a0lived a very full and eventful life as a\u00a0sculptor, socialist feminist, graphic\u00a0designer and publisher. She was born in Zwolle, in the north\u2011east Netherlands, and told fascinating stories about her communist family fleeing the\u00a0Nazis during the second world war. Her mother sang the Internationale to her as a child, and An said that this influenced her work, her political outlook and the recurring themes of\u00a0her sculptures: war\u00a0and peace, independence, and the\u00a0emotional and physical relations between people. An wanted to be a sculptor from an\u00a0early age. By 1950, after studies at\u00a0the Academy of Fine Arts in Amsterdam, she moved to Paris, where\u00a0she worked with the sculptor Ossip Zadkine. Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Constantin Brancusi and Alberto Giacometti were among the many other sculptors of the first half of\u00a0the 20th century who influenced the\u00a0abstract nature of her work. Her\u00a0first exhibition was held at the\u00a0 Maison\u00a0Carr\u00e9e in N\u00eemes, near France&apos;s southern coast,\u00a0in 1953. Between 1957 and 1971 she lived and worked in Nigeria, where she brought up her four children. It was\u00a0there that her work became influenced by African sculptural figures\u00a0and the theme of\u00a0the Other. Her\u00a0first marriage, to Dick McKone, a\u00a0food chemist, ended with his death in\u00a0an accident in Nigeria, and she separated from her second husband, Tolani Asuni, a psychiatrist. When An arrived in 1972 in London, where she lived until the mid-1980s, the\u00a0women&apos;s liberation movement was in full swing and she threw herself\u00a0into socialist feminist activism. She worked as a graphic designer for socialist and\u00a0feminist publications, as\u00a0a\u00a0publisher\u00a0in the feminist publishing house Sheba, and co-founded, with Eve Barker, Jo Spence and Liz Mackee, the Hackney Flashers photography workshop and the Womens Graphic Workshop, a collective of female graphic designers. I first met An at an international socialist feminist conference in Vincennes, Paris, in 1977. She was thrilled with the political potential of\u00a0such a multicultural mix of women and\u00a0issues.\u00a0Her enthusiasm and warmth\u00a0were infectious. An moved back\u00a0to the Netherlands in\u00a0the mid-80s and set\u00a0up a socialist feminist publishing house which she ran until she left Amsterdam with her partner, the poet\u00a0Ankie Peypers, for\u00a0France in\u00a0the\u00a0late 90s. From 1997 until her death, An returned to sculpture, working in wood, plaster, stone, concrete, steel and bronze, often combining materials, abstraction and figuration. Exhibitions of her work followed, the last one in August 2012 in a village overlooking the\u00a0Lot valley in southern France. Her sculptures represented the serenity she\u00a0so often lacked in a life punctuated by personal tragedy, through which she showed strength, courage, warmth and\u00a0political\u00a0conviction. Ankie died in 2008, and two daughters, Pyrrol and Titi, predeceased An. She is survived by her daughter, Ninon, her son, Tomi, and three grandchildren.", "sentences": ["By 1950, after studies at\u00a0the Academy of Fine Arts in Amsterdam, she moved to Paris, where\u00a0she worked with the sculptor Ossip Zadkine.", "An moved back\u00a0to the Netherlands in\u00a0the mid-80s and set\u00a0up a socialist feminist publishing house which she ran until she left Amsterdam with her partner, the poet\u00a0Ankie Peypers, for\u00a0France in\u00a0the\u00a0late 90s."], "title": "An Dekker obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/an-dekker-obituary", "tags": ["Feminism", "Women", "Culture", "Art and design", "Sculpture", "Art"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-17T12:02:00Z", "article": "Right-click on the song title to download an MP3, or grab a zip file of the whole 38-track compilation through Get it here.  ARGENTINA: ZonaindieSobrenadar \u2013 1859Born in Chaco, Paula Garc\u00eda relocated to Buenos Aires for the first time in 2006 to study music production. Since then, coming and going between Chaco and the capital, she adopted the Sobrenadar identity, developing it through two LPs and three EPs, self-released digitally. 1859 is her latest album, and the highest point of that constant evolution. Released through Bandcamp during the first half of this year, it has already obtained several reviews that name her as one of the most promising new local electronica artists. The song 1859 is a bonus track from a special reissue by Mamushka Dogs Records.  AUSTRALIA: Who the Bloody Hell Are They?Bad Dreems \u2013 Too OldAny of our overseas friends who are fans of the Twerps, do tune in. Sydney via Adelaide four-piece Bad Dreems are one of the best Australian bands at the moment (in our humble opinion). Too Old is about a fizzling relationship, with a nod to the humdrum routine somewhere in between. Its delivery is anything but boring, though. Loose treble riffs, vocalist Ben Marwe&apos;s casual drone and arguably the catchiest hook being passed around all make this track so great. If only everyone else took a cue from these guys and stopped trying so hard to sound good. Downer-pop at its best.  AUSTRIA: Walzerk\u00f6nigDust Covered Carpet \u2013 Fragile Soul/Heavy Heart&quot;A rooftop above concrete or a cliff above the shore or an accident on the street.&quot; The first lines of Fragile Soul/Heavy Heart set the tone for the rest of this strangely calm, reduced and peaceful song that is, after all, about suicide. It is no surprise, then, that Dust Covered Carpet are based in a city with a well-known affinity for all things morbid: Vienna.  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoDibigode \u2013 Mariposa (A Lagartixa E O Urubu)Dibigode is a creative band formed by five young multi-instrumentists who make post-rock music full of melodic lines and dynamic sounds. This version of Mariposa (A Lagartixa E O Urubu) is part of the new remastered version of their debut album, Naturais E Id\u00eanticos Ao Natural De Pimentas Da Jamaica E Preta, available for free download at the band&apos;s website.  CANADA: Quick Before It MeltsEvening Hymns \u2013 ArrowsOn his second album as Evening Hymns, Jonas Bonnetta has made public his very private and personal response to his father&apos;s passing. There are moments of sentimentality and sweetness, and there are times when raw nerves are exposed, stinging with pain and heartache. Arrows is a touching, haunting song about the ghosts that linger long after a loved one has passed away.  CHILE: Super 45Ases Falsos \u2013 La Sinceridad Del CosmosAses Falsos present their debut album, Juventud Americana (Arca Discos), a collection of songs that refer to the Latin American ideology yet manage to sound contemporary at the same time. The classy use of synthesizers, the meticulous vocal harmonies and the melodic wrapping are, along with irony-filled lyrics with a strong political and social meaning, the highlights of this work. Our pick is La Sinceridad Del Cosmos (&quot;The sincerity of the cosmos&quot;), a song that questions police brutality \u2026 from an animal&apos;s point of view.  CHINA: WooozyBaby Formula \u2013 Warm SongBaby Formula, currently the only shoegaze band in Beijing who play dream pop live, are formed by an artist who dedicates himself to being a loser, a senior who doesn&apos;t know where to get a master&apos;s degree and a writer who hasn&apos;t sold any work yet. Their music is influenced by a wide range of bands from Slowdive to The Radio Dept.  COLOMBIA: El Parlante AmarilloBomba Est\u00e9reo \u2013 Pa&apos; RespirarAfter four years of waiting, electro-cumbia group Bomba Est\u00e9reo return with a more reflective album in which they explore their essence, but without forgetting their Caribbean power. Pa&apos; Respirar means &quot;to breathe&quot;, a theme that reflects the band&apos;s new vibe, where you can feel the world they inhabit.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianIndianna Dawn \u2013 I Always Miss YouThere&apos;s been a new wave of Americana and country music sweeping Denmark in the past few years (I say &quot;new&quot; \u2013 I don&apos;t really think there&apos;s ever been one before) and one representative of this is the quintet Indianna Dawn, centered around singer and songwriter Dianna D\u00f8nns. MAP exclusive download I Always Miss You is from their great debut album, Somebody&apos;s Dead.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: La CaseteraDuluc \u2013 La Mano Part\u00edaFrom the depths of rural laments, La Casetera&apos;s first MAP submission is all about Dominican folklore. Jos\u00e9 Duluc is part of our musical history, playing alongside iconic rock star Luis &quot;Terror&quot; D\u00edas for many years. His nostalgic approach to peasant work on his latest song, La Mano Part\u00eda, makes us contemplate the aspirations of the less fortunate and their longing to be generously rewarded someday.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogWoodpecker Wooliams \u2013 CrowWoodpecker Wooliams, aka Brighton girl Gemma Williams, is a 27-year-old singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, and for once that term is true: the former midwife plays harp, kora, omnichord, keyboard, harmonium, electric organ, accordion, penny whistle, clarinet, bells, glockenspiel, electric shruti box, recorder and drums. She&apos;s also more Bj\u00f6rk than Beyonc\u00e9, a kookstress with a high chirrup of a voice and a backstory involving a bird obsession and a bee fetish. Don&apos;t expect wall-to-wall cute, though. On Crow, one of several avian-related titles on her The Bird School of Being Human album, she sings about building &quot;a great funeral pyre&quot; as the music becomes increasingly clanging and industrial. Prepare to be haunted long after it ends.  FINLAND: GlueSkip Zone \u2013 Leaving Planet BoredomSkip Zone are a six-piece folk-rock band from Helsinki that perform mid-tempo cosmic Americana songs with some outstanding vocal harmonies and catchy pop melodies. A little bit early Wilco here and a little bit Ryan Adams there makes for well-crafted songs. Skip Zone&apos;s debut EP can be heard on SoundCloud in its entirety.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredAud \u2013 VioletsAud is a folk-pop duet hailing from Nancy, heavily influenced by Patrick Watson, Sufjan Stevens, Beirut and other indie acts. Their first EP, Origami, released in 2010, brought them much success, and Violets is taken from their second one, The Death of the Stag God, released on 14 September. Not only are they brilliant lyricists, they&apos;re also exceptional musicians, who use guitars, drums, pianos, glockenspiel and harmonica to create a diverse spectrum of sounds and feelings.  GERMANY: BlogparteiStabil Elite \u2013 HydravionLet&apos;s conclude our series on new Kraut with this fine trio from Duesseldorf, whose debut Douze Pouze had quite an impact on German music scene. They combine the charm of monotony and repetitive patterns with distinctive lyrics reminiscent of Neue Deutsche Welle. But Stabil Elite is not just one of those retro bands \u2013 it&apos;s mature, handmade music with great range and originality.  ICELAND: Rj\u00f3minnMonotown \u2013 Can DenyMonotown just finished their debut album in a collaboration with four-time Grammy-winning mixing engineer Michael Brauer. While the album&apos;s narrative may have roots in their motherland, its sound will be equal parts American western film score and Beatles psychedelia, flavored with haunting textures reminiscent of contemporary indie-rock bands.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarBrilliant At Breakfast \u2013 Gundala Putra PetirBrilliant at Breakfast are one of this country&apos;s finest indie-pop/twee-pop bands. Hailing from Yogyakarta, they already enjoy a global reach, distributing their records around the world via Apple Crumble (Japan), Hands and Arms (France), Susy Records and many more. Enjoy their heartfelt tune Gundala Putra Petir.  IRELAND: Nialler9Forrests \u2013 TarifaThe duo of Paul O&apos;Reilly and Owen O&apos;Mahony only have two Forrests tracks available online but form from their other band, Channel One, and a couple of super live shows have confirmed them as a vital prospect. Their music reaches for the night sky, a la M83 or Fuck Buttons, with a crisp digital sheen and warm breaths. Tarifa is a beauty.  ITALY: PolaroidGo Dugong \u2013 White Sun (feat. Welcome Back Sailors)Listening to this song in September may be painful: the level of nostalgia for the summer that just faded away (at least on this side of the globe) can become dangerously high. In any case, the music Go Dugong makes is so good it&apos;s worth it \u2013 sunny synths, samples lost in the echoes and lots of beats. Go Dugong is the solo project of Giulio Fonseca (from the brilliant band K\u00f8benhavn Store) and he just released his first EP on the Czech label AMDISCS.  JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesFancy Books \u2013 Sister Carry StarsSaitama duo Fancy Books takes a lot of cues from groups currently generating buzz in Tokyo, especially blog-approved outfits Jesse Ruins and Sapphire Slows, whose sounds swirl dance music with unsettling ambient touches. Sister Carry Stars, though, leans closer to pop, with a jaunty melody and sweet vocals that sound inviting. Still, Fancy Books take an otherwise summer-friendly number and turn it woozy with their synths.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaTollens \u2013 Beautiful DayTollens (real name Ryan Formosa) bought his first guitar at age 13, but it was only recently that he started recording proper songs. He came up with the name as a nod to Bernhard Tollens, the German chemist. After unleashing his first EP on SoundCloud to good feedback from friends and even people he&apos;d never met, he decided to take it further. Beautiful Day is taken from the EP Drowning in a Dream \u2013 a proverbial bedroom-pop rollercoaster, available as a free download from Bandcamp.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaEddie Mercury \u2013 In MexicoMexico&apos;s National Day falls on 15 September, and to set the mood for a party we&apos;ve brought in local Electrique Music genius Eddie Mercury. On this eight-minute bouncing trance, a digitally bloated voice emphasises he wasn&apos;t born in New York, Chicago or Detroit\u2013 he was born &quot;In Mexico&quot;. So let&apos;s dress in red, white and green and insanely dance to this new national (house) anthem.  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!Spilt Milk \u2013 Our Despised DecayDuring the dark days of December 2011, Amsterdam-based quintet Spilt Milk found comfort in the first eight published poems by American modernist poet Wallace Stevens (1879-1955). Gathered under the title Carnet De Voyage (&quot;Travel Notebook&quot;), these songs are full of stars, sunsets, landscapes and rivers. Although Stevens&apos;s poetry may not be the easiest or permeable, listening to Spilt Milk&apos;s drone-folk adaptations makes entering his Buddhist-like, abstract view of the world a rewarding experience.  PERU: SoTBThe Cocainers \u2013 Let&apos;s DanceAlthough The Cocainers&apos; career is very new - they formed only five months ago in Lima - it looks very promising. They are in the process of making their first album, but already we can find songs at the level of Let&apos;s Dance. With its old school rock, vibrating vocals, electro touches and an inherent indie flavor, it&apos;s a powerful song which will make your muscles move without you noticing.  POLAND: \u0141ukasz Ku\u015bmierz WeblogMuzyka Ko\u0144ca Lata \u2013 Dok\u0105dOK, so this track might be from 2011 and the name of the band means &quot;music of the end of the summer&quot;, but Dok\u0105d is earning international fame, having been voted Song of the Summer 2012 in a contest run by popular Seattle-based podcast Too Beautiful To Live. Muzyka Ko\u0144ca Lata is influenced by bigbit - a popular genre in Poland in the 60s - and you can check out the beautiful lyrics of Dok\u0105d here.   PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Minta &amp; The Brook Trout \u2013 FalconMinta &amp; The Brook Trout are one of the most interesting Portuguese bands around. They were first in MAP in December 2010; Now they are back with their new album, Olympia, out on September 17. To celebrate the release, here&apos;s the first single, Falcon.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieDandy And The Walkers \u2013 Video HoOut of the blue, Dandy And The Walkers broke into the Puerto Rican independent scene late this summer with this single, Video Ho. A shared love of The Shirleys and The Ronettes brought Michelle Fern\u00e1ndez, Melissa Collazo and Enrique Olivares together, while their sonic exploration led them to recruit Laira D\u00edaz, C\u00e9sar Jim\u00e9nez and Juanto Arrroyo. Mario Negr\u00f3n (of psych-rockers, Fantasmes) got them to record at Casa Fantasmes, producing this track which showcases the raw talent and contagiously fun vibe the ensemble is able to create. Dandy And The Walkers are currently recording their first album.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoisePopa Sapka \u2013 Stinky BastardsThe music of Popa Sapka, heavily influenced by Balkanic melodies and rhythms, is a mix of ska, pop, punk, gypsy, reggae, folk and the traditional music of &apos;mother Russia&apos;. Their lyrics, originating from the band&apos;s multicultural background, present a twisted mix of English, Russian, Romanian and Gagauzian languages. The light-heartedness and sincerity of their songs are what makes Popa Sapka so appealing.  RUSSIA: Big EchoFPRF \u2013 Crystallization PointNovosibirsk-based shoegaze band FPRF prepares for its next full-length release with Crystallization Point, a calm and beautiful slow-burning jam backed with remixes by beats producer Ta-ku and future garage from Nocow.  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopSiobhan Wilson \u2013 All Dressed UpSiobhan Wilson&apos;s music pursuits have taken the 24-year-old from her native Scotland to a surprise pop career in France, back to Scotland and now London, where she finds herself charming all-comers with her folky, jazzy bilingual storytelling and cartoon-like glamour. Unrequited love is the dish of the day in All Dressed Up, the captivating standout track of her just-released mini-album Glorified Demons.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To...FAUXE \u2013 Be My LoveA mysterious force has been brewing in Singapore, bubbling beneath the shiny veneer of saturated city lights. The glitchy imperfections of static haunt the corridors of abandoned buildings, a sign of life from androids realising self-awareness. FAUXE leads a charge into this unknown realm, stirring up quite the storm with his debut EP Ubuntu and letting his music trickle down your window panes on a rain-sodden day.  SOUTH AFRICA: Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Al Bairre \u2013 Youth De FreitasSymphonic indie-rock band Al Bairre was formed at the begining of 2011, drawing influences from bands such as Arcade Fire, Ra Ra Riot, Vampire Weekend and Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros. The five-piece have seemingly perfected the indie-dance genre, combining cello, violin, keys, Fender guitars and ukulele to produce an exciting sound that has seen them scale the local scene.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean IndieBig Baby Driver \u2013 My GoodbyeAfter many years of crafting lovely music, singer-songwriter Big Baby Driver recently rose to fame after having a few songs featured in Korean television drama series A Gentleman&apos;s Dignity. Last month she released a collaboration single with former MAP artist Kim Mokin. My Goodbye, with its bossa rhythms, is Big Baby Driver&apos;s contribution to the release.  SPAIN: MusikornerNaturalesa Salvatge \u2013 Sota L&apos;aiguaNaturalesa Salvatge are a five-piece from Barcelona who make melancholic but dreamy melodies. Their main influences are The Smiths, Teenage Fanclub and The Radio Dept. Formed during a national lo-fi explosion, Naturalesa Salvatge have shown they&apos;re not as ephemeral as similar acts, most of them now defunct.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaCaviare Days \u2013 You&apos;ll QualifySwedish sisters Lina and Maja Westin formed Caviare Days in New York, which isn&apos;t at all surprising since one could easily compare them to a couple of other female-fronted garage bands linked to the city&apos;s scene. This is a good thing, of course. Their 60s-inspired psychedelic rock is as refreshing as it is really, really good. The duo&apos;s self-titled debut LP is out now in Sweden and will be released in North America on October 9.  SWITZERLAND: 78sFai Baba \u2013 Peach Orchard MamaThe first time Fai Baba was on a stage he had just come back from a spiritual journey through India. Then he picked up his guitar, wrote a few songs and played his ass off in cellars, whisky bars and squatted houses. His psychedelic blues-rock is best enjoyed during live shows, they tend to get ecstatic. His debut album Snake Snake was released in August.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATOn Your Horizon \u2013 Untitled #1On Your Horizon is a four-piece experimental post-rock gathering from Eskisehir and Istanbul. Their album Home is a DIY production released for free in 2010 via Bandcamp. Having made a tremendous impact, the band&apos;s self-confident has increased and their new track Untitled #1 is an ironclad song which builds splendidly.  UNITED STATES: We Listen For YouSeamonster \u2013 Normandy LandscapeThe music of Seamonster is a slow-moving invasion of simple yet powerful movements of sonic exploration that ultimately transports the listener to another world. Every layer upon layer reveals itself slowly until every instrument is swirling and floating above. Melt into this track, let itself wrap around you and take over.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sHolySexyBastards \u2013 Getting Over YouWhen we decided to include HolySexyBastards in this month&apos;s MAP, they were just another competitor in Festival Nuevas Bandas, one of the biggest new music festivals in Venezuela. Today, this power trio formed in Valencia are the winners (along with Okills, who were on MAP in January 2012). HolySexyBastards offer us the track Getting Over You, included on their self-titled album released in May.", "sentences": ["NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!Spilt Milk \u2013 Our Despised DecayDuring the dark days of December 2011, Amsterdam-based quintet Spilt Milk found comfort in the first eight published poems by American modernist poet Wallace Stevens (1879-1955)."], "title": "September's best music from across the MAP", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/sep/17/music-alliance-pact-september", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Electronic music"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-17T20:00:00Z", "article": "Neither Louise nor Martine Fokkens fit the stereotype of a window prostitute in Amsterdam.

I travel to meet the twins and to be given a guided tour around the legalised sex industry that attracts thousands of British sex tourists every\u00a0year. The sisters dress and speak identically, and, to complicate matters, often talk over each other, in a way that is almost impossible to understand. They seem to speak in\u00a0a\u00a0kind of code. But they are warm\u00a0and eager to talk to me. &quot;I was beaten on to the streets by my husband in my early 20s,&quot; Louise tells me when we meet in a tapas bar on Warmoesstraat, in the heart of the red-light area. &quot;He told me unless I earned money for him he would leave me, and I had children and loved him,\u00a0so I had to do it.&quot; Louise has three children, and some\u00a0or all have been in and out of foster care. It is difficult to get the exact story because Martine, who has four children, interjects with tales of losing her own offspring and the heartache that ensued. It could be that\u00a0one tells the story for both, or they tell each other. But both have encountered violence, abuse and exploitation, and\u00a0their early years in prostitution were hard. &quot;We kept each\u00a0other company,&quot; says Louise. &quot;But Martine needs to carry on because there is not much money around.&quot; Louise, who left prostitution two years ago due to arthritis (&quot;I could not\u00a0do sexual positions&quot;) tells me how\u00a0things have changed for the worse\u00a0since she entered the sex trade. &quot;There are few Dutch women and no sense of community these days,&quot; she says. The legalisation of brothels in 2000 has not improved prostitutes&apos; lives, in Martine&apos;s opinion. &quot;There is no point working just for tax. That is why the girls are working from the internet and from home \u2013 you are less\u00a0likely to be spotted by the taxman.\u00a0The whole family used to live off your earnings and now the tax\u00a0office comes up with crazy amounts you have to pay. It is better for the pimps and the foreigners, but not the Dutch girls. The vultures came in 2000. Organised criminals. They thought, ahah, it is legalised. Now we are OK.&quot; When Louise began working, Martine was in hospital having her first child. &quot;My mother came in and said, &quot;You know Louise is [in prostitution]. I\u00a0was in shock. I wanted to help her.&quot; &quot;Later on they needed a cleaner in the brothel and Martine took the job and the men asked her for business,&quot; says Louise. &quot;So we started doing threesomes, and that was how we ended up working in the same house [window brothel] together.&quot; The relatively rosy picture the twins paint of prostitution is perhaps because they have always looked after each other and, unlike the majority of other women, even saw punters together. Born into an ordinary\u00a0middle class family with seven children in total, the twins enjoyed a happy childhood. But it all changed when Louise married a violent\u00a0and controlling man. Did Louise find the work easier with\u00a0Martine by her side? &quot;Oh yes,&quot; they say in unison. &quot;We are always together. We do everything\u00a0together.&quot; The sisters live on the outskirts of\u00a0Amsterdam and Martine still commutes into the city three days a week. I ask how busy she is. &quot;Yes, yes, so-so,&quot; she says. &quot;My regulars want to know they will get a good service.&quot; It is almost impossible to get a sense of whether the twins regret their lives in prostitution underneath the joie-de-vivre attitude both have adopted. The only time they both stop laughing and teasing each other is when Louise tells me about the shame she brought on her family when caught soliciting on the streets. &quot;Our mother drove down to the canal where we were working on the street and shouted: &apos;I see you! Your father is coming.&apos; She hit me. I was very embarrassed for my parents.&quot; I ask if she saved during her working years. &quot;I have \u20ac5 in my purse,&quot; she says. &quot;Whores are expected to do things for nothing.&quot; Unsure of what she means, I ask why the sisters do not charge for posing for photographs with the endless stream of men who approach them. &quot;That would not be right,&quot; is Louise&apos;s response. The sisters obviously relish their fame, and glow with pride when they are recognised by the public. I have a sense that they are viewed as celebrity oddities, and that the men will show the photos around for a laugh, although with prostitution being so public and normalised in Amsterdam, it&apos;s hard to tell. In front of the Oude Kerk (Old Church) on Oudekerksplein we come to a bronze statue in honour of &quot;sex workers around the world&quot;, titled Belle. The sisters are asked by a group of labourers to pose with them. Martine says she has no retirement date in mind, and Louise interjects with: &quot;She has no money to retire yet.&quot; The image captured on camera, of two happy old women, seemingly without a care in the world, belies the abuse and social exclusion endured throughout two extraordinary lifetimes.

The multiple Oscar-winner, who brought mega movie hits including The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Titanic and Avatar to the big screen, is in the vanguard of 3D research and development most recently in sports with plans to shoot the biannual Ryder Cup in 3D and via his recent deep-sea exploration work in the seven-mile-deep Mariana Trench. He is also about to start shooting the next instalment of Avatar, which will of course be in 3D. The 62-year-old Canadian is best known as a director \u2013 he holds the record for the top two highest-grossing films ever with Avatar and Titanic \u2013 but he is also a crusading evangelist for 3D; he is part-owner and co-chairman of the Cameron Pace Group (CPG), a company that builds 3D rigs and 3D cameras both for Cameron&apos;s own productions as well as for a host of different broadcasters including National Geographic and ESPN. CPG recently created a China-based subsidiary to bring its expertise in 3D filming and production to one of the fastest-growing 3D markets in the world. &quot;All things are better in 3D,&quot; enthused Cameron backstage after a presentation about his dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench delivered at the IBC broadcast technology exhibition in Amsterdam. Navigating to the ocean&apos;s floor in a specially designed submersible built over seven years, Cameron filmed in 3D with nano-cameras developed by CPG that can be held in the palm of your hand and are able to withstand pressures of 16,000 psi at 36,000ft underwater. &quot;What&apos;s the point of setting the world&apos;s depth record if you don&apos;t shoot it in 3D?!&quot; quipped Cameron. In addition to being a film director and technology pioneer Cameron is also a keen adventurer and is a National Geographic explorer in residence. This month CPG will work for the first time with the UK pay TV operator BSkyB on the Ryder Cup, using 26 3D cameras for the bi-annual event this year staged in Chicago. This follows CPG partnering with ESPN on the Aspen, Co.-staged X Games over a number of years. &quot;Symbolically the deal with BSkyB shows that we are a go-to partner for Europe as well as in America and the idea is to get close to Sky in the UK and also to Sky in Germany and Italy as they roll out 3D,&quot; said Cameron. Cameron&apos;s allegiance to 3D is unswerving and he believes this style of filming will only increase in popularity among broadcasters because the modern 3D cameras can simultaneously broadcast a 2D feed, if necessary, and also the issue of viewers having to wear cumbersome glasses is close to being resolved. In fact at IBC there were prototypes of glasses-free 3D screens \u2013 TVs, smart phones and tablets \u2013 developed by Dolby Laboratories and Royal Philips Electronics that drew crowds. &quot;What will cause a breakthrough is the move to TV sets and other devices where you don&apos;t need to wear the glasses,&quot; said Cameron. &quot;That will cause the (adoption) curve to elbow up.&quot; Cameron also has a more personal agenda. &quot;Even a 3D movie like Avatar which is made for the cinema will enjoy the greater part of its lifespan on video seen on the home TV screen,&quot; said Cameron. &quot;We can&apos;t make movies in 3D fast enough to justify the wide adoption of 3D TVs so in my enlightened self-interest as a film-maker I want to see the broadcaster market expand rapidly so everyone is watching in 3D.&quot; Cameron believes that TV shows like CSI and Game of Thrones and other glossy TV dramas should all be shot in 3D. The idea is that the more programming there is in 3D, the more incentive there is for the consumer electronics companies to make 3D sets and other devices. &quot;It&apos;s a positive feedback loop,&quot; he explained. To support his 3D commitment, Cameron is working on three follow-up Avatar movies, all in 3D, of course. In fact, Avatar 2 is set to start shooting this autumn and could be in cinemas by 2015 and yes, Sigourney Weaver, who played the chain-smoking scientist who died at the end of the original Avatar, will be back for Avatar 2. According to Cameron, one of the biggest problems with getting TV productions shot in 3D is the higher cost, but he says that although 3D shoots can be 20% to 30% higher on a single-programme shoot, that for a bigger, multiple-episode TV series these costs fall to only 2% to 3% more than a standard 2D shoot. &quot;For Avatar there was no additional camera shooting in 3D,&quot; said Cameron. &quot;Most of Avatar was one camera or two cameras if we were blowing something up. But most of it was one camera handheld on my shoulder or on a dolly or a steady cam. And that is basically the same way a scripted series is shot: two shots, two overs, two close ups and then you move on.&quot; Cameron calls TV drama series the &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; for 3D development. &quot;Where you get into big additional costs in 3D is when you add the visual effects,&quot; said Cameron citing Martin Scorsese&apos;s 3D kids fantasy Hugo and Ang Lee&apos;s forthcoming Life of Pi, both of which have lots of computer-generated images or CGI. China is one market where Cameron sees very big 3D potential. CPG has recently opened a China branch for both 3D cinema and TV productions. He says the China business will likely double the size of CPG over the next year because there is such huge demand there, with a new 3D screen cinema opening almost one a day. &quot;China is adding new TV channels in 3D every day. They want to take 3D to scale as rapidly as we can do it. We&apos;ve been working to be able to do hundreds of hours of 3D at CPG but now we are working to be able to do 6,000 to 7,000 hours of 3DTV because of China.&quot; In China, Avatar, Titanic and Transformers \u2013 all in 3D \u2013 are the three highest-grossing titles, said Cameron. &quot;The Chinese audience loves 3D. They see it as a premium brand and they are very brand conscious now as they flex their economic muscle.&quot; Kate Bulkley is a journalist and media commentator.

The Portuguese has vowed to &quot;embrace the Europa League as if it were the Champions League&quot; and that ambition will be reflected in the strong side he will deploy as Spurs begin their campaign at home to Lazio on Thursday night. Villas-Boas&apos;s predecessor, Harry Redknapp, made a token attempt to win this tournament last season, scattering fringe players throughout his line-ups as he chose to preserve most of his primary resources for the Premier League; Spurs&apos; elimination in last season&apos;s group stage almost seemed a relief to then-manager.

The hot device on the stands for the 50,000 television executives at this month&apos;s IBC broadcasting technology get-together in Amsterdam was the connected TV, but the true trendsetters were discussing connecting everything. That is, not just syncing your laptop or your mobile to your favourite TV programme, but how to create a new eco-system of connectivity that will involve most of the electronic devices in the home, including the fridge. Among those thinking this was the new executive vice-president of global media for Samsung Electronics, David Eun, who gave his first official appearance in his new role at IBC where he fleshed out an all-embracing vision with, of course, Samsung devices at its heart. As the head of the new global media group and an adviser to the president of Samsung&apos;s mobile group, Eun is a leader in the concept of creating a new means of electronic distribution that encompasses more than just the obvious communication devices. Currently, the hype is about all the entertainment screens (such smartphones and laptops and, increasingly, televisions) being connected to the internet, but Eun sees a bigger picture \u2013 all of those devices and more being connected to the internet and to each other. Samsung is not the only consumer electronics firm to be thinking beyond hardware \u2013 LG and Sony have also launched smart TVs loaded with apps as well. But Eun is well-placed to have this kind of a strategic vision because Samsung sells a lot of screens: it has been the leading seller of TVs for seven years now, which is more than Sony, and in the US Samsung sells more each year than its next three competitors combined. The company has also more recently become a powerhouse in mobile phones, outselling Apple&apos;s iPhone for several quarters, which has only added to the acrimony between the two companies over patent disputes, especially since the recent US court decision this summer that went against Samsung, awarding Apple $1bn in damages. Samsung&apos;s latest smartphone, the Galaxy 3S, shipped 20m in its first 100 days, while Apple&apos;s new iPhone 5 sold out online two days after its 12 September launch. Eun won&apos;t discuss the patent suit, saying that he sees his job to build on Samsung&apos;s device distribution prowess. &quot;All these screens are connected to the internet but they are not yet all connected to each other,&quot; he said. &quot;Once we connect all these devices to each other we will effectively have one of the world&apos;s largest platforms for distribution content, services and advertising.&quot; The question is can Samsung create an &quot;ecosystem&quot; of software, hardware, services and customer support with the same kind of success as Apple? According to David Mercer, vice-president of digital consumer practice at Strategy Analytics, Samsung has not yet proven that purchasers of its TVs will also remain loyal to the brand enough to also purchase a Samsung tablet and mobile phone. &quot;The different branches of the company need to work better together in consumers&apos; minds,&quot; said Mercer. Eun, a 45-year-old Korean-American and a former executive at AOL, Google and NBC, was employed by Samsung only in January, but has since begun to set out his stall to help take the South Korean electronics giant in a new strategic direction in terms of its future focus. Of course, Samsung will continue to manufacture and innovate its hardware products \u2013 it spent $9bn on R&amp;D last year alone \u2013 but he is also thinking about the company&apos;s software developments and he&apos;s been meeting with companies and creatives around the world to match up relevant content and services that can be tapped into via the company&apos;s own device network. He is also talking about making some strategic investments in companies with services or software that will help build up the appeal of Samsung devices. He said he spends as much time in New York and Silicon Valley as we does in Korea and clearly with the trip to Amsterdam he is looking at Europe as well for both partnerships and acquisitions to build on the approximately 2,000 apps that Samsung already has on its &quot;Smart Hub&quot; on its connected TVs. &quot;Samsung hasn&apos;t had to do lots of acquisitions historically because of its scale and share of talent,&quot; Eun said. &quot;But acquiring other companies is a way for us to accelerate our entry into the content services space.&quot; Eun talks a lot about the &quot;power of the distribution network&quot;, ie the ability to sell lots of devices quickly. One reason for this is that Samsung has embraced a more &quot;open&quot; ecosystem than Apple in terms of its approach to payment and content, using both Google&apos;s Android and Microsoft&apos;s Windows 8 as well as a new alliance with Intel called Tizen, which is an HTML 5-based platform for apps. &quot;At Samsung I have understood the importance of distribution and the importance of proximity to the user,&quot; said Eun. &quot;One the things that has blown me away about the opportunity is that Samsung creates more devices \u2013 and so we have more touch points with consumers \u2013 than virtually any other company on the planet.&quot; And for Eun it&apos;s not just the usual TV and phone suspects he is talking about, but other white goods products like refrigerators and windows, which Samsung also makes. &quot;We already have windows that are also displays and they have virtual shades,&quot; explained Eun. &quot;There is a world, and it is not far away, where the mirror above the sink in the bathroom is a display and is connected to all the other devices that we make.&quot; Eun says that he already can see the day when his young kids say to him: &quot;Daddy do you really mean you used paper and magnets on the refrigerator to communicate with Mom? Why didn&apos;t you just put a screen there?&quot; With his background in Silicon Valley, Eun is also keen to see the TV set evolve into a more easily updateable device and he spoke at IBC about Samsung&apos;s development of an &quot;evolution kit&quot; for that will be used to upgrade TVs already in the market to move them more to the kind of replacement cycle more typical of smart phones, laptops and tablets. &quot;Our TV sets are increasingly modular,&quot; said Eun. Samsung may be thinking outside of the box about connectivity ideas for the near future, but the company is certainly not alone. The demand for smart technology devices is increasing almost exponentially \u2013 the demand for connected devices is booming, while second-screen app providers like Shazam and Zeebox are causing a stir in terms of pushing the current boundaries of connected and socialized content. &quot;Regardless of where you start now \u2013 on the content or on the hardware side \u2013 you need to understand both,&quot; said Eun. &quot;There is no silver bullet but there are important paths to pursue and that&apos;s what we are doing.&quot; Kate Bulkley is a journalist and media commentator.

The acquisition marks the latest battle for digital advertising supremacy between arch rivals Levy, the chairman and chief executive of Publicis Groupe, and WPP chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell. Just three months ago, WPP acquired a majority stake in AKQA, one of the world&apos;s biggest and most well-known digital ad agencies, in a $540m (\u00a3332m) deal. Amsterdam-listed LBi reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) of \u20ac19.9m for the first half of 2012, implying that Publicis Groupe has paid a multiple of about 10.5 times profits. Sorrell paid a multiple of about 12.8 times ebitda for AKQA. Publicis said the offer for LBi, which has so far been accepted by investors controlling 67% of stock, was a 39.8% premium on its share price before speculation of a sale emerged in June. &quot;The acquisition of LBi is another step forward in further strengthening our digital operations,&quot; said Levy, adding that the deal would mean that more than 35% of Publicis Groupe&apos;s total revenues will now come from digital operations. UBS advised Publics Groupe on the deal, while LBi was advised by Jefferies. LBi was prompted to put out a statement to the stock market admitting it was in talks with interested parties, of which Publicis was considered by observers to be the most likely buyer, days after Sorrell acquired AKQA in June. Levy has been on something of a digital buying spree in recent years. In 2006, Publicis spent $1.3bn on Digitas and in 2010 paid Microsoft $530m for the Razorfish ad agency network. Last May, Levy paid $575m (\u00a3502m) for Rosetta, which claimed to be the second-largest digital marketing company in the US. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Is it dangerous to ride along a disused railway line in the Peak District? No. Is it too dangerous to ride down the Euston Road at rush hour? Not for me, but I&apos;ve ridden a bike most days of my adult life. I found the report this week about the rise in &quot;cycle deaths&quot; in 2012 very upsetting. But the news emboldens me to cycle more, and encourage others to do the same, rather than lock my bikes away in the shed and drive a car. Two years ago I was in Portland, Oregon, where a quiet cycling revolution is under way. There are now more transport journeys by bicycle per capita in Portland than in any other large American city. A journalist there told me that a turning point in the safety of cyclists on the roads comes when everyone who drives knows someone who cycles: it could be your neighbour&apos;s daughter or a work colleague on that bike, which influences how you drive. We&apos;re a long way from that point in the UK, but the more people that cycle, the closer we get, and the more legitimate the campaign for safer cycling becomes. Gerhard Weiss, development officer at the London Cycling Campaign We certainly should not take news about people being killed while cycling as a reason not to ride a bike. But the hazards that cyclists are exposed to and that put people off cycling in the first place are real. Statistically you should be absolutely fine on Euston Road. But what the statistics hide is the impact even a minor collision has on people who are not encased in a metal box. It can easily cause life-changing injury without ending up as a statistic. Even a near miss or just the sheer aggression one might experience on our streets is clearly enough for too many people to give up cycling or to cycle less than they would like to. I disagree with the notion that everything is fine and people who are not cycling because they are too scared of motor traffic are either making it up or should just get on with it. There is huge capacity to improve our streets, not just for cycling but for everyone, by making them better for cycling. This will involve behaviour-change measures, but the way we design our streets has a big role to play and would also affect behaviour. We cannot accept conditions as they are. RP Don&apos;t forget, it&apos;s also dangerous to drive a car, and be a pedestrian. Part of the problem in the UK is that pro-cycling advocates compare our plight to the promised land \u2013 the two-wheel tranquillity of Copenhagen or Amsterdam. Our situation is very different: we&apos;re densely populated and space on our roads is heavily contested. Also the bicycle was overlooked in transport and planning policy for half a century. Yet I just don&apos;t think the situation across the UK is that bad. I&apos;ve ridden a bike in over 40 countries. Cycling across Delhi or Jakarta or Tehran \u2013 now that is terrifying. Cycling across London is not. Granted, the status quo is not acceptable. We have to keep pressing for better infrastructure, greater motorist awareness of cyclists and institutional acceptance of the bicycle as a valid form of transportation. But my concern is that by making all the noise about the dangers of cycling in the UK, that noise discourages people from cycling rather than reducing the danger itself. &quot;The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,&quot; as President Roosevelt said. Would it be better to shout about the pleasures and benefits of cycling, and work to improve cycling safety sotto voce? GW Yearning for the promised land is perhaps part of human nature. But cycle provision in the Netherlands or Copenhagen has a much more practical, down-to-earth appeal. Cycling is a key element in transport planning and feeling safe, an element of carefreeness akin to using public transport, is part of it. It means everyone is empowered to choose cycling, the hurdles are taken away. I agree that space on our streets is often heavily contested, but that&apos;s not dissimilar to Amsterdam. And you hit the nail on the head that the bicycle was for too long the UK&apos;s forgotten mode of transport. It was of course a mistake that has to be rectified, which will take a lot of work. I&apos;m afraid arguing that all is fine in the UK because there are places in the world where cycling is really dangerous just won&apos;t do. We have a duty to shout about street designs that cause danger to people on bikes. Whilst a junction itself, being inanimate, is not dangerous, it is often designed in a way that encourages dangerous behaviour. Unfortunately the media is sometimes too happy to just run with the simplistic &quot;cycling is dangerous&quot; message. RP I&apos;m not sure the majority of people who use public transport would attest to feeling &quot;carefree&quot;, but changing gear a little here \u2026 When I first commuted in London in the early 90s, the bicycle was a pest. There was an overt sense of cyclists versus motorists on the city streets. Riding a bike could feel like an act of anarchy. In the intervening years, health concerns, transport issues, the\u00a0environment, the price of oil and the profile of cycle sport have driven the bicycle back to the centre of public consciousness in the UK. There is a whisper that we might even be at the dawn of a new golden age of the bicycle. I certainly think so. You and your colleagues should give yourself a pat on the back for being a part of that. Right now, though, we need to keep transmitting a positive message, a message that extols the utilitarian, democratic virtues of the bicycle, a message that encourages people to wheel their steeds out of the garage and into the sunshine. Which brings me back to my first point: if you increase the number of cyclists, it becomes safer to cycle. Various road safety studies in US cities bear this out. The nub, then, is how best to encourage people to ride. Exhorting the dangers of cycling is not the best\u00a0way. GW I would hate to live in a society where we are driven to ride a bicycle because of economic and environmental pressures. Nor would I simply bank on the safety in numbers concept and thereby rely on the brave to pave the way. To me it would be a sign of a truly civilised society when people choose to cycle because it feels like the obvious, safe and convenient choice. For this I think the approach needs to be more multi-faceted and requires positive promotion as well as better and safer street design. Perhaps most importantly bicycle traffic needs to enter our planning at a strategic level. Yes, it is important how we balance the public message. And it would be ridiculous to tell people not to cycle until all streets are super-safe. Many more people could enjoy cycling right\u00a0now. There is no doubt that cycling in London has become much more pleasurable over the last decade. A recent visitor from Vienna was impressed by how courteous drivers are in London, can you imagine! However, improvements are still patchy not just within London but across the UK. A new golden age for the bicycle? Bring it on.", "sentences": ["Part of the problem in the UK is that pro-cycling advocates compare our plight to the promised land \u2013 the two-wheel tranquillity of Copenhagen or Amsterdam.", "I agree that space on our streets is often heavily contested, but that&apos;s not dissimilar to Amsterdam."], "title": "Is it too dangerous to cycle?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/debate-is-cycling-dangerous-penn-weiss", "tags": ["Cycling", "Road safety", "Fitness", "Road transport", "Planning policy"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-22T23:06:00Z", "article": "For me, the measure of personal vanity hangs on whether someone is brave, stupid or desperate enough to have needles (nasty, sharp, bruising needles!) plunged into their face? A friend once had &quot;work&quot; done and said it was akin to paying good money to be stung by a giant steel bee. She didn&apos;t even like the effect \u2013 it was the fashionable &quot;pillow face&quot;, popularised by celebrities who think it makes their faces look discreetly plumper, collagen-enriched, younger \u2013 but usually just makes them look pillow-faced. This is the great con. The aim is &quot;youthful&quot; and &quot;natural&quot;, but often all you end up representing is the derma filler. You become Restylane Girl. Perlane Lady. A walking billboard for procedures that other people are still deciding whether they&apos;re brave, stupid or desperate enough to undergo. &quot;Does that look good on her \u2013 good enough for me to want a needle stuck in my face?&quot; And some might say, oh blah, what&apos;s new, it is what it is. Except of course when it isn&apos;t. Baaps (the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons) reckons that injectable fillers could be the next big cosmetic surgery scandal, to rival PIP, where 50,000 British women were given breast implants made of industrial-grade, rather than medical-grade, silicone. Baaps is not the first to point out that fillers in the UK are completely unregulated: fillers, some of which are banned in the States, are being bought straight from the internet. Barely trained practitioners are operating from high street beauty salons, hairdressers and manicurists. People are injecting themselves in their own bathrooms. Baaps believes that fillers should be classified as a drug (agreed) and only administered by a doctor. Hmm. A cynic might ask: why only doctors and not, say, qualified nurses who, after all, perform the majority of injections? One is also confused by Baaps&apos; concern about the effect advertising has on vulnerable people seeking treatments for &quot;psychological reasons&quot;. Well, aren&apos;t we all? With the exception of burns victims, mastectomy patients and others with specific medical needs, isn&apos;t the entire industry built on &quot;psychological reasons&quot;? More pressingly, something is niggling about this pat comparison with PIP. Yes, in both instances, dire lack of regulation is key, but surely the similarities end there? While issues with fillers mainly rest on people not seeking adequate medical advice, a key factor of PIP was that the victims did everything by the rule book, for all the good it did them. Indeed, one of the most disgraceful aspects of PIP was how, by simply desiring larger breasts, the women were routinely judged to have &quot;brought it on themselves&quot;. In truth, all of the women were assured by professionals that their implants were safe and proceeded in good faith, with the appropriate medical input. What more could they do? Unless someone wanted to judge their initial desire for augmentation, in terms of contributing to their plight, the PIP victims score a resounding blameless nil. It was simply not their fault that they were given implants made of a substance usually reserved for mattress stuffing. If the PIP scandal has any similarities to any looming filler scandal, then it is also markedly different. To lump these women in, even fleetingly, with the sort of reckless souls who think it&apos;s fine to get their faces injected by their hairdresser is farcical. What I would say to the latter group is \u2013 are you barking? Your faces, and long-term general health, have to be worth more than this? What I would say to the PIP victims is, keep demanding treatment and justice, for you have done nothing wrong. What I would say to Baaps is that in PIP, we have a recent scandal where all was done appropriately, with medical supervision and surgical expertise in place, and look what happened? Perhaps you should think twice before reminding people about it. Try not changing for a change, Gaga Lady Gaga has caused controversy by appearing to be not quite so thin. Or, to employ the passive-aggressive hate speak du jour, she is now &quot;curvier&quot;. However, there was some confusion. In some pictures, Gaga looked pretty normal; in others, especially ones taken onstage, she resembled at least three pit-bull terriers with lipstick on. The words &quot;photo&quot; and shop&quot; would spring to mind, but I just can&apos;t believe that any media outlet would doctor photos of Gaga just to make her look ridiculous. What is that you say? Oh I see\u2026 Even more controversially, Gaga smoked a spliff onstage in Amsterdam. Sporting an outfit comprising a cannabis leaf T-shirt, ripped fishnets and a hairstyle straight out of soft rock central casting, Gaga raved about the &quot;wondrous&quot; drug and how smoking it was a &quot;spiritual experience&quot;. Yeah, baby. This is what I&apos;d term a classic case of Fame Fatigue. Gaga has been ultra famous for so long, and in such an exhausting, overdone way \u2013 in the time it takes you to read this, she would have restyled 20 times \u2013 that she is now malfunctioning. Gaga needs to learn to pace herself, like others who stay the course in the international music scene. More than anything, she needs to release herself from the grinding tyranny of endless costume changes. Neil Young hasn&apos;t changed his jeans in about four decades, but he&apos;s revered as a musical great the world over. Compare this to poor Gaga, running around frazzled, trying to think up another &quot;all you can eat buffet&quot; outfit. (Steaks, lobsters \u2013 what&apos;s next, potato salad?) So chill, Gaga, and stop being such a wardrobe whore. If she weren&apos;t so desperate trying to think up her next outfit, then she probably wouldn&apos;t need a crafty joint onstage. King is a shining example, but is this sequel wise? Novelist Stephen King has announced that there&apos;s going to be a sequel to The Shining, entitled Dr Sleep, which features Danny, the psychic kid on the tricycle, all grown up and messing about with vampires. At present, King is one of the very few cool famous people on the planet. A brilliant writer, you barely ever hear from him, and when you do, he&apos;s hollering about how he and other multimillionaires should pay more tax. What a dude \u2013 I like to think of him as the Willy Wonka of horror publishing. As an admirer, I will of course buy Dr Sleep, but I harbour grave concerns. Sequels, especially ones written an entire quarter of a century after the original, have a lot to live up to. Also, as Hollywood types might say: &quot;Vampires are over!&quot; \u2013 they&apos;ve had the blood sucked out of them by the Twilight franchise. More importantly, how is Stephen King proposing to get the now middle-aged Danny on to a tricycle? Isn&apos;t that going to look the slightest bit weird?

Both David Cameron and Vince Cable have called for a new &quot;responsible capitalism&quot;, where banks would invest for the long term. But behind the scenes the Treasury is sabotaging efforts to control one of the most extreme forms of casino capitalism \u2013 &quot;high-frequency trading&quot;. And that tells us a great deal about our ruling elite&apos;s real plans for Britain&apos;s economic future. The past fortnight has seen growing calls for curbs on HFT \u2013 the use of complex computer systems that spot market patterns, buy millions of shares and hold them for micro-seconds before selling them on. Last Thursday, a US Senate committee heard harsh criticisms of these technologies, and the head of the Australian stock exchange denounced some practices as &quot;inherently dangerous&quot;. Meanwhile, MEPs have announced plans to impose severe regulation. The Treasury, however, has been fighting to dilute any reform, claiming that HFT makes markets more efficient. HFT generates huge profits for financiers and stock exchanges, but many blame it for market volatility and crashes. The most recent victim was the American firm, Knight Capital, which almost collapsed last month when a computer malfunction cost it $440m. More serious was the &quot;flash crash&quot; of 2010, when these technologies briefly sent American shares plummeting and threatened market panic. HFT also reveals a deeper problem with the economy of the last few decades: finance&apos;s extreme short-termism, and the funnelling of resources into trading rather than investment and jobs. The coalition government claims to\u00a0be\u00a0worried about this, and commissioned the respected economist John\u00a0Kay to investigate. His report, published in July, was scathing about the City&apos;s myopic culture, and accused it\u00a0of &quot;undermining&quot; support for &quot;innovative, sustainable long-term business performance&quot;. But while the government made polite noises, it has\u00a0shown few signs of listening. So why are our leaders so determined\u00a0to ignore the lessons of 2008? Lobbying from finance is one factor. Some 16 of 31\u00a0members of a &quot;high-level\u00a0stakeholder group&quot; \u2013 one of the two panels advising the Treasury on the\u00a0issue \u2013 have links to\u00a0the HFT industry. But the problem is more deep-rooted. Most of our leaders cannot imagine what\u00a0the British economy might look like\u00a0without a free-wheeling financial sector. Lack of vision afflicts left as well\u00a0as right: within the Labour party, Ed\u00a0Balls is opposing plans that might upset the City. Yet this is not to accuse politicians of bad faith. The choices facing Britain are not easy ones. Britain has had an unbalanced economy for decades, and changing direction will take more than a\u00a0few policy initiatives. Ever since London challenged Amsterdam as the west&apos;s main trading hub in the 17th century, a &quot;merchant&quot;-style capitalism has dominated the centres of power. This encouraged a particular economic outlook \u2013 flexibility and market awareness, but also a preference for short-term profit over long-term domestic investment. London&apos;s economic elites were masters of global networks, but less interested in developing the home economy \u2013 hence the frequent tensions between finance and industry. Merchant\u00a0dominance also helps explain why Britain \u2013 unlike Germany \u2013 has never enjoyed the collaboration between finance, technocratic industrialists and scientists and workers that is so essential for stable growth. This approach seemed plausible when global finance boomed after the 1980s. City profits and easy credit obscured the deep flaws beneath the surface. But with the collapse of that model in 2008, Britain has reached a turning point: it either &quot;resets&quot; its economy or it continues on the old course, and risks social crisis. Some Labour thinkers are pondering major change \u2013 this is what Ed Miliband&apos;s oddly named &quot;predistribution&quot; is all about. But the details remain vague. The Conservatives, on the other hand,\u00a0seem doggedly determined to tread the merchant path \u2013 even if they rarely say so openly. For the Treasury hopes that just as the City remade itself in the 1950s and 1960s as a lightly regulated haven for American &quot;eurodollars&quot;, so London&apos;s financiers can find a new role: as bankers to Beijing. Earlier this year George Osborne outlined this vision in a little-noticed speech. London would be the main western centre for trading the Chinese renminbi, and Britain would become a\u00a0giant casino for Chinese plutocrats, with a little luxury (and defence) industry attached; the new Asian rich, he enthused, would buy &quot;Rolls-Royces made in Sussex, and Bentleys made in Crewe, dressed in Burberry clothes manufactured in Yorkshire&quot;. This is hardly the inclusive, hi-tech, green economy that we need. It is clear, then, that the Treasury still\u00a0sees finance as the crucial dynamo of the economy. And that is why it is fighting tooth and nail to stop City regulation. The consequences are deeply worrying. The strategy will generate high incomes for a few, not decent living standards for the many. London will become an ever more blingy\u00a0city state with a southeastern hinterland, attached to an impoverished north and west. A disaffected Scotland may leave. We could also see more of last year&apos;s riots, so reminiscent of the urban unrest that afflicted the mercantile London of the 18th century. London cannot be both a merchant city state and the capital of a nation state. Our elites have to make a choice \u2013 they can either respond with split-second speed to the signals of the global markets. Or they can represent the interests of the population that they claim to serve. The British people will\u00a0put up with a lot, but their\u00a0patience\u00a0is not infinite.", "sentences": ["Ever since London challenged Amsterdam as the west&apos;s main trading hub in the 17th century, a &quot;merchant&quot;-style capitalism has dominated the centres of power."], "title": "Whatever happened to responsible capitalism? | David Priestland", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/high-frequency-trading-city-of-london", "tags": ["Banking", "Financial sector", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Business", "Financial crisis", "Economics", "Lehman Brothers"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-26T07:00:15Z", "article": "Modern pop is built on the denial of time. Reunions extend into the distance; the way we now listen to music means that songs from the distant past constantly jostle with songs from the present. With the increasing number of pop veterans, there is an inevitable fondness for nipping and tucking away the signs of their advancing years and inviting audiences into a huge suspension of disbelief \u2013 for a moment it can once more be 1956, or 1967, or 1989 \u2026 Now and again, though, an occasion arrives that decisively reminds us how old post-Elvis popular culture now is \u2013 5 October is the 50th birthday of the Beatles&apos; first single, released back when Harold Macmillan was the PM, and the Cuban missile crisis was only weeks away. &quot;Love Me Do&quot; sounds like the world in which it was made: tentative, still feeling the pinch of post-war austerity. Ian MacDonald&apos;s wonderful song-by-song history of the group, Revolution in the Head, reckoned that the song&apos;s &quot;modal gauntness&quot; is subtly cunning, serving notice of the Beatles&apos; &quot;unvarnished honesty&quot;, and \u2013 via John Lennon&apos;s wailing harmonica part \u2013 the &quot;blunt vitality&quot; of their native Liverpool. In the surviving Beatles&apos; own account, the huge Anthology, Paul McCartney recalls that the song was meant to sound hard and authentic: &quot;blues&quot; rather than &quot;la de da de la&quot;. Many Beatles books barely mention &quot;Love Me Do&quot; at all. But there it is: a number 17 hit, long rumoured to have been propelled into the charts thanks to bulk-buying by manager Brian Epstein. If, like me, one of your first experiences of Beatles music was the collection 1962-66 (known as &quot;The Red Album&quot;, as against 1967-70 &quot;The Blue Album&quot;), you will probably have experienced it as a strangely muted opening to a listening experience that quickly flared into spectacular life: a prologue, rather than a first chapter proper.     Beatles, The Beatles Anthology    The Beatles&apos; second single, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, was released in January 1963, in the midst of a legendarily biting British winter, to which its giddy sound was an antidote. &quot;Congratulations, Gentlemen, you&apos;ve just made your first number one,&quot; said their producer, George Martin. And he was right. By early the following year, their songs were crowding the US charts, and they were about to play to 73 million Americans on The Ed Sullivan Show. Once again, they were adopted as a panacea for cold and grim times \u2013 this time less a matter of the weather than the pall cast by the murder of President Kennedy. Only two years later, they would reach the apex of their fame, chased around the Deep South by fundamentalist Christians outraged by John Lennon&apos;s claim that they were &quot;bigger than Jesus&quot;, while their music took on the textures and expanded horizons traceable \u2013 at least in part \u2013 to Lennon and George Harrison&apos;s use of LSD. Such is the remarkable pace of a story that has been told by scores of writers, a story about four young musicians but no end of other things: the cities of Liverpool, Hamburg and London; class, and the shaking of English hierarchies; pop&apos;s transmutation into a global culture; and the western world&apos;s passage from a world still defined by the second world war and its aftermath, to the accelerated modernity we know today. Everything in the tale pulses with significance and drama. It seems barely believable, and in the best Beatles books, it still burns. Philip Norman&apos;s Shout! was first published in 1981, and remains a glorious example of how to write about music, while also writing about much more. Of the Beatles in the mid-1960s, and their phenomenal success a mere three years or so after &quot;Love Me Do&quot; appeared, he wrote this: &quot;Only in ancient times, when boy emperors and pharaohs were clothed, even fed with pure gold, had very young men commanded an equivalent adoration, fascination and constant, expectant scrutiny. Nor could anyone suppose that to be thus \u2013 to have such youth, and wealth, such clothes and cars and servants and cars \u2013 made for any state other than inconceivable happiness. For no one since the boy pharoahs \u2026 had known, as the Beatles now knew, how it felt to have felt everything, done everything, tasted everything, had a surfeit of everything; to live on that blinding, deadening, numbing surfeit which made each, on bad days, think he was ageing at twice the usual rate.&quot; Thanks to an obsession that began when a babysitter played me a Beatles record around the time of my fifth birthday, I own 67 books about the band (before I wrote this article, I counted them). They range from the crass and moronic, via the comically arcane, to the serious and brilliant. Among them, there is an American volume titled The Walrus Was Paul, all about the insane late 60s conspiracy theory in which McCartney had been dead since 1966 and secretly replaced by a doppelganger. If I&apos;m feeling really masochistic, I occasionally pick up The Day John Met Paul, an absurd and thoroughly speculative minute-by-minute account\u00a0of the day in 1957 when Lennon first encountered McCartney at a church fete. I treasure an American hardback of The Longest Cocktail Party, the memoir of a long-lost American called Richard DiLello, who worked for the Beatles&apos; doomed and decadent Apple company as a PR assistant and &quot;house hippy&quot;. And at least once a year, I reread Barry Miles&apos;s Many Years From Now, an account of McCartney&apos;s 60s that, thanks to voluminous input from its subject, reads more like a memoir, and a brittle one at that. Every few pages, McCartney decides to pick a Lennon-McCartney composition, and then specify each of their contributions: &quot;In My Life&quot;, long assumed to be Lennon&apos;s work alone, was &quot;my melody \u2026 my guitar riff&quot;; when it comes to &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, &quot;because John sang it, you might have to give him 60% of it.&quot; That book was a transparent response to the posthumous Lennon industry, the most compelling product of which is Lennon Remembers, the full transcript of the 1970 interview he granted to the founder of Rolling Stone magazine, Jann Wenner. Lennon Remembers is defined by the bitterness and candour of a mind trying to make sense of Norman&apos;s &quot;deadening surfeit&quot;, lashing out at former colleagues and associates, and describing the distance between the good clean fun portrayed by just about every newspaper journalist who travelled with them, and what actually happened. &quot;When we hit town, we hit it,&quot; he told Wenner. &quot;We were not pissing about. There&apos;s photographs of me crawling about in Amsterdam on my knees, coming out of whorehouses and things like that. And people saying [cheerfully]: &apos;Good morning, John.&apos;&quot;     Hunter Davies, The Beatles: The Authorised Biography    At the time the interview happened, there were only two Beatles books of any quality. Hunter Davies&apos;s authorised biography was published in 1968, admirably researched and brimming with access \u2013 but stymied by his artless\u00a0prose, and the constraints of being the band&apos;s in-house writer. There was also the Penguin paperback Love Me Do: The Beatles&apos; Progress, written by\u00a0the New Yorker Michael Braun through 1963 and early 1964. &quot;That was\u00a0a true book,&quot; Lennon told Wenner.\u00a0&quot;He wrote about how we were, which was bastards \u2026 You have to be a bastard to make it, man. That&apos;s a fact, and the Beatles were the biggest bastards on earth.&quot; Braun was a former assistant to Stanley Kubrick, and a writer whose work appeared in the Observer and the Sunday Times (he died in 1997; one of his obituaries described him as &quot;a penniless fl\u00e2neur&quot;, drawn to people whose\u00a0&quot;personal mythology was not limited by prosaic biographical fact&quot;). Contrary to Lennon&apos;s picture, his book \u2013 a tour diary, essentially, which follows them around provincial England, on to Paris and New York \u2013 largely offers a close-up of the Beatles as you might expect it: witty, blunt, quickly breaking out of the drab conventions of British showbiz. He evokes ordinary places witnessing quite extraordinary scenes, in incisively simple terms: in the north-east of England, for example, he keeps the Beatles company in yet another hotel, watching them do a phone interview with a DJ in far-away Melbourne, while a gaggle of fans looks up at the window. &quot;When the call was finished,&quot; Braun wrote, &quot;they turned the lights out and spent a few minutes looking at the girls through a slit in the curtains before going to bed. The next morning as the Beatles left Sunderland several girls were still gathered in front of the hotel, huddling against the winds blowing from the North Sea.&quot; This is what is so compelling about those early treks around provincial theatres and ballrooms: moments of quiet, when the band seemed to marvel at what was happening to them; and the sense of an extended goodbye (by the autumn of 1966, they had stopped touring altogether). Davies&apos;s book pushed an approved vision of unbroken brotherhood just as the Beatles began to come to grief. There was then a period of publishing quiet, until in the wake of Lennon&apos;s murder in 1980, Hamish Hamilton published Shout!, and thereby planted the seed of serious Beatles biography and commentary \u2013 arguably, of serious writing about pop in general. Shout! predated Stanley Booth&apos;s equally accomplished The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones by three years, and Robert Shelton&apos;s flawed Dylan biography No Direction Home by five. Perhaps because its triumph lies less in its evocation of the music than its sure grasp of how amazing the Beatles story was, and how important they were as representatives of their age, it has rather been passed over by music writers \u2013 but it is a great book. A couple of years ago, I spoke to Norman about the task he had faced. &quot;The idea of writing a proper book that happened to be about a pop group \u2026 no one had really tried it,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s a very hard thing to do. You&apos;re dealing with so much dross: you have to say things like: &apos;The record went to number three in the charts.&apos; How do you say that in a literate sentence? Also, relating what happened to a performer to what was happening in the world is difficult to do, without sounding ridiculous. You skate a line between treating your subject-matter seriously, and ridiculously over-seriously. English writers tend to be flippant; American writers can be almost funereal.&quot; Shout! arrived just as rock&apos;s golden years became distant enough to be properly considered (Norman&apos;s biographies of the Rolling Stones, Elton John and Lennon were to follow). In its wake came a trickle of Beatles books, until another game-changing work appeared in 1994: Revolution in the Head, a triumph of musical and cultural scholarship. MacDonald was an alumnus of the New Musical Express but was no rock hack; he had already published The New Shostakovich. Revolution in the Head is one of those books that can be reread endlessly. I tend to pick it up at least every couple of months, alight on its analysis of Beatles songs to which I haven&apos;t listened for a while, and then go to the music. Even comparative makeweights are rigorously examined, and so given renewed allure: &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; is built from &quot;strident dramatic contrasts&quot;; &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot; is &quot;menacingly pointed (possibly at McCartney)&quot;; more straightforwardly, Harrison&apos;s &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot; is praised as &quot;an archetypal B-side from an era when B-sides were worth flipping a single for&quot;. All of it only underlines what a loss MacDonald was to writing: after a long spell of depression, he killed himself in August 2003.     Ian MacDonald, Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' Records and the Sixties    Fortuitously, Revolution in the Head arrived in the first phase of so-called Britpop, when worship of the Beatles became almost compulsory. Books about them began appearing by the dozen \u2013 often cheap, nasty and pointless. There are, thankfully, exceptions. Thanks to a tip from the writer Jon Savage, I now own Magic Circles: The Beatles in Dream and History by the self-styled &quot;independent scholar&quot; from Brooklyn Devin McKinney. Stylistically, it takes its lead from the Rolling Stone writer and pop theorist Greil Marcus. McKinney&apos;s book is often maddening and silly, but when he&apos;s good, he&apos;s very good. Of the Beatles&apos; output in 1966, he writes: &quot;Virtually every piece of music they put their hands to this year comes out in some way twisted, acerbic, jagged.&quot; That year&apos;s Revolver, he says, was &quot;the first Beatle album to find itself in the dark, not the light&quot;. When the band covered material by American rock&apos;n&apos;rollers, the key to what made their versions different was this: &quot;They were interested in stripping a song to its parts, exposing its frame, then retooling it with what was theirs: a group dynamic, a oneness of instruments and voices that made four discrete noises into one great noise, a syncopation of chaos; and a driving quality of hysteria.&quot; That captures well the Beatles&apos; renditions of songs by Little Richard and Chuck Berry, but it also sums up the 100mph brilliance of such watershed records as &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot; \u2013 all energy and irresistible joy. Now, two more significant, serious works are on the way: an anthology of John Lennon&apos;s letters, edited by Hunter Davies, and the first of a three-volume biography of the band by Mark Lewisohn, the Beatles expert responsible for two consummate reference books: The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, and the even more exhaustive Complete Beatles Chronicle, a day-by-day account of their career, full of descriptions of their pharaonic lives. Lewisohn has been working on volume one of his biography for close to a decade: he, his agent and his publisher will say very little about when it will be published, though there are reliable indications that it will appear next year. Its author, incidentally, is present and correct in Shout!, as a Beatles-fixated eight-year-old in his native Pinner \u2013 a reminder that as well as endlessly sparking the intellect, Beatles music works more basic wonders. Page 78 portrays Lewisohn at home in 1967, listening to the album which confirmed that in the five years since the release of &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, the Beatles and their art had been transformed: as Sgt Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band blared from indoors, he &quot;stood in the garden as it played, shaking his head wildly while trying not to dislodge the cardboard moustache under his nose&quot;.", "sentences": ["There&apos;s photographs of me crawling about in Amsterdam on my knees, coming out of whorehouses and things like that."], "title": "The best books on the Beatles", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/26/beatles-best-books", "tags": ["Music", "The Beatles", "Biography", "Culture", "Books", "Music", "John Lennon", "Paul McCartney", "Pop and rock"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-26T09:47:00Z", "article": "In South Africa, with its history of colonialism and apartheid, each creative work makes a political point. Whether focusing on injustice or universal loneliness, here, one makes a political point. One is either part of what former Nobel prize committee member Horace Engdahl calls &quot;the great dialogue of literature about the improvement of humanity&quot;, or suggesting that one doesn&apos;t particularly care for it. Being raised within an Afrikaner ethnic clamp and language, of which the very foundations are political, the issue of whether writing should in fact be political seems asking the obvious. What was interesting was the influence of Afrikaans literature on the formation of a community. Two examples: a play called Die Pluimsaad waai ver, by NP van Wyk Louw, the best poet Afrikaans produced, formed part of the Republic festivities in 1966. The Anglo-Boer War tension within Afrikanerdom itself was van Wyk Louw&apos;s theme and underpinned by his belief in loyal resistance which reminded a nation that it was better to perish than to survive through injustice. The play therefore opened with an old woman walking on to the stage, asking: &quot;What is a nation?&quot; The opening was attended by Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd. A few days later, on Republic Day at the Voortrekker monument, Verwoerd raised his disapproval of the play to three quarters of a million people, the biggest crowd ever to have assembled in the country until then. When will it happen, Verwoerd asked, that writers and poets step forward to sing the praises of our heroic achievements instead of asking waveringly: &quot;What is a nation?&quot; but who will cry out: &quot;This is my nation, my nation is like this, thus it can do wonders, thus it can create its own future&quot;. He was loudly applauded and van Wyk Louw was deeply hurt. In the light of today, this interaction is something to envy. A head of state who goes to a serious play, commissioned by his department of art, and then engages with the text sounds like a head of state who goes to an art gallery. One who walks through an exhibition all about how his party has sold out its values, then goes out not to censor but to engage with the essence of the exhibition. The second example of political literary engagement is a poetry volume by poet GA Watermeyer titled Die republiek van duisend jaar, sponsored by the Afrikaner bank Volkskas. The volume addresses teachers, police, youth, church leaders, war veterans, workers and captains of industry, calling them to excellence in serving the Afrikaner. One poem says: &quot;The hand that draws the voter&apos;s cross/is the hand that touches the future.&quot; In another, the police say: &quot;We are the bridle that tames crime; we are the hand with which children safely cross the street; we are order, we are law; we are the eye watched by the Eye of God. To teachers: You are the casting forms of our youth; you are building with more than steel and stone, our being a nation revolves around this.&quot; As I child I often heard these poems recited at school events or by politicians. The point I make is that literature was used, in contrast to being censored, both to engage sharply about values and principles and to create a coherent vocabulary (in this case for the Afrikaner) about identity. But most important of all: the fact that the voice of the artist was valued proved crucial for later, effective, anti-apartheid resistance by writers and singers. The ANC in exile also interacted with art. Those who attended any of their cultural events in Amsterdam, London or Zimbabwe would never forget how art wove all the dreams, yearnings, furies and griefs into enduring visions of an all-encompassing, beautiful and humane future. The transformative use and political effect of art blossomed in the arts pages of, especially, the Mail and Guardian and Vrye Weekblad. We dreamt that every library would adopt a writer to organise reading and writing circles; that every bus stop, train, railway station and government waiting area would have beautiful posters with the words of our poets; that every foyer guard would have books to read; that many small, spaza-like book shops would shoot up as happened in Lesotho and Zimbabwe; that translation would proliferate; that classrooms would spin with books; that newspapers would plumb our literature; that we would know the words of our writers by heart; that young writers would find support to tell their breathtaking truths. We knew how, in other cultures, ordinary people quoted the poems of their writers \u2013 Russian poet Anna Ahkmatova heard herself being recited while standing in a bread queue. Through Pablo Neruda, Chileans made love and salads and fought for freedom. The ANC of 1994 continued its engagement with literature. Opening the first democratic parliament, Nelson Mandela used an Ingrid Jonker poem to cast the sorrow of the past into a transcendent embrace. Yes, Mandela is a reader. He mentions the effect of Xhosa poet SEK Mqhayi on him. He once engaged Afrikaans writer Elsa Joubert on the relationship between white and black in her book: Die Staf van Monomotapa. The new parliament teemed with art \u2013 imbongis were everywhere, Jennifer Ferguson sang in her bench, an international art exhibition was on the walls, Trevor Manuel kicked off his budget speech with literary quotes and languages (he was the first to quote Ben Okri), labour minister Shepherd Mdladlana performed the poem by JJR Jolobe, Ukwenziwa komkhonzi (The making of a servant) while being loudly applauded by fellow MPs across party lines; Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi used poetry and of course so did the early Thabo Mbeki. He not only quoted from Mqhayi, Shakespeare and Yeats, but could do a traditional praise poem off the cuff or deliver his I am an African speech with such poetic rhythm and imagery that it deservedly became the most remembered, quoted and praised speech of this country. Remember also the debate within the ANC about John Coetzee&apos;s Disgrace \u2013 engaging, not censoring; a political party who understood the value of literature. However, this engagement was never properly supported by policy and deed. Since 1994, the department of arts and culture is the harmlessness-inducing trashcan of the ANC: the IFP trade-offs and those politically-too-free-tongued such as Winnie Mandela and Pallo Jordan. We produce dancers, singers and musicians of international quality, our writers are translated, read and engaged across the world, our visual artists count among the best \u2013 all without a focused supportive art department. Left in the lurch by efforts to eradicate poverty, stabbed in the back by an education system, talent is bursting from neglected grassroots in the blind hope of being picked up by talent competitions or patrons. Why appoint somebody as poet laureate, or announce international or local awards to South African poets and writers without a proper programme in place to introduce, translate and analyse the work of, for example, Willie Kgositsile, Wally Serote and Sindiwe Magona? This makes me wonder: which books are on the bedside tables of our ministers? How many book shelves had been built into the newly renovated presidential and ministerial houses? How many reading circles are in the parliamentary complexes? What novels are the captains of industry reading there in business class? What poetry volumes are in the judges&apos; smart cases? What literary texts are to be found in doctors&apos; waiting rooms, or on teachers&apos; or parents&apos; tables? Do we really want to fund an SABC which feeds us the crass consumerism of programmes like Top Billing or glamorous events where the brains of celebs, desperate to say something meaningful, rear around like newly hatched chicks in empty nests? How is it possible that our television channels are bookless, but feed a population, fatally choking on inequality, a continuous insolent stream of bling and d\u00e9cor by shoe-obsessed yappers for whom the phrase &quot;under the breadline&quot; is just another diet. Radio, thank God, still has excellent English and Afrikaans book programmes, Afrikaans an exquisite poetry programme by Margot Luyt. Why should a country read its writers? The short answer is so that one&apos;s president does not need to ask: why do we rape babies and kill each other? He would have read Nkosinathi Sithole&apos;s Hunger eats a man in Zulu and knew. He would have read what we write from our wounds and our anguished hopes and he would never see us as election fodder. Because a government hears only its own voice, it knows it hears only its own voice, yet it likes to harbour the illusion that it is hearing the voice of the people, and it demands that the people too should harbour this illusion. That is why a cabinet should read literature. Neither the state which it controls, nor the good plans to turn the country around, would help in the absence of a visionary vocabulary (produced best by writers and poets) to create what Martha Nussbaum described as an inspired emphatic social cohesion. The longer answer is that literature inflects the anguish of reality in a way that theoretical discussions of the same issues cannot achieve, making possible a kind of understanding not accessible by other means. Annie Gagiano remarked that being in the world and governing requires an intricate weave of perception and response of reacting and embracing. Reading literature&apos;s continuous &quot;presensing&quot; of the world, (as Heidegger put it) creates reflexivity and nuanced knowing. But let me quote the poets: Matthew Arnold:  Knowledge of literature is beneficial to critical thinking and moral health and should be an undertaking as serious and valuable as moneymaking or scientific advancement.   Shelley:   Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.  Dylan Thomas:  A good poem helps to change the shape and significance of the universe,\u00a0helps to extend everyone&apos;s knowledge of himself and the world around him.\u00a0  Walt Whitman:  When a country ignores its poets, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of their full returns. The poet is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key. He is the equaliser of his age and land.  \u2022 Antjie Krog was speaking at Cape Town&apos;s Open Book Festival as part of the Edinburgh World Writers&apos; Conference.", "sentences": ["Those who attended any of their cultural events in Amsterdam, London or Zimbabwe would never forget how art wove all the dreams, yearnings, furies and griefs into enduring visions of an all-encompassing, beautiful and humane future."], "title": "Antjie Krog: Should Should power listen to poetry?| World Writers Conference", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/26/antjie-krog-should-power-listen-to-poetry", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Edinburgh international book festival", "South Africa", "Race issues", "Philosophy", "Poetry", "Fiction"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-09-27T08:00:00Z", "article": "Let&apos;s get the caveats out of the way first. Judged against the usual checklist of what makes a great James Bond movie, Diamonds Are Forever is not a great James Bond movie. Sean Connery&apos;s last official outing as 007 lacks the radioactive virility of his first three assignments. Nor, for that matter, does it possess the playful snap and panache of the first three Roger Moore vehicles that followed. Diamonds is the Bond series&apos; unlucky number seven: punch-drunk and paunchy, wanton and woozy. I think it may be my favourite. Connery thought he was out but the studio pulled him back in \u2013 offering a then-unheard sum of \u00a31.25m (equivalent to \u00a320m today) to re-engage the actor&apos;s services and thereby salvage a stuttering franchise. And yet Connery clearly does not want to be there. He shuffles through the motions like some ageing heavyweight showboater, flirting with disaster, his toupee slipping. When Bond is not fighting for his life and banging his elbows inside a cramped Amsterdam elevator, he&apos;s being kicked to hell by a pair of self-regarding girl acrobats in the Nevada desert. He&apos;s knackered, out of shape, halfway through the exit door. Legend has it that the very last scene Connery actually filmed was the one at the crematorium, in which Bond is knocked senseless, dropped inside a coffin and pushed towards the flames. But the genius (intentional or otherwise) of Diamonds Are Forever is in the way it takes its lead from Connery&apos;s bruised, jaundiced performance. The later Roger Moore missions (Octopussy, A View to a Kill) made the mistake of variously disguising or compensating for Bond&apos;s advancing decrepitude and wound up looking ludicrous. Diamonds, by contrast, matches the star&apos;s tone and tempo quite beautifully.     Jill St John as Tiffany Case in Diamonds Are Forever.  Photograph: Cine Text/Allstar/Sportsphoto Ltd    Fittingly, the plot seems to drift in and out, like ground-fog or the frequency of a long-distance radio broadcast. Bond is on the trail of diamond smugglers and the trail leads him first to obligatory Bond girl Tiffany Case (Jill St John), who keeps changing her hair colour, and thence to the upper-crust Blofeld (Charles Gray), who plans to hold the planet to ransom and auction nuclear supremacy to the highest bidder. &quot;The satellite is at present over Kansas,&quot; he explains, eager to demonstrate the power of his outer-space warhead. &quot;But if we destroy Kansas, the world may not hear about it for years.&quot; The film comes into its own during its extended middle portion, played out amid the casinos, circuses and funeral parlours of Las Vegas. This is an upside-down, hall-of-mirrors landscape in which an elderly hoodlum is booked to perform a standup show at 6pm and where a pair of dubious gay killers skip hand-in-hand through the desert beyond town (I like to see this as 007&apos;s touching concession to the Stonewall era).  Much of the action, meantime, pivots around the invisible figure of Willard Whyte, a thinly-veiled Howard Hughes, gone to ground in the penthouse suite of the palatial &quot;Whyte House&quot; and apparently running business from a bank of phones while sitting on the toilet \u2013 much as Lyndon Johnson is reputed to have done. &quot;This is not the real White House and he&apos;s not the president,&quot; cautions Bond at one stage. The reminder, though, only adds to the suspicion that it is and he is \u2013 and that we are basically adrift in a corroded parallel America in which Vegas plays Washington DC and the moon landings are mocked up on a neighbouring sound-stage.            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view trailer Is this the western democracy that 007 is fighting to preserve? If so, his mission appears fatally hobbled from the opening credits. If so, moreover, nobody around him gives much of a damn. After stumbling across the moon-landing set, our hero boosts a car and lights out across town with the Vegas cops in hot pursuit. In the midst of the chase, director Guy Hamilton suddenly, devilishly, opts to cut away to show the chase from the gloomy interior of a Fremont Street arcade. Inside, under glass, the tourists are lined up like zombies at the slot-machines, utterly oblivious to the screeching tyres and wailing sirens just yards from their heads. No doubt each era gets the Bond it deserves. Cubby Broccoli&apos;s franchise started out in the early 60s fired by a sleek moral certitude, prowling a world of clearly defined good and evil before slipping into jokey self-parody during the mid-to-late 70s. Diamonds, though, is the missing link, the crucial transition; ideally placed at the turn of the decade and implicitly haunted by noises off in the nation at large. Here is a Bond film in which the old glamour has lost its sparkle and the resolute hero has lost his way. It&apos;s jaded, uncertain and disillusioned. It&apos;s vicious, mordant, at times blackly comic. It&apos;s oddly brilliant, the best of the bunch: the perfect bleary Bond film for an imperfect bleary western world. Favourite line: I do like &quot;Alimentary, Dr Leiter&quot; (Bond&apos;s neat response when asked the whereabouts of the diamonds on Peter Franks&apos; body).

Ticket sales suggest the inhabitants of the North Zealand town will have upped sticks to the capital&apos;s Parken Stadium, almost 15 miles away, to celebrate Nordsjaelland&apos;s unlikely &apos;home&apos; debut in the Champions League against the holders, Chelsea, suitable visitors for a landmark occasion. There is a sense of disbelief in these parts that any of this is actually happening. Roberto Di Matteo&apos;s side are partypoopers at a celebration. What makes the scenario all the more remarkable is that Nordsjaelland have been in existence for 21 years, and have courted scandal and financial catastrophe already in that brief time. The Wild Tigers sprung from the merger of Farum Idraetsklub and Stavnsholt FC, their rise through the domestic divisions initially overseen by Farum&apos;s mayor, Peter Brixtofte, until his chairmanship was tarnished when it emerged he had abused his position to overpay private companies to provide council services in return for sponsorship monies for the club. Farum Boldklub, as it was then known, was close to bankruptcy when Brixtofte resigned \u2013 he was subsequently jailed \u2013 before a local businessman, Allan Pedersen, invested in the set-up. Boldsklub became FC Nordsjaelland in 2003 to mark a clean break, even if his own chairmanship has since been tinged in controversy after he bought the club from his holding company, AKP Holdings, just prior to the latter slipping into administration. The dispute over that sale is ongoing and will be heard in the country&apos;s supreme court, so to have claimed a first Superliga title last season amid that backdrop of turmoil was a staggering achievement. Kasper Hjulmand&apos;s team may have lost their opening game 2-0 at Shakhtar Donetsk, but they are an unknown quantity at this level. Parken Stadium should be close to capacity for Chelsea&apos;s visit \u2013 the 25,000 tickets sold already represents 5,000 more than the entire population of Farum \u2013 and, while the visitors do not know what to expect, at least one of the Danes&apos; number will boast a familiar name.

We hope we can cause a few upsets.&quot; Laudrup has enjoyed a nomadic existence, his career path following that of his father&apos;s coaching positions. He was born in Barcelona, where Michael won four consecutive La Liga titles before returning home to Denmark, and lived in Madrid, Kobe and Amsterdam before a return to Denmark, where he was affiliated to Sollerod-Vedbaek and Lyngby while Laudrup Sr worked with the national team and Brondby. When he took over at Getafe in 2007, Laudrup Jr duly joined the Real Madrid youth system across the city. The youngster&apos;s decision to drop the Laudrup name from his shirt, preferring &quot;Andreas&quot; instead, was a direct reflection of the expectation involved in being his father&apos;s son. It was only when Michael moved to Spartak Moscow as manager that Andreas returned to Denmark, initially with Lyngby again and then with Nordsjaelland, with whom the youth international signed a three-year contract in 2009. These days, with his family absent in Swansea, he acknowledges that playing in Denmark feels as if he is ensconced in a foreign land. &quot;In a way, I already live &apos;abroad&apos; given my parents are so far away,&quot; he said. &quot;Over the years, it&apos;s always been where my parents are that feels like home. &quot;But I&apos;m trying to prove myself.

But there were no shouting mobs, no injuries and no\u00a0property damage. We don&apos;t fully understand whether the absurd overreaction to the silly film reflects a cultural predisposition to violence to solve problems, a victim mentality or the lack of an Islamic enlightenment.

How many more deaths and how much more damage must occur before we cease poking sticks into a hornet&apos;s nest?

Robert Gardiner Welshman&apos;s Reef, Victoria, Australia Taxing the rich in France In her article about the announced 75% tax for France&apos;s wealthiest citizens, Kim Willsher depicts the threat of an exodus of the country&apos;s entrepreneurial elite (Will 75% tax send France&apos;s rich into exile?). The case of Bernard Arnault hows how those with deep wallets must not only face high tax rates, but deep animosities in the public&apos;s opinion. As the chief executive of Louis Vuitton and France&apos;s richest man is ogling Belgium citizenship, for no other reason than tax consequences, the leftwing newspaper Lib\u00e9ration incites him: &quot;Get off, rich fool!&quot; Unfortunately, this nasty debate blends into another, beloved animosity of the French: namely, that against the &quot;rosbifs&quot;, since the British prime minister said he would &quot;roll out the red carpet&quot; for French tax evaders. I am sure Willsher did not want to nourish such hatred. This is why I have to make a specification concerning the 75%, and I can do it as a neutral Swiss. Willsher rightly remarked that tax burdens are hard to calculate. Cunning politicians, however, complicate things even more: although it is correct that the new tax aims at those with an income higher than \u20ac1m ($1.3m), it is not their whole income that will be subject to the 75%, but only the tranche above the million. Below it, Arnault and his friends can bank on 45%. Simon Bordier Lucerne, Switzerland Michelangelo&apos;s sharks What a crying shame that the urinal and the underground map had not been invented by the time of Michelangelo (Mischievous birth of the modern, 21 September). To think that such a talented man should have wasted all those years lying on his back in the Sistine Chapel, slogging away at his old-fashioned art, without the benefit of enlightenment by the revered and referenced Marcel Duchamp, &quot;today&apos;s contemporary artists&quot; and Will Gompertz. What dizzying heights of creativity might Michelangelo not have reached had he known that the idea should be primary and the medium secondary? For all we know, a whole shoal of sharks in formaldehyde, indeed! Vita longa, ars brevis (these days). Bernard Galton St-Nazaire-sur-Charente, France \u2022 Despite the allusive tease of Monty Python in his text, Will Gompertz miffed me by his oversight of Terry Gilliam amid the pantheon of seminal Modernist artists. I would insert Gilliam into the schematic at the intersection of Readymade and Post-Modernism avenues. R M Fransson Denver, Colorado, US Canada&apos;s rightward lurch Reading Jonathan Kaiman&apos;s article was like looking through someone else&apos;s spectacles: one saw a fuzzy, skewed picture, somewhat rose-tinted (Is Canada&apos;s age of innocence at an end? 21 September). This often seems to be the case with Guardian stories about Canada: foreground and background are mixed up and the central issues are missing. The reality is that we can observe the going out of the lights of democracy all over the country. Those who do not agree with OGL (our great leader) are considered to be terrorists, in general, and if it can be done, individuals who stand up to him politically are fired. Vindictiveness is the hallmark of this government, together with a denial of information, which is replaced with disinformation and dirty tricks at election time. It has adopted the playbook of the most rightwing Republicans in the US, the latest trick being stuffing all kinds of ill-assorted policies into one mammoth bill and steamrolling it through parliament, where debate is being cut off arbitrarily. Has your correspondent not heard of OGL proroguing our parliament when it was about to hold his feet to the fire about his refusal to disclose information to it to which it is entitled? The latest is that, after saying he had no intention to do so before the last elections, Stephen Harper may be pushing through a bill to re-criminalise abortion. He rules with the same intent as Louis XIV: L&apos;etat, c&apos;est moi and apr\u00e8s nous, le d\u00e9luge. It is not that Kaiman&apos;s article was incorrect, but it left the worst things out. They are what really are causing the undercurrents of anxiety to which he refers. Ellen Pye Delta, British Columbia, Canada \u2022 Jonathan Kaiman&apos;s description of Canada&apos;s rightward ideological drift from its traditionally liberal governance seems less a loss of innocence than a return to a disturbingly infantile form of it. On top of the Harper government&apos;s characteristically conservative suspicion of minorities, it exhibits a truly alarming irrationality in its denial of climate change imperatives. Their fixation on tar sands profits, despite ruinous overall costs, is every bit as bizarre as Nero&apos;s fiddling. The Harper government is by no means unique. Australia&apos;s opposition conservatives display the same defiantly nescient attitude towards the laws of nature, down to the manifest depletion of fish stocks and ground water. It may well turn out to be our terminator gene at work. John Hayward Weegena, Tasmania, Australia Briefly \u2022 In your 21 September issue, George Monbiot notes that the number of people in the world with dementia will reach 100 million by 2050. In the same issue, your feature about a care home in Amsterdam for dementia patients claims that in the 20 years after 2030 \u2013 ie in 2050 \u2013 the number of people with dementia will have increased to 260 million: an excess of 160 million. While these vastly different totals are based on estimates, it does occur to me that, with any luck, many us who can still do their maths will not be numbered among the sufferers.

Attention is now growing around people-centred innovation, which creates a participatory, practice-based process to find sustainable new strategies for a socially and sustainable future. This approach has been given impetus by a paper from the European Union&apos;s thinktank Empowering people, driving change \u2013 social innovation in the European Union, which said &quot;the long-held belief that economic growth creates employment and wealth that goes on to alleviate poverty has been disproved by recent events, and the time has now come to try new ways of bringing people out of poverty and promoting growth and well-being not only for, but also with citizens&quot;. As a result, the European Commission is looking wider than the usual suspects of governments and traditional institutions, to solve problems and is reaching out to work with social entrepreneurs, designers, active citizens and other change makers. This is quite a daunting task because these unusual suspects are often far from Brussels and not very interested in EU policies. Moreover, social innovation is by nature experimental, cross cutting, collaborative and dispersed. Social innovators are comfortable working with uncertainty, without blueprints, roadmaps or clear-cut business plans. Not a great fit with the bureaucratic culture of the EC which is risk averse, focused on financial control and keen on projected outputs. Two distinct worlds, that do not mingle well. It means that social Innovation requires innovation in the social model of the EU itself. An interesting encounter between these two distinct worlds was set up in Naples in 2011. The Euclid Network and the UniCredit Foundation ran an international social innovation competition called Naples 2.0 to mobilise global brainpower to provide concrete solutions to social challenges identified by the citizens of Naples. Why Naples you might wonder? A city of beauty and squalor, of failing government and organized crime. But Naples has a long tradition of citizens taking things in their own hands and coming up with creative solutions when none seem possible. Why a competition? Because no one or no idea is ruled in or out and the prize rewards creativity. Seven prize winners received help to develop their business plans, one is on track for \u20ac150,000 of funding for a local catering business. Naples 2.0 was the first competition of its kind and was followed with interest by the EC. The key was to engage local people in issues that were difficult to solve. It demanded that everyone \u2013 organisers, funders and innovators \u2013 had to be willing to invest time and money without knowing the outcome. Ultimately this is social innovation. Building on this experience, EC president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso is launching the commission&apos;s first social innovation competition on 1 October, in co-operation with Nesta and Euclid, and in memory of Diogo Vasconcelos \u2013 the fighter for social innovation who spent his career trying to bridge the gap between citizens and the political system, who tragically died last year. The competition is geared to creating a strong platform for social innovators across Europe. A courageous experiment to unlock the enormous potential; the passion and the power of the people. But, can a competition bridge the gap between citizens and politics? Competitions are cost-effective, create a level playing field so anyone can come up with an extraordinary solution to a challenge or problem. Whether this is the perfect instrument for traditional institutions to foster and stimulate social innovation is too early to say. But it is an attempt to shift the focus to the people, to grass roots initiatives and to what works in daily life. Euclid Network will bring experience and ideas to the new competition in the coming months to see if we can identify successful local initiatives and also create a learning network where ideas can flourish \u2013 to foster a fertile ecosystem for social innovation. Enthusiasm for social innovation does not exempt the EC from innovation in its own practices and policy making. There is a real need to bring more dynamic processes into play and focus on creating valuable outcomes for the people of Europe which are far more than bean counting or balancing the books. An important step is to realise that focusing on actively engaging people, and not just on economic growth, is the route to a socially sustainable future. From this can come a better functioning EU and a more democratic and liveable society. It&apos;s the people, stupid.

Yes please. Not least when the other match in Group E pits the reigning champions of Spain against their Dutch counterparts. Let&apos;s face it, you&apos;d need a heart of stone not to be excited by a Champions League group featuring so many genuine Champions League contenders and Ajax. Having failed to qualify from a decidedly difficult group last season, Manchester City&apos;s efforts to go one better this time round got off to a shaky start when they threw away a 2-1 lead against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. In such a horrible group, they&apos;ll be eager to get three points on the board against Borussia Dortmund this evening. The German outfit needed a late goal from Robert Lewandowski to edge past Ajax at the Westfalenstadion in their opening match and they&apos;ll be confident of winning another point or three tonight as they take on a defensively suspect team that has failed to keep a clean sheet in any of its nine matches to date this season. Financially prudent after years of behind-the-scenes chaos and with a recent habit of producing the kind of end-of-year accounts that would bring a smile to the chops of even the most stony-faced bean-counter, Borussia Dortmund couldn&apos;t be less like Manchester City off the field of play. But while extreme caution is the watchword behind the scenes, their manager Jurgen Klopp has ensured that the club&apos;s on-field ethos is anything but. Their eye-pleasing, swashbuckling style has served them well on the domestic front over the past two seasons, but not so well in Europe. In last season&apos;s Champions League they finished bottom of their group, hopelessly adrift of the more canny and experienced Arsenal, Marseille and Olympiakos, but tonight&apos;s encounter should provide some indication of how far both they and City have evolved in their bids to establish themselves as more mature forces to be reckoned with in Europe.  Some stuff you might like: My colleague Marcus Christenson may be a Swede but he&apos;s no turnip, so if he writes a 686-word primer on Borussia Dortmund and their hopes for this season&apos;s Champions League, you could do a lot worse with your time than read it.

In front of them, David Silva and Samir Nasri will play on the right and left of Sergio Aguero, who&apos;ll be buzzing around in his own inimitable way behind lone frontman Edin Dzeko. How Borussia Dortmund will line up: With seven Germans, three Poles and a Serb, that&apos;s how. They too will almost certainly play a 4-2-3-1, with Messrs Piszczek, Subotic, Hummels and Schmeizer lining up from right to left in front of goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. Ilkay Gundogan and Sven Bender will protect the back four, while Jakub Blaszczykowski, Mario Gotze and Marco Reus will form an intimidating attacking trio behind Robert Lewandowski.  Happy birthday to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who turned 32 today. I thought he was older.  In the Sky Sports studio, Graeme Souness speaks: &quot;I hope City are very, very aggressive against this German team today. They need to get them on the back foot and score a goal early. You can&apos;t allow this German team to come here and play their football because they are a very, very good team and they will create chances tonight.&quot;  Not long now: Vincent Kompany exchanges pennants with his opposite number Roman Weidenfeller and the referee tosses the coin.  1 min: City kick off playing from left to right and Samir Nasri gets away the first shot in anger, linking up well with Edin Dzeko before bringing a save out of Weidenfeller with an effort from distance.  2 min: It&apos;s been a lively start. Sergio Aguero goes down in the Dortmund penalty area under a challenge from Mario Gotze, but no penalty is forthcoming. Moments later, Vincent Kompany puts the heart crossways in Joe Hart with a less than assured backpass.  4 min: Dortmund attack down the right flank courtesy of Mario Gotze, who appears to have taken up a position on that wing instead of Jakub Blaszczykowski, who&apos;s tucked in behind his compatriot Robert Lewandowski.  5 min: Manchester City are wearing their customary home attire of light blue shirts, white shorts and light blue socks. Dortmunds players are kitted out in yellow shirts with black (or is it navy?) stripes, black (or is it navy?) shorts and yellow socks with black (or is it navy?) hoops.  6 min: Dortmund attack down the right flank again, with full-back Lukasz Piszczk lofting a cross into the centre. Robert Lewandowski wins the aeriel duel but is unable to control his header and sends the ball high and wide.  8 min: Sergio Aguero takes advantage of the high line being played by Dortmund&apos;s defence to get in behind Neven Subotic on the edge of the penalty area and latch on to a through ball from David Silva. His shot is blocked by Weidenfeller, but the ball breaks to Silva, who tees up Zabaleta this time. He snatches at the ball and shoots it high over the crossbar.  11 min: Borussia Dortmund take on City down the right flank again, with Robert Lewandowski teeing up Mario Gotze. He unleashes a scorching drive from about 18 yards, which Joe Hart tips wide via his right post. Nothing comes from the ensuing corner and Manchester City clear their lines.  14 min: Zabaleta gets on the end of a beautifully angled David Silva pass on the right-hand side of the Dortmund penalty area and tries to shimmy and wriggle his way towards goal from the goal-line. Referee Pavel Kralovec spots an infringement and penalises the Manchester City right-back.  15 min: With 15 minutes gone, the rain is pouring down there&apos;s been no let-up in the furious pace at which this game is being played. It&apos;s splendidly entertaining stuff, but Manchester City fans will be concerned by the manner in which their team is being forced to play on the back foot at home in such an important game. The early stats show they&apos;re dominating possession 62%-38%, but that&apos;s not the way it look in terms of chances created and threats posed.  17 min: On the edge of the final third, David Silva tries to cut in from the right-hand touchline but concedes a throw-in under pressure from Gotze.  20 min: Perhaps it&apos;s because of the rain, which is bucketing down, but the game has got a lot more scrappy in recent minutes, with lots of congestion and general faff in the middle third of the field. The camera cuts to Alex Ferguson, who is present this evening, just as the Manchester United manager cuts loose with a massive yawn.  21 min: Manchester City try to play the ball through the centre and Sergio Aguero does well to lay it off to a team-mate while surrounded by four opposition players.  24 min: Manchester City try to play it out from the back and win a free-kick just inside the Dortmund half for an Ilkay Gundogan foul. The Dortmund defensive midfielder gets a ticking-off from the referee for kicking the ball away, but is spared a yellow card.  26 min: Edin Dzeko times his run perfectly to split central defenders Subotic and Hummels and get on the end of a Silva pass from deep and shank his effort over the bar. Even if he&apos;d scored it wouldn&apos;t have couldn&apos;t as the linesman had flagged, incorrectly, for offside.  27 min: Silva picks out Aguero with a splendid pass down the inside right channel. The Argentinian shoots across the face of goal, bringing a decent save out of Roman Weidenfeller.  29 min: Play switches to the other end of the field, where a free-kick swung into the Manchester City penalty area by Marco Reus briefly causes pandemonium. Good defending from Zabaleta, followed by the intervention of Joe Hart, allows City to clear their lines.  30 min: There&apos;s a big shout for hand-ball as Edin Dzeko tries to get the better of Marco Reus on the right flank, deep in Dortmund territory. No free-kick is forthcoming.  32 min: Javi Garcia goes down clutching his thigh and calls for medical assistance. He&apos;ll catch his death of cold on that wet grass.  32 min: Manchester City substitution: Jack Rodwell on, Javi Garcia off.  33 min: David Silva shimmies this way and that before picking out Sergio Aguero a couple of yards outside the Dortmund penalty area. He looks up and shoots on sight, forcing Roman Wedienfeller to tip the ball over the bar for a corner, from which Dortmund break on the counter and win a corner of their own.  35 min: Marco Reus takes the corner, City fail to clear properly and a bizarre attempt to hack the ball out of defence by David Silva results in it dropping kindly for Subotic. He shoots diagonally from right to left and his low drive fizzes a couple of feet past Joe Hart&apos;s right post.  36 min: Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp likened his side&apos;s style of play to Arsenal yesterday and the similarities become apparent here. With four or five men committed forward, they try a pass too many and attempt to walk the ball into the net when a more direct approach to goal might have yielded a score.  41 min: Wonderful, lightning fast football from Dortmund results in Mario Gotze being left shaking his head in disbelief after being denied by Joe Hart. The German winger had latched on to a return pass from Robert Lewandowski and looked set to put his side ahead, only for Hart to charge off his line, narrow the angle and deny him from close range.  43 min: Dortmund win a free-kick not too far inside the Manchester City half. Reus attempts to play the ball into the penalty area, but his delivery is poor. The ball is cleared, makes its way to Jakub Blaszczykowski on the right flank and he whips in a marvellous cross that somehow manages to evade Gotze and Lewandowski loitering on the edge of the six-yard box.  45 min: City go close again. Zabaleta loops a cross into the Dortmund penalty area from the left. It&apos;s a fraction too high for Dzeko and drops just behind the big striker, where David Silva tries to kung-fu kick the ball past Weidenfeller from six yards, but succeeds only in slashing it over the bar.  45+1 min: Joe Hart is left horribly exposed when Ilkay Gundogan finds himself unmarked in front of goal with the ball bouncing kindly for him and only the goalkeeper to beat. The Dortmund midfielder pulls the trigger, but Hart keeps the scoreboard operator idle with another splendid save from point-blank range.  Half-time: It may be scoreless, but this match has been anything but dull. Chances have gone a begging for both sides, but both goalkeepers deserve credit for putting in superb shifts thus far.  SB Tang writes: &quot;I dunno why everyone, including it seems Herr Klopp, compare Dortmund with Arsenal and Barca,&quot; he says. &quot;The comparison&apos;s only valid insofar as all three sides practise attractive, technically proficient football. In terms of playing style, Dortmund are completely different to Arsenal and Barca. The latter two aim to dominate possession and territory, whereas Dortmund are a speedy, vertical, counter-attacking side who don&apos;t mind enjoying a minority of the possession because they can smash the opposition with a quick, incisive counter-attacking move consisting of approximately five passes or less (instead of the double-digit numbers favoured by Barca and Arsenal).&quot; And here&apos;s the proof: &quot;The first half of this match has amply demonstrated that point,&quot; he says, adjusting the hood of his anorak. &quot;Dortmund enjoyed only 37 per cent of possession but managed more shots on target (5 to 4) and more total shots (10 to 6). As armchair viewers I reckon we can all anecdotally agree that they&apos;re had more chances and of a better quality than City.&quot;  Second half: Borussia Dortmund get the second half underway. There was an interesting vignette just before they did so, when the Manchester City players were shown pausing at the mouth of the tunnel before returning to the pitch. It turns out they were waiting for Yaya Toure, who was delayed leaving the dressing room. Perhaps he was looking for his mojo, which seems to have deserted him thus far tonight. He&apos;s had a poor game by his own imperious standards.  46 min: B\u0142aszczykowski tries his luck with a shot from distance, but doesn&apos;t trouble Joe Hart.  49 min: Weiderfeller spreads his arms in exasperation as he waits to take a goal-kick, as if to implore one of his team-mates to make a move so he can kick it their way. Possibly in protest at their lack of enthusiasm, he eventually punts it down the right flank and out of play.  50 min: With Dortmund attacking City on the break again, Pablo Zabaleta performs heroics to get back and help out his centre-halves with a beautifully timed tackle on Marco Reus on the edge of the City penalty area. He&apos;s been everywhere tonight.  53 min: Another save by Joe Hart, who flings himself to his right to tip yet another rasping effort from Mario Gotze around the post for a corner, from which nothing comes.  56 min: Zabaleta sends a cross in from the right and Weidenfeller darts of his line to punch clear, but misses. From the ensuing scramble, City win a corner, but nothing comes of it and Dortmund clear.  57 min: Manchester City substitution: Aleksandr Kolarov on, Samir Nasri off.  58 min: Manchester City switch to a back three, with Vincent Kompany playing centre-back and Gael Clichy and Matija Nastasic to his left and right. Zabaleta and Kolarov are playing wing backs.  GOAL! Manchester City 0-1 Borussia Dortmund (Reus 60) Jack Rodwell is left hanging his head in shame after playing a loose pass without looking where it was going in midfield. Marco Reus sprints on to it, gallops through on goal like a rugby player greedily accepting an interception and flicks the ball past Joe Hart and into the bottom left-hand corner. Hart got a hand to the ball, but was unable to keep it out.  65 min: Joe Hart is forced into action once again as Reus latches on to a ball played through the City defence and tries his luck with a low diagonal effort from right to left. Hart dashes off his line and block the shot. I think it&apos;s probably fair to say that City&apos;s tactic of playing with a back three is not working.  67 min: Ilkay Gundogan tries his luck with a curling effort from the edge of the penalty area. City are forced to rely on Joe Hart to get them out of jail again and he does exactly that, leaping high to his left to tip the ball over the bar for a corner.  68 min: Manchester City earn some much-needed respite by winning themselves a corner. Nothing comes of it and Dortmund clear.  69 min: Kolorav puts Aguero through on goal with a perfectly weighted through-ball down the inside left. Weidenfeller dashes off his line to narrow the angle, so the Argentinian attempts to square the ball to Edin Dzeko. His pass is intercepted by Neven Subotic, who plays it out of defence.  71 min: Borussia Dortmund substitution:Mats Hummels off, Felipe Santana on. Borussia Dortmund booking from 10 minutes ago that I haven&apos;t got around to mentioning yet: Jakub Blaszczykowski.  74 min: On the touchline, Mario Balotelli has been instructed to peel off his tracksuit and prepare for action.  76 min: With the outside of his right foot, Robert Lewandowski misses one of the easiest chances he&apos;ll ever be presented with. Latching on to a beautifully curled cross into his path from Ilkay Gundogan on the right flank and with Joe Hart at his mercy, he scuffed the ball wide of the left upright when scoring looked a far easier option. That&apos;s a dreadful miss.  79 min: Ilkay Gundogan goes down as if shot in the back under a challenge from Pablo Zabaleta and there&apos;s a minor skirmish between assorted players from both teams when City, quite correctly, decline to put the ball out of play so he can receive medical attention.  81 min: Manchester City substitution: Gael Clichy off, Mario Balotelli on. That&apos;s the last of City&apos;s three substitutes on now. Borussia Dortmund substitution: Ilkay Gundogan off, Kevin Grosskreutz on.  83 min: City are starting to look a bit clueless and out of ideas. They pretty much matched Borussia Dortmund chance for chance in the first half but have created very little since the break.  84 min: Nastasic lumps the ball forward into the Dortmund box from deep, trying to pick out Edin Dzeko. The visitors clear.  85 min: Yaya Toure is booked for a foul on Mario Gotze.  87 min: Good work by City, who create a decent chance after good link-up play by Mario Balotelli and Edin Dzeko down the right. Dzeko crosses into a crowded penalty area and picks out Sergio Aguero, but his on-target header is saved by Weidenfeller.  88 min: Penalty for Manchester City. Subotic is penalised for handball. On first view it looks a decidedly strange decision and one which quite a few referees might not have given.  GOAL! Manchester City 1-1 Borussia Dortmund (Balotelli 89pen) After completely ignoring Wedienfeller jabbering in his ear as he waited to take the spot-kick, Mario Balotelli takes his run-up, stops and then waits for the goalkeeper to dive towards one corner before nonchalantly rolling the ball into the other. He wheels way doing a yap-yap-yap lobster impression with one hand.  90 min: First Reus and then Lewandowski go close for Borussia Dortmund. The latter&apos;s effort forces another fine save out of Joe Hart. There&apos;ll be four minutes of injury time and this match could still go either way.  90+1 min: So, that penalty - having seen a replay I can confirm it was a shocking decision. Subotic was contesting the ball with Aguero, it bounced up, hit his arm and he was judged to have controlled it with his hand.  90+3 min: A foul by the substitute Santana gifts Manchester City a free-kick within shooting range for Kolarov, wide on the right. His effort is poor and fails to clear the first man.  Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! Referee Karlovec blows for full-time and draws the curtain down on a wonderfully entertaining match. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s unfair to say that Manchester City escaped from jail there, having been soundly thrashed in the second half. But for a generous decision from the referee, the heroics of their goalkeeper and the profligacy of Borussia Dortmund in front of goal, they could easily have lost by three or four.

While Makoko is largely self-sufficient, the entire community is served by a single primary school. Adeyemi&apos;s visit to the area in 2009 gave him the idea of building a floating settlement \u2013 starting with a floating school (video). As climate change pushes up sea levels and coastal erosion chips away at the shoreline, thousands of homes built along west Africa&apos;s densely populated coast are washed away each year. Each year, the tropical rains that lash Lagos overwhelm the colonial-era drainage system. During rainy seasons, fishermen sometimes canoe across roads sunk under floodwaters. How Africa&apos;s largest city reacts to the encroaching waters is a crucial test case for other countries. &quot;The big question is what will Lagos look like in 50 years&apos; time? Will we have a city that integrates water into its design, or will we have a city that tries to keep water out at any cost?&quot; said Janthomas Hiemstra, deputy country director for the UN Development Fund, as he stood on a floating platform like the one on which the proposed Makoko school could be built. It a question authorities are grappling with in the main city of a country whose current growth rate could push its population to 300 million within a quarter of a century. &quot;A floating school like this could be part of a vision for Lagos,&quot; said Hiemstra. Amid a torrential downpour, children and adults alike leap on to the platform, which is made of locally sourced wood and kept afloat by bright blue recycled plastic barrels. &quot;We looked at many ways of creating a building that would still be functional regardless of the water levels, and we decided the building should float,&quot; said Adeyemi, as the platform swayed gently in the waters. Under the plan, 16 such podiums would be lashed together to form the ground floor of the school. The proposed three-storey triangular structure would address some of the infrastructure problems that plague the communities in Lagos that live on the water, said Adeyemi. Solar panels would provide renewable energy; the sloping roof would enable rainwater to be harvested efficiently, and a waste-to-energy system would solve sanitation problems. Adeyemi added: &quot;The building can be adapted for other uses, such as homes or hospitals. Ultimately, it&apos;s a vision that can be used to sustainably develop [African] coastal communities.&quot; But the government is reluctant to embrace the idea of making permanent the dozen of settlements that crowd the city&apos;s waters. Periodic attempts to evict their inhabitants have been unsuccessful. &quot;The fact remains that [the Makoko] waterbody is the main natural drainage facility for Lagos state. People living there endanger not just themselves but the general citizens of the state,&quot; said the city&apos;s state planning commissioner, Toyin Ayinde. &quot;We&apos;re trying to see how [water communities] can keep some activities on the water, but the idea is for them to live on the land. There&apos;s more to our shoreline protection than just putting cities on water.&quot; Nevertheless, the floating school project has received tentative backing from local authorities, and Ayinde admitted that proposals for houses on water could still be part of a wider vision. Not everyone living on the water wants to leave. A Makoko fisherman, Boyo Shemede, said: &quot;I was born on these waters. If we leave the water, we will still be alive but we will never be truly happy. What we really want is for the government to help us with sanitation.&quot; In recent years, Lagos has begun exploiting its waters. More than 1 million Lagosians now use some form of water transport each month, and the city&apos;s waterfront ministry has welcomed private investment in projects, such as the construction of Eko Atlantic city, on the southern tip of Lagos. Unlike Makoko, the new district, which is being constructed in the wealthier part of the city, will have modern water, sanitation, transport and security systems. Each day, workers fill a strip of reclaimed land with sand pumped from the ocean floor. Eko Atlantic&apos;s developer plan to turn the reclaimed land into a gleaming new city, surrounded by an 8km protective wall against the Atlantic surge. City officials say its tree-lined streets would house 250,000 people, roughly the same number as Makoko. &quot;It&apos;s the first time a project with reclaimed land has been done on this scale. Nobody knows if it will actually work,&quot; said an official. &quot;On the other hand, if it works, it shows that Lagos can be a waterfront city and a beautiful city at the same time.&quot; Meanwhile, the UNDP remains keen on getting plans for the Makoko floating settlement off the ground. &quot;What&apos;s happening at the moment \u2013 and this is a phenomenon not only in Nigeria \u2013 is that a lot of governments are trying to do something about the effects of sea erosion. That is reactive, and that&apos;s good,&quot; said Hiemstra. &quot;But on the other hand, that money and effort could be better directed if we knew what we were after in the long term, rather than just dousing the fires. &quot;The future of Lagos has to incorporate [water-based] communities; you cannot just think them away.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;Like everybody passing over [Lagos city&apos;s] Third Mainland Bridge, I became interested in Makoko,&quot; said Kunle Adeyemi, a Nigerian architect who is based in the waterside city of Amsterdam."], "title": "Nigeria floats solution for life on the water | Monica Mark", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/04/nigeria-floats-idea-for-life-on-water", "tags": ["Environment", "Africa", "Global development", "Urbanisation", "World news", "Climate change", "Cities", "Cities and development", "Nigeria", "Flooding", "Sanitation"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-04T16:35:09Z", "article": "As Real Madrid prepare for Sunday&apos;s Cl\u00e1sico against Barcelona, they suddenly find themselves with a new weapon in midfield.

Cherry-picking from the world&apos;s greatest musicians could result in an all-conquering super-orchestra. At the Royal Festival Hall recently, there was a glimpse of what could be, when the London Philharmonic joined forces with the Russian National Orchestra, under Vladimir Jurowski, for barnstorming performances of Tchaikovsky&apos;s 1812 Overture and Shostakovich&apos;s Leningrad\u00a0Symphony. The playing was spectacular. Sparks flew. The LPO&apos;s warmth and precision dovetailed with the blazing intensity and commitment of the Russian players \u2013 making a greater performance than either could have achieved\u00a0alone. Why doesn&apos;t this sort of thing happen more often? If you could fuse, say, the London Symphony with the Berlin Philharmonic, you might end up with the world&apos;s greatest orchestra \u2013 an ensemble capable of sight-reading any 20th- or 21st-century score, as the LSO do so dazzlingly; but also blessed with the warmth and fire of the Berlin Phil&apos;s sound. Imagine what such an uber-orchestra&apos;s could do with Mahler. Or how about the steely power of the Chicago Symphony mashed up with the sensuous sensitivity of Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw? That&apos;s a\u00a0Rite of Spring I want to hear. It&apos;s not just about whole orchestras, however. The Vienna Philharmonic&apos;s peerless wind soloists would instantly give any orchestra some echt-Viennese lilt and melancholy; or drop in the brazen brilliance of the New York Phil&apos;s brass section for a dose of American glamour. And as for a conductor? Well, naturally, in fantasy-orchestra-fantasy-land, you would have your pick of everyone from Valery Gergiev to Mariss Jansons, from Gustavo Dudamel to Simon Rattle. Personally, I&apos;d want Claudio Abbado, but that&apos;s probably just me. One cliche about today&apos;s orchestral music just isn&apos;t true: the idea that, in an age of musical globalisation, every orchestra is starting to sound the same, that national and regional differences are somehow being ironed out. Rubbish. There&apos;s enough diversity of sound and interpretation to satisfy any number of fantasy leagues.

The dawn raid at the Kunsthal museum in the Netherlands&apos; second largest city was described by police as a well-planned and bold operation. Security experts speculated that the thieves might have taken advantage of Rotterdam&apos;s port \u2013 one of the largest in the world \u2013 to swiftly move the paintings abroad. While police were reluctant to put a price tag on the stolen paintings, experts said it ran into tens of millions of pounds. One security expert described the museum, designed by the star Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, as a &quot;gem of a gallery&quot;, but a &quot;nightmare to protect&quot;, and suggested that thieves spent months plotting the robbery. The works were named by the museum&apos;s management on Tuesday afternoon, as Pablo Picasso&apos;s Harlequin Head; Henri Matisse&apos;s Reading Girl in White and Yellow; Claude Monet&apos;s Waterloo Bridge, London, and Charing Cross Bridge, London; Paul Gauguin&apos;s Girl in Front of Open Window, De Haan&apos;s Self-Portrait and Freud&apos;s Woman with Eyes Closed. The Picasso was the best known work. Jop Ubbens, the general director of Christie&apos;s in Amsterdam, told the Dutch daily newspaper De Volkskrant the paintings were worth &quot;far more than just a few million euros&quot;. He declined to give a more exact estimate, saying he had not seen the paintings. &quot;They could be worth \u20ac50m or more,&quot; he said, pointing out that a work of Monet&apos;s brought almost \u20ac52m at auction four years ago, the highest amount ever paid for a French impressionist painting. Ubbens did not rule out that the paintings had been &quot;stolen to order&quot; by an art collector, &quot;in which case they could be hanging on a wall somewhere by now, never to be seen again.&quot; Alternatively he said, they might have been stolen for ransom. &quot;For example, the thieves might ask for a million euros for the return of the Matisse,&quot; he told the paper. He said the idea that the thieves would try to sell the paintings on the open market was unlikely. &quot;That would be a really stupid idea. They are so well known, no one would touch them,&quot; Ubbens said. The works were immediately listed on the Art Loss Register which helps trace stolen works of art, and makes the chance of selling them on harder. Ubbens said the De Haan was the least well-known work, but suggested that as it resembled a Matisse, &quot;it might have been stolen by mistake&quot;. The works were showing as part of an exhibition at the Kunsthal opened to mark its 20th anniversary. Called Avant-Gardes, the exhibition, which opened just over a week ago and was due to run until 20 January, consisted of 150 works from the Triton Foundation Collection, a collection assembled by the Cordia family which made its money in oil and shipping and is ranked among the richest families in the Netherlands. The gallery&apos;s curators described the exhibition as the first public showing of the &quot;carefully and lovingly assembled Triton collection&quot;, which had developed an &quot;international reputation&quot; and comprised &quot;representative works by the most important and influential artists of the late nineteenth century to the present day&quot;. It also includes works by Piet Mondrian, Marcel Duchamp, Vincent van Gogh, Georges Braque and Willem de Kooning. The gallery was closed until further notice as forensic experts scoured it for clues about the thefts. A short message on the gallery&apos;s website informed visitors: &quot;Due to the theft which occurred in the Kunsthal Rotterdam last night, the Kunsthal is closed to the public today.&quot; Security expert Ton Cremers said that it had become easier than ever for thieves to steal paintings even from well-protected galleries like the Kunsthal. He said some of the fault lay with its design. Calling the Kunsthal a wonderful museum, it was a nightmare from a security point of view: &quot;As a gallery it is a gem. But it is an awful building to have to protect. If you hold your face up to the window at the back you have a good view of the paintings, which makes it all too easy for thieves to plot taking them from the walls,&quot; he told De Volkskrant.", "sentences": ["Jop Ubbens, the general director of Christie&apos;s in Amsterdam, told the Dutch daily newspaper De Volkskrant the paintings were worth &quot;far more than just a few million euros&quot;."], "title": "Rotterdam art thieves take valuable paintings in dawn heist", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/16/rotterdam-art-thieves-valuable-paintings", "tags": ["Art theft", "Art", "Art and design", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news", "Pablo Picasso", "Paul Gauguin", "Henri Matisse", "Lucian Freud", "Claude Monet"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-17T09:35:28Z", "article": "David Silva will have a scan on Thursday morning to determine whether he will be able to play in Manchester City&apos;s visit to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday after limping out of Spain&apos;s 1-1 draw with France in a World Cup qualifier on Tuesday evening.

The Anglo-Dutch group blamed a 3% drop in sales volumes on the economic slowdown in Europe. A spokesman explained that cash-strapped consumers were not moving house, and not fixing dents in their cars to save money. The Amsterdam-based company acquired the Dulux brand - famous for its shaggy-haired dog ads - when it took over ICI in 2008. On Thursday it wrote down the value of its decorative paints division by \u20ac2.5bn (\u00a32bn), resulting in a net loss of \u20ac2.4bn for the third quarter. Europe accounted for the majority of the writedown, \u20ac1.9bn, with another \u20ac400m written down in North America and \u20ac200m in South America. Decorative paints generated revenues of \u20ac1.46bn, little changed from a year earlier. The tough market in Europe and Latin America was largely offset by strong performances in China and northern Asia. Even so, AkzoNobel has been able to hold on to or increase its market share in most of its markets. The company&apos;s finance chief, Keith Nichols, said: &quot;The principal concern remains the decorative paint markets in Europe. The impairment taken in this quarter is a reflection of these concerns and our realistic assessment of the markets going forward. As we cannot expect quick recovery of the economy, we also will continue to implement our ongoing improvement agenda in order to increase our profitability.&quot; The firm&apos;s chief executive, Ton B\u00fcchner, has been on medical leave and is expected to return to work around the end of the year. Berenberg analyst Jaideep Pandya said: &quot;With the \u20ac2.4bn write-down, Akzo Nobel has now cleared almost all of its goodwill linked to decorative coatings. One could see this as a fresh start for Mr B\u00fcchner or the acceptance of reality by the company with regard to the current state of its paint markets.&quot;", "sentences": ["The Amsterdam-based company acquired the Dulux brand - famous for its shaggy-haired dog ads - when it took over ICI in 2008."], "title": "Dulux-maker writes down value of paints division amid euro crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/18/dulux-akzonobel-paint-division", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Europe", "World news", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-18T14:00:02Z", "article": "The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) was born from the broad and market-led premise that corporate reporting should be brought into line with the needs of the 21st century. The global financial crisis means that the world must consider the consequences of living beyond its means for too long \u2013 both economically and environmentally \u2013 and focus on what changes need to be brought about. It is often during times of extreme uncertainty and turbulence that new innovative ideas are formulated \u2013 and with that in mind the IIRC, chaired by Mervyn King, is forging ahead with developing the first internationally accepted framework that will enable businesses to put in place more sustainable systems and processes. Just as governments are exploring whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a full expression of a nation&apos;s wellbeing and influencing the policy decisions that flow from it, so too businesses are starting to innovate in the way they account for, measure, manage and disclose non-financial as well as financial, factors. Integrated Reporting (IR), draws all of these elements together. Change is not likely to occur overnight \u2013 governments, regulators, standard setters and stock exchange listing authorities will move at different speeds towards establishing guidance and principles for integrating reporting process and practices. But it is clear that companies should view their responsibilities not as a regulatory burden but as a way of attracting long term investment. The IIRC reporting framework will offer guiding principles to businesses formulating their corporate reports, and the support it has received has been extremely encouraging. Does IR mean longer reports? Reactions to the instigation of a new reporting system can lead to the conclusion that reports will become even longer. However, integrated reporting isn&apos;t about more reporting but about doing it better. IR is also not part of the new strand of thought that focuses on environmental sustainability, (although this would be incorporated) but about presenting a clear, concise report that ensures investors and other stakeholders have access to relevant information about how business is creating and preserving value in the short, medium and long term. This will mean the breaking down of silos within organisations and allow for integrated thinking. Underpinning IR is the understanding that financial statements, management commentary, governance and remuneration and sustainability reporting are all interdependent. Developing the framework In June the IIRC was among the many organisations represented at the Rio+20 Earth Summit. We were pressing governments to put in place policy mechanisms to enable the accurate measurement of natural capital, so that businesses could begin to manage their use of precious natural resources and integrate this information into corporate reporting cycles. The IIRC are acutely aware, that for tangible change to occur it must be market-led and businesses, investors, accounting bodies and trade associations need to forge the way. One of the most encouraging aspects of the Rio process was the degree to which the private sector was actively pressing for these bolder solutions \u2013 more so than had originally been on the table. The IIRC is a collaboration between businesses, investors, standard setters, regulators and the accounting profession to accelerate IR. In October 2011, the IIRC initiated a pilot programme to support the development of the framework. The programme, which was concluded with a conference for its business and 25 member-investor networks in Amsterdam, is made up of more than 78 global corporate and public sector reporting organisations, including the likes of Unilever, China Light and Power Holdings Ltd and Microsoft. Pilot programme organisations directly provide real-time insights as well as highlighting potential challenges in developing the framework. Different countries are clearly at different stages with diverse obligations to reporting regulators. It is encouraging then, that the businesses above have been forming their own national and regional groups so that similarities and cultural viewpoints can be conveyed back to the IIRC secretariat \u2013 and we can understand the journey certain countries need to embark on. The benefits of IR for businesses are plentiful \u2013 it focuses the organisation on its future orientation and creating value through the business model. However, the main audience for IR is the investor. In recent times, investor decision-making has become short-term and fast-paced. The average time that US institutional investors hold stock in a particular company has fallen from seven years to seven months in the space of a generation. This has led to market instability and has a distorting effect on business decision-making. The instigation of IR would be a powerful tool for investors and would install a culture of transparency, reliability and stability so that investors can begin to trust their money to longer term investments. The framework will be revised and adapted to fit the needs of multiple stakeholder requirements and will be open to public consultation for 90 days in the second quarter of 2013. Version 1.0 will be released in December 2013 once this feedback has been received and processed. From there the IIRC will move into the implantation phase to drive forward the IR framework.

But 15 years after his death in 1997, the man whose music was a constant thorn in the side of officials in his native Nigeria has been honoured by the authorities with whom he so often tangled. The Kalakuta commune \u2013 a three-storey building down a potholed road that &quot;seceded&quot; from Nigeria \u2013 has been turned into a museum with the help of a $250,000 (\u00a3156,000) grant from the Lagos government. &quot;The Afrobeat movement is going stronger,&quot; his son Femi Kuti said as visitors streamed through the house in downtown Lagos. &quot;More people are aware about what my father stood for \u2026 and the plight of the ordinary African. That&apos;s why we have to keep fighting for a just society for everybody.&quot; Femi, whose own music has won him countless awards, says the museum is not a sign that the Kuti family&apos;s attitude towards the authorities has softened. But any form of government endorsement would have been unthinkable in the 1970s, when Fela created Afrobeat \u2013 a blend of traditional Yoruba music laced with jazz, brass sounds and stinging political messages that made him the constant target of government beatings, harassment and jailings.     A mural in the Kalakuta museum to Fela Kuti. Photograph: Akintunde Akinleye/Reuters    Gone is the three-metre electrified barbed-wire fence erected after soldiers razed the building. That attack, in which his mother was thrown from a window, followed the release of his hit song Zombie, in which he railed against government soldiers who &quot;no go think unless you tell am to think&quot;. Another son of Fela Kuti, Seun, said before a performance this week: &quot;The message of Afrobeat is so strong that guys who have nothing to do with Afrobeat are now latching on to the name just to sell their records today. &quot;But the movement is unstoppable. You have white teenagers in Amsterdam who are playing Afrobeat today. Afrobeat is going beyond Africa.&quot; Fela&apos;s popularity grew when he began singing about local realities as Nigerians experienced rising levels of poverty despite a stream of petrodollars flowing into the country after Nigeria gained independence in 1960. Twenty years later, absolute poverty had doubled to 30% of the population. &quot;Everything he sang about is still true today,&quot; said Oluwole, a taxi driver waiting for petrol as a tape played Fela on a tinny loop. &quot;Look how we have to queue for fuel. How can a country that sends oil to America not have enough oil for its own citizens?&quot; His music still resonates with an army of fans ranging from street hustlers to ageing academics. This week, thousands flocked to the annual week-long Felabration, one of Africa&apos;s wildest parties, fuelled by music and copious amounts of weed and cold beer. &quot;If you don&apos;t want government to catch you, make sure you thief big big like them,&quot; one performer said in pidgin English, eliciting cheers and foot-stamping loud enough to rattle the corrugated iron roof of the rebuilt Shrine \u2013 Fela&apos;s famous nightclub \u2013 one afternoon this week. Fela&apos;s ability to inspire mass protests meant he was feared even by visiting presidents. But his rejection of both Christianity and Islam, his legendary sexual appetite and his fondness for turnip-sized joints (funk bassist Bootsy Collins once exclaimed after a visit to Nigeria: &quot;Man, we walked into the room and the smoke knocked us down. I mean, we were the James Brown band but we were totally wiped out!&quot;) made him a pariah to many in a highly religious society.

More than 50m people have played the social music game across iOS, Android and Facebook since its launch in May 2012, and the game currently has 20m monthly active players. Those figures come from Mathieu Nouzareth, chief executive of SongPop&apos;s developer FreshPlanet. He was speaking at the Amsterdam Dance Event conference about SongPop&apos;s success so far, and its plans for the future. The game involves guessing song clips as they play, as quickly as possible, then challenging friends to guess them faster, like a musical version of Zynga&apos;s Draw Something \u2013\u00a0one of the other big mobile/social hits of 2012. Around 50% of SongPop&apos;s traffic comes from the US, with the UK its second most popular market according to Nouzareth, who added that 68% of the game&apos;s players are women, and 32% men. FreshPlanet has spent &quot;almost nothing&quot; on marketing, with its growth coming from a mix of word-of-mouth, app store promotions, positive reviews and a glowing recommendation by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the social network earlier this year. Nouzareth said that SongPop has two key groups of players: teenagers and young adults who are guessing today&apos;s hits; and older players who are guessing the music from their own youth. &quot;We have a lot of mothers playing with daughters too,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s becoming a tool for generations to play with one another, and maybe have the daughter discover the music the mother likes, and the other way around.&quot; FreshPlanet is keen to work more closely with the music industry on SongPop. One example: the company has just launched an in-game promotion for Carrie Underwood&apos;s upcoming tour, which includes a playlist devoted to her music. It&apos;s the first of a planned series of artist-branded playlists, which will end with full-screen interstitial ads helping fans follow the artists on Facebook and Twitter, or linking through to iTunes, YouTube, Spotify and ticketing services. SongPop also shows iTunes links to players after every round of the game. &quot;We&apos;re driving a significant amount of traffic to iTunes directly,&quot; said Nouzareth. &quot;We&apos;ve become one of the largest iTunes affiliates in the world today\u2026 We&apos;re driving a huge number of clicks: close to a few hundred thousand every day.&quot; Some music industry executives have wondered about how (or even whether) FreshPlanet is paying licensing fees for the music used in SongPop. Nouzareth said the game currently streams around 300m music clips every day. Although players guess songs in 2.7 seconds on average, there are still royalties to be paid to labels and publishers. &quot;We have licences with the big labels and publishers, and we pay them,&quot; said Nouzareth. &quot;There is this urban myth that if you use a small clip, you don&apos;t have to pay anything, but it&apos;s not true.&quot; He also talked about the future for SongPop. &quot;We think we&apos;ve just scratched the surface in what we can do combining a game and music,&quot; he said. Coming soon will be updates boosting the music discovery features for SongPop. Nouzareth showed a screenshot of the next version of the game, which will display Spotify and YouTube links for individual songs as well as iTunes links. FreshPlanet is also looking to increase the social aspects within SongPop itself. &quot;The feedback we have from players is they want to make new friends who like the same kinds of music genres they like,&quot; said Nouzareth. That means the game will start matching people with other players near their location who share their music tastes, alongside the existing Facebook connections. &quot;We&apos;re not turning it into a dating service, per se,&quot; he stressed. SongPop currently has three main revenue streams: in-game ads in the free version; sales of the ad-free paid version; and in-app purchases for virtual currency used to unlock new playlists and help on unknown songs (similar to the 50:50 lifeline in Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?) FreshPlanet has more plans. &quot;We are also launching a new subsciption model: it&apos;s called the VIP subscription model, and you&apos;ll have access to exclusive content if you subscribe on a monthly basis,&quot; said Nouzareth. The biggest challenge for FreshPlanet, though, is how to keep growing. Nouzareth was asked during his presentation what he&apos;s learned from the very public growing pains of Draw Something. Social games analytics service AppData \u2013\u00a0which only counts players who&apos;ve connected SongPop to Facebook \u2013\u00a0indicates that the game has been gently sliding downwards over the last month in terms of monthly and daily active users. Is there a danger that the game has peaked, and is about to decline? &quot;I think we are very different from Draw Something,&quot; said Nouzareth when questioned at ADE on this point.  &quot;The emotional link people have to music is very strong, probably stronger than just a drawing. Building a social network and adding more music discovery is designed to address this issue. We are building a community of music lovers, and we hope they are going to stay in the game for a very long time.&quot;", "sentences": ["He was speaking at the Amsterdam Dance Event conference about SongPop&apos;s success so far, and its plans for the future."], "title": "SongPop has 20m active players and streams 300m music clips a day", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/oct/19/songpop-success-ade", "tags": ["Apps", "Games", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "Mobile", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Media", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-19T16:07:00Z", "article": "@gopaldass \u2013 Abhay Adhikari Abhay is a digital engagement specialist for the arts and we were fortunate enough to have him here at Guardian HQ this week for two digital skills seminars on communicating and campaigning with social media.

One of the key points for the Clinton campaign team then was the charge that President George Bush Sr was soft on taxing big business. Clinton bragged that, given the chance, he could collect an additional \u00a345bn in tax from foreign multinationals in just four years. This very week in 1992, his campaign started a blitz of 30-second TV adverts. Viewers were told: &quot;This is the $825bn question. That&apos;s how much foreign corporations operating in the US took in one year. But 72% of them didn&apos;t pay a dime in taxes. Not one dime \u2026&quot; While he never quite clawed back \u00a345bn, many felt Clinton put his finger on an important issue. Yet two decades on, US senator Carl Levin could still claim recently that multinationals &quot;engage in shams and gimmicks to avoid paying the taxes they owe&quot;. And that was the charge levelled at Starbucks UK last week, which became the latest target of fury, following Amazon and Google, for paying derisory levels of tax in the UK. A Reuters investigation uncovered apparent discrepancies between what Starbucks was telling US investors on the one hand and what it was declaring to HM Revenue &amp; Customs on the other. By a curious coincidence Starbucks and Britain&apos;s home-grown competitor, Costa Coffee, achieved similar sales last year \u2013 \u00a3398m and \u00a3377m respectively. The cost of achieving these sales, however, was \u00a3319m at Starbucks, more than three times the cost recorded by Costa. As a consequence, Costa&apos;s accounts show a tax charge of \u00a315m, while no tax is charged against Starbucks&apos; loss-making UK division. That gap is in part explained by the US firm sourcing roasted coffee from a sister company in the Netherlands, and a consequent requirement to allocate some profits from the UK back to Amsterdam. Costa, meanwhile, operates a roastery in south London. More unsettling, however, is the payment of almost \u00a326m in &quot;royalties and licence fees&quot; by Starbucks UK in 2011 to other parts of the group. Engskov has defended this by pointing out that royalties are levied at the same percentage of revenues everywhere Starbucks operates in the world. Significantly, however, he does not say whether these payments are made back to Seattle or to a low-tax haven. Royalties are not unusual:\u00a0such payments are also levied on McDonald&apos;s UK and Walmart-owned Asda by their parent companies. What sets them apart from Starbucks, however, is that they remain big UK tax contributors after the payments are made. By contrast, Engskov looks to be struggling to make the case that Starbucks UK is serious about building profits, or that its royalty and licensing arrangements are directed to that goal. Pre-tax charges on the business have been a significant reason that the exchequer has been able to collect just \u00a38.3m since Starbucks came to the UK in 1998, despite sales of more than \u00a33bn in that period. On Friday, Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz spoke for the first time about the allegations, when cornered \u2013 again by Reuters \u2013 at the opening of the group&apos;s first store in India. In placatory mood, he said: &quot;We will absolutely comply with any government inquiry with transparency and respect.&quot; As clear a signal as any, surely, that he would turn up to give an account to a parliamentary committee if asked. Surely it would be churlish now for MPs not to take him at his word, and demand a clear explanation from Starbucks and the other multinationals that, at first glance at least, appear to be gaming Britain&apos;s tax system? An alliance with the Kremlin? Be careful what you wish for, BP The future&apos;s bright, the future&apos;s Igor Sechin: that could be the motto for BP&apos;s latest adventure in Russia. The details are still being thrashed out, but BP is set to sell its 50% holding in TNK-BP, Russia&apos;s third largest oil producer, to Rosneft. It will receive a pile of cash ($10bn-$15bn) plus a 10%-20% stake in Rosneft \u2013 the national oil champion and a company led by Sechin, ally of President Putin. The appeal of Sechin and Rosneft is easy to understand: they are powerful. Sechin has been the Kremlin guiding hand shaping Russia&apos;s energy industry in recent years. Rosneft, if it ends up swallowing 100% of TNK-BP, will control half the country&apos;s oil output and be the world&apos;s largest producer. By contrast, the TNK-BP joint venture has descended into instability in the past four years. The oligarchs at AAR, owners of the other 50% of the company, have been prickly partners. There have been rows over strategy and dividends, and BP chief Bob Dudley, when he was the firm&apos;s man in Moscow, was obliged to flee Russia for a time in 2008. So, you might think, saying goodbye to AAR and embracing Rosneft is entirely sensible. What&apos;s not to like? Here&apos;s the drawback. TNK-BP, for all the strife, has been a wonderful investment for BP. The UK company invested $8bn in 2003 and has harvested $19bn in dividends, thanks in part to upgrades of management and infrastructure. By contrast, Rosneft is seen as bureaucratic, inefficient and lacking commercial nous. The Kremlin owns 75% of the shares and has seen their value flatline for half a decade. The hope, naturally, is that an alliance with BP marks the moment when Rosneft becomes serious about operational efficiencies. But, if it were that easy, the company would be further down the track already. In reality, BP probably has no choice but to run with Rosneft and tie up a amount of capital in an investment it cannot easily exit. But it&apos;s a gamble and the true odds on long-term success are unclear. That&apos;s Russia, where the truism that oil is really about politics applies in spades. Knight errant After spending the entire financial crisis serving as the public face of the most hated industry in Britain \u2013 the banks \u2013 you might think Angela Knight would have sought out a job as the spokeswoman for fluffy kittens, say, or sunshine. Instead, the ex-Tory MP and staunch defender of free markets popped up last week in her latest role, as chief executive of Energy UK, the body set up to boost the image of another group of unloveable profiteers \u2014 the Big Six energy suppliers. With their byzantine tariff structures and useless call centres, the energy firms give even the banks a run for their money. And David Cameron&apos;s populist pledge to force them to put customers on cheaper deals exposed the fact that even the Conservatives think this is a market that&apos;s failing its consumers. As Knight defended the actions of the banks at the height of the crisis, when their bosses were nowhere to be seen, it was almost possible to feel sorry for a woman who had joined the British Bankers&apos; Association in early 2007, before the scale of malpractice became clear. But this time around, she knows exactly what she&apos;s walking into. Either Knight is a masochist, or she&apos;s one of the few people who believe that the utilities \u2013 and the banks \u2013 are great British business champions.

Thrown into the action with 11 minutes remaining, at a point when Manchester City were down to 10 men and facing their first Premier League defeat of the season, Dzeko turned this fascinating game on its head with an equaliser 87 seconds after replacing Gareth Barry before coolly dispatching the winner in injury-time. It was a stunning contribution from the substitute and is becoming something of a habit for a man who has scored five of his six goals this season from the bench, including the winner at Fulham in the previous league match. David Platt, City&apos;s assistant manager, acknowledged the significance as well as the number of goals that the Bosnian has scored for the club since his \u00a327m arrival from Wolfsburg in January last year while Vincent Kompany, whose error contributed to James Milner&apos;s early dismissal for a professional foul on Shane Long, tweeted &quot;the big man proved his worth again&quot;. Dzeko, however, appears to be getting tired of some of the praise, in particular the back-handed compliment that he is a game-changer to call on when City are up against it. &quot;I was never a super sub before I came to City. I used to play always from the beginning and I scored a lot of goals not as a sub,&quot; Dzeko said. &quot;In the last few games it&apos;s a situation like this and I am just happy I am scoring goals. But I will never be a super sub. I want to play.&quot; It is easy to understand Dzeko&apos;s frustration. Eight of his 11 appearances this season have been as a substitute and he has completed 90 minutes only once in the Premier League. Yet Dzeko has five league goals to his name, which is as many as City&apos;s other three forwards, Carlos Tevez, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Mario Balotelli, have managed between them. Those goals have come at an average of one every 46 minutes and he could be forgiven for wondering what damage he could do if he was given a decent run in the team. &quot;Of course [it&apos;s frustrating to watch from the bench], everyone wants to be there all the time, especially when you score,&quot; Dzeko said. &quot;But I&apos;m there when the team needs [me] and, even if I only played 10 minutes, I was ready to give everything to try and change the score. When you get 10-15 minutes, you can&apos;t be sad or angry with the coach. You just have to play your game and do your best. That is in my mind always.&quot; He is certainly entitled to believe that he has made a strong enough case to start against Ajax on Wednesday, when City need to win in the Amsterdam Arena to keep alive realistic hopes of qualifying for the knockout stage of the Champions League. Hard as Tevez worked against West Bromwich Albion, he has now gone seven games without scoring while Balotelli was a danger to his own team at times here, the Italian&apos;s lack of discipline undermining the efforts of a side that played like champions as they made light of their numerical disadvantage. Ahead through Long&apos;s opportunist goal in the 67th minute, Albion were left to reflect on what Ben Foster described as a &quot;brutal finish&quot; to the game. Romelu Lukaku, the Albion substitute, squandered two decent chances either side of an overhead kick that Joe Hart tipped over, while at the other end Dzeko ruthlessly punished some suspect defending, heading in the first before sweeping home Ag\u00fcero&apos;s wonderfully weighted pass for the second. &quot;The first goal was a horrible one,&quot; said Foster, who was caught in no man&apos;s land as he tried to punch clear Tevez&apos;s inswinging free-kick. &quot;It was a great ball in, to be fair. I thought I&apos;d come and get something on it and, once you are on your way, you kind of think: &apos;Shit, here we go.&apos; I should have stayed on my line. The second one, it&apos;s credit to us that we are trying to win the game against Man City. We are giving it a go at least.

Local authorities, most without any history of public health management, will take over responsibility for improving the health of local populations. Money currently spent on the delivery of drug, alcohol and sexual health services will contribute about 60% of the funding. But, as of April 2013, money previously ringfenced for those services will be lumped together with money for other public health services. No one really knows how clinical commissioning groups, responsible for commissioning local services, and local\u00a0health and wellbeing boards will work together. There are fears that, with\u00a0an emphasis on localism, access to\u00a0drug and alcohol services could suffer. Will councillors turn their backs on electorally unpopular services? Or will it lead to joined-up locally led responses that address issues across sectors and tackle the determinants of health and wellbeing? When galvanised by political will, cities act quicker and more comprehensively than governments. With the identification of Aids in the mid-1980s, several cities in the UK and overseas, including Liverpool, San Francisco and Amsterdam, swiftly provided condoms and syringes to high-risk populations. In Liverpool, the Mersey harm reduction model involved the NHS, communities, primary care, police, church leaders, drug users and sex workers. It led to one of the first needle exchanges in the UK, extensive outreach and an expansion of drug treatment. Cities can also deliver public health prevention. Community-based alcohol projects of the kind implemented in Glasgow, Birmingham and Cardiff can reduce alcohol-related problems. The projects work best when there is a range of local actions that change the drinking environment, such as promoting responsible serving of alcohol in bars and shops, training bar staff, enforcing licensing laws, and working with transport and fast-food outlets (often a source of friction late at night). In\u00a0Stockholm, community involvement, bar staff training and stricter enforcement of existing alcohol laws has led to a 29% decrease in violent crimes. But cities can also get it wrong. In Vancouver&apos;s Downtown Eastside, large numbers of drug users with serious physical, mental and social problems were concentrated into an area the size of six blocks, with little or no services. In the UK, the regeneration of inner cities has concentrated bars and clubs into small areas, with competition for customers leading to unhealthy drinking incentives, overcrowding, lack of public toilets, and large numbers of people leaving at the same time and vying for scarce transport. Cities need to bring together expertise and powers across local planning, policing, licensing, urban design and transport, and environmental and public health in order to reduce alcohol-related issues. The changes being ushered in for public health provide huge potential to both maintain and improve alcohol, drug and sexual health services, and also to develop truly integrated responses. The evidence is in \u2013 we would be foolish to ignore it as English public health takes its first steps towards a new brave world. \u2022 Professor Gerry Stimson is former executive director of the International Harm Reduction Association and director of Knowledge-Action-Change, co-organiser, with the London Drug and Alcohol Policy Forum, of the City Health 2012 conference", "sentences": ["With the identification of Aids in the mid-1980s, several cities in the UK and overseas, including Liverpool, San Francisco and Amsterdam, swiftly provided condoms and syringes to high-risk populations."], "title": "Drugs and alcohol spending must not lose out", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/23/drugs-alcohol-spending-not-lose-out", "tags": ["Alcohol", "Drugs", "Health", "Public services policy", "Society", "Drugs policy", "Politics", "Health policy"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-23T14:38:52Z", "article": "The first rule of pro-choice: trust women. That applies to activism as much as abortion itself. Whether the aim is to serve an individual or a whole nation, the first thing you do is listen, carefully and attentively, to whoever you&apos;re trying to help. That&apos;s true when you&apos;re campaigning inside your own country, but even more so when the situation is complicated by the historical scar of colonialism: can you speak with women in other countries without taking their voices from them? A boat belonging to the Dutch group Women on Waves attempted to dock in Morocco this month. Women on Waves campaigns internationally for liberalised abortion laws and promotes helplines that advise on procuring your own medical abortion. It also uses its sea vessels as floating surgeries, performing medical abortions in international water for women whose home state criminalises the procedure. In Morocco, it seems that WoW picked a good target: the country has some of the most stringent anti-abortion legislation in the world. Abortion is only available in the first six weeks of pregnancy, and if a woman&apos;s life, physical or mental health is in jeopardy; there&apos;s no exemption for rape or incest, and a woman must have the consent of her husband \u2013 which assumes, of course, both that all sexually active women are married, and that a man should have the deciding voice in what happens to a woman&apos;s body. The boat met fierce opposition, both from the Moroccan government, which closed the port of Smir to prevent WoW from landing, and from protesters who gathered at the harbour side to express their disgust at abortion itself. &quot;We cannot accept these values, the values of massacre,&quot; said one \u2013 apparently oblivious to the fact that abortion, though illegal in Morocco, is still &quot;quite widespread&quot; according to the UN, and routinely deadly for the women resorting to unlicensed providers. But does it really help Moroccan women if the medical treatment they need is presented as something that sails in from Amsterdam, rather than something they choose and obtain for themselves? I&apos;m dubious. You might compare the Moroccan case to that of Uruguay, which has just become one of the very few Latin American countries to decriminalise abortion. The new legislation is still shockingly strict \u2013 the need to convince a panel of three experts, and a compulsory five-day &quot;period of reflection&quot; before the procedure are the kind of things Nadine Dorries wouldn&apos;t dare dream of. Yet compared to the rest of Latin America, this is an unparalleled feminist triumph. And it&apos;s been achieved, not through tugboat lobbying, but through the undramatic democratic processes of public will and political compromise. Will Uruguay&apos;s new law lead to a transformation of abortion rights throughout Latin America? Initially, no: the law is designed to be parochial, with abortion only available to Uruguayan citizens or women who have been resident for one year. But in the longer term, this geographical narrowness could be the impetus for adjacent counties to change their policy. If Uruguay were to become, in the words of the law&apos;s author Ivan Posada, &quot;a place that attracts people from other countries for this procedure&quot;, it might find itself in the same place as England, Wales and Scotland are to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland: a liberal neighbour that risks supporting the hypocrisy of conservative countries by allowing them to export abortion. When Marie Stopes opened Northern Ireland&apos;s first ever private sexual health clinic in Belfast this month, a Pro-Life Campaign representative described it as &quot;[imposing] an abortion regime&quot;, somehow overlooking the fact that this clinic would be run by Belfast-born Dawn Purvis and adhere strictly to the law of Northern Ireland regarding termination. But it&apos;s not only anti-abortion campaigners who conspire in the idea of abortion as something from outside: Anna Carey, a pro-choice journalist from Dublin, says she&apos;s sometimes encountered a condescending attitude from pro-choice activists in the UK. &quot;I think the one thing that irritates Irish activists is when the situation here is presented abroad as being a simple &apos;the entire country is ruled by the church, oh, the poor helpless Irish downtrodden women&apos;,&quot; says Carey, &quot;when the reality is much more complex \u2026 Irish women have been campaigning for abortion rights for decades.&quot; Access to abortion is a vital human right, and one that should be available to every woman in her own country. When the geographically fortunate presume to patronise less liberal countries, there&apos;s a danger that we may simply entrench the anti-abortion position we seek to dislodge. The answer is to speak not for but with the women whose choices should be honoured by the nation they belong to.", "sentences": ["But does it really help Moroccan women if the medical treatment they need is presented as something that sails in from Amsterdam, rather than something they choose and obtain for themselves?"], "title": "Imposing a fight for abortion on other countries can backfire | Sarah Ditum", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/imposing-fight-for-abortion-other-countries", "tags": ["Abortion", "Health", "Women", "World news", "Uruguay", "Americas", "Morocco", "Ireland", "Northern Ireland", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-23T19:34:00Z", "article": "&quot;Frustrating,&quot; was the word Roberto Mancini used from his seat in the bowels of the Amsterdam Arena. The Manchester City manager had just been asked about his team&apos;s difficulties in the Champions League and how, only two games in, they were suddenly confronted with a match they simply dare not lose. Would another bad result be the end for another year? &quot;We cannot think this way,&quot; Mancini replied. &quot;We have to win and then talk.&quot; This is the reality, however, of City&apos;s visit to the Netherlands and where they stand in Group D, third from bottom with only a solitary point from two fixtures and more shots conceded, 57 in two games, than anyone else in this season&apos;s competition. OK, when the opposition are Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund there are mitigating circumstances, but that does not alter the fact it has left them vulnerable again. &quot;Worrying&quot; was another word Mancini could have used. At the very least City will need four points from back-to-back games against Ajax, but it may even be that only two wins will do given that the following assignment is against Real Madrid before the group concludes against the Dortmund side that played with so much flair and penetration at the Etihad this month. Too negative? Vincent Kompany certainly thought so. &quot;We can lose our chance,&quot; Mancini admitted, but City&apos;s captain was not willing to entertain the idea, nor turn it into a discussion about City&apos;s struggles adapting to the competition they crave the most in Abu Dhabi. &quot;The past is irrelevant. We can&apos;t bring up things that have gone wrong in the past. What we have to take with us is the things that have gone well. We still think we have a big chance and that we are capable of winning every game.&quot; The alternative, after all, is barely worth thinking about. Mancini&apos;s team never recovered after taking one point from two games last season. To miss out again would represent one of the bigger disappointments of the Abu Dhabi United Group era. Rightly or wrongly, it would also mean their manager being subjected to the kind of scrutiny that has rarely come his way since arriving in Manchester. Mancini&apos;s record in this competition \u2013 never getting any further than the quarter-finals with Internazionale \u2013 is already fairly undistinguished for a man of his ambitions, not to mention those of his employers. If there is reason for encouragement, it is that Ajax have had a slow start to the season themselves, unbeaten in the Eredivisie but losing a 3-1 lead against Heracles Almelo at the weekend to make it five draws among their first nine games. Frank de Boer&apos;s team are currently bottom of Group D, having lost against Dortmund and Madrid. &quot;If we want to stay in Europe after the winter break, whether in the Champions League or Europa League, we need a result,&quot; De Boer said. &quot;We believe in it. The Real match was a poor match for us, but in the Dortmund game we were unlucky. This game is different. They are a good team but we have a good team as well.&quot; Ajax will certainly be encouraged by the fact City have lost three of their last four away games in Europe. For their latest expedition Mancini has changed the usual preparations \u2013 flying early and training at the stadium rather than a practice session in Manchester and then arriving in the evening. A small tweak, perhaps, but one that recognises the need for change.", "sentences": ["&quot;Frustrating,&quot; was the word Roberto Mancini used from his seat in the bowels of the Amsterdam Arena."], "title": "Manchester City tweak pre-match routine as they prepare to tackle Ajax", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/23/manchester-city-ajax-champions-league", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Ajax", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-24T20:39:00Z", "article": " Preamble: Ajax have been champions of Europe four times. Which makes those three primary school-style stars on Manchester City&apos;s jersey seem a celebration of piffle. But this is not, of course, the Ajax of yore; rather, similar to Greek mythologists, we must distinguish between Ajax the Great and the current outfit, Ajax the Lesser. If my comprehensive knowledge of the classics (read: hasty consultation of a well-known web-based encyclopedia) is anything to go by, Ajax the Lesser had impressive potential, pulled off some marvelous feats but, ultimately, began to believe he was better than he really was and perished through his own hubris, drowning while attempting to walk on water. There could be a significant omen in there for this Ajax side ahead of tonight&apos;s encounter with the far better-resourced City. On the other hand, this opening could be complete waffle, in which case try the next paragraph instead.  Right then. Fail to win here and City are as good as out of the Champions League at the first stage, again. And serial European flop Roberto Mancini could be as good as out of a job. Win here and City will live on to be outplayed by Real and Dortmund again before being knocked out. No English team is going to win the Champions League this year, are they?  Teams: Ajax the Lesser: Vermeer; Van Rhijn, Aldenweireld, Moisander, Blind; Schone, Poulsen, Eriksen; Sana, De Jong, Twitter&apos;s Ryan BabelSubs: Cillessen, Enoh, Sulemani, Boerrigter, Veltman, Dijks, FischerCity: Hart; Richards, Kompany, Lescott, Clichy; Milner, Tour\u00e9, Barry, Nasri; Aguero, DzekoSubs: Pantilimon, Sinclair, Kolarov, Tevez, Nastasic, Balotlli, Evans Ref: S Moen (Norway)  Mancini explains his selections: &quot;We had a players who spent a lot of energy on Saturday because we played for 70 minutes with one player down so I need fresh players for tonight.&quot; He also explains that Pablo Zabaleta is not fit but should be OK for Saturday; and that he reckons his team could be particularly dangerous form set-pieces tonight.&quot;  7.37pm: &quot;As an Ajax fan, while I certainly agree that this is indeed Ajax the Lesser, I don&apos;t think Ajax thought it was better than it really was (although that is indeed a real Ajax quality),&quot; howls Simon Broekema, who has misunderstood my intricately-compiled analogy. &quot;Rather, the Bosman ruling made it extremely difficult for Ajax to hold on to the talented players they had either grown themselves or scouted successfully. May I remind you that if you could make any team now featuring former Ajax players, that team would feature players like Sneijder, Van der Vaart, Nigel de Jong, Huntelaar, Ibrahimovic and Suarez. In any case, the Lesser Ajax is now a team full of young puppies, and they are unfortunately going to get destroyed tonight.&quot; That last bit is what I was driving at: they may have bitten off more than they can chew with this Champions League campaign.  Aside: As yet another ad for the latest James Bond movie blazes across my screen, I would like to formally register my disdain for this sort of thing. This ubiquitous marketing campaign for the new film, all designed to convey the notion that this release is some kind of vital cultural event, has put me right off seeing it. As has the fact that the last, ooooh, at least five Bond movies have been increasingly atrocious. Casino Royale was a nadir. Pure dross. And a poker scene shoehorned in to chime with the times but which, alas, made no sense whatsoever.  7.43pm: Anyway, speaking of vital cultural events, we&apos;ve just had the Champions League theme. Always makes the hairs on the palms of my hands stand up.  1 min: City kick off, and within second hoof the ball long towards Dzeko. A sign of things to come? Ajax deal with it easily.  3 min: Ajax are endeavouring to play their usual brand of slick and expansive football but it&apos;s all a bit patchy so far, and City haven&apos;t shown much either. Indeed, they have had little of the ball. In other news, here&apos;s a statement from Rio and Anton Ferdinand about matters you may have heard of.  5 min: Ajax are looking the more coherent. A nice one-two twixt Babel and De Jong concludes with the latter curling a shot well over the bar from 20 yards.  7 min: Ajax give the ball away in midfield, granting City a chance to come forward for the first time in the game. Do they try to build a meaningful attack? No, Dzeko tries to smash the ball into the net from 35 yards. And fails miserably, his feeble effort trickling harmlessly wide. &quot;You are lucky, Paul: we have incessant ads for who will make the best president, senator, congressman, dog catcher, floor sweeper et al,&quot; groans Geoff Ashworth, who presumably lives in Gambia.  10 min: Lovely effort! Again City were guilty of being too meek as Ajax played their way skilfully through them. They worked it quickly to Schone at the edge of the City box and the Dane fed it back to Eriksen, who cracked a vicious volley inches wide from 20 yards. Hart wouldn&apos;t have got to that.  12 min: The Champions League is all about clashes between the planet&apos;s biggest stars. So I should tell you that the big Christian Poulsen-Gareth Barry duel has been pretty even so far.  14 min: City build a threatening more for the first time, with Aguero heavily involved. After his team zip the ball about with more speed and purpose than they had previously summoned, the Argentinian tried to skedaddle his way into the box ... and he would have gotten away with it too, if it not for some excellent meddling by Alderweireld at the edge of the box.  16 min: Here&apos;s a worry: Yaya Tour\u00e9 is down injured. The replay does not reveal anything particularly damaging in the challenge by Blind so Tour\u00e9 may be able to continue. &quot;When I hear the injured players left behind are mostly the new ones, am I the only City fan who feels relieved they&apos;re not there and Mancini&apos;s got less choice about sticking with what&apos;s worked in the past?&quot; barks Paul Ruffley. City sure done botched their summer recruitment.  18 min: This Ajax may be The Lesser compared to their Great forefathers, but they&apos;re currently a good deal better than City, for whom, at least, Tour\u00e9 has just returned to the pitch after getting his ankle strapped.  20 min: As Ajax continue to circulate the ball nicely around a desperately passive City side, Gary Neville is asked by fellow Sky commentator about his memories of playing against Ryan Babel. &quot;I remember that whenever the ball came to his feet he seemed to be having an argument with it.&quot; Gary Neville, a prince among pundits!  21 min: Eriksen, playing as a false nine, is becoming ever more influential and executing some delicious moves. He just intigated another flowing Ajax attack before arriving at the end of it to flummox Barry before firing just wide from 20 yards.  GOAL! Ajax 0-1 City (Nasri 22&apos;) City score with a splendid counter-attack, their first of the game! Richards began it with an excellent pass to Milner, who slid it wide to Nasri, who, having charged in unmarked from the left, struck it first time past the keeper and into the corner of the goal form 17 yards. A classic sucker punch.  24 min: The match has quickly reverted to its pre-City goal pattern, with Ajax dominating play but showing little hint of a cutting edge. &quot; Come on Paul, I&apos;m no Alan Partridge-level Bond devotee but, surely, Casino Royale -with a proper, gritty actor at its heart - was better than prety much all Brosnan Bonds!&quot; fumes Ryan Dunne. No! There was something about Brosnan that made it clear he knew how preposterous the Bond wheeze was. Not nearly as much as the brilliant Roger Moore, who always looked like he was trying to suppress a laugh and never looked like he could really beat anyone up, let alone a villain hellbent on global destruction. Daniel Craig seems to take it too seriously.  26 min: Ajax look quite ragged at the back when City do go at them. A routine move down the right suddenly results in Richards cantering into the box with a free shot on goal. He blems it hard but straight the keeper, who bats it away.  29 min: Nasri over-hits an intended pass to Aguero. If he&apos;d got it right, the striker would have been in for number two.  32 min: De Jong sweeps a fine cross-field ball to Van Rhijn, who has got in down the right behind Clichy. But then he loses the head and sends a curler over the bar when a pass to a well-placed team-mate would have been a wiser option. &quot;Kolarov must wonder what he has to do to get a start over Clichy (who has been poor so far this season), especially after his masterful display against Sunderland,&quot; parps Daniel Field. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see him heading back to Italy soon.&quot; Who would match his wages?  35 min: City rumble forward again after absorbing lots of impotent Ajax possession. Milner finds Nasri in space on the left again but Van Rhijn gets across quickly to block the Frenchman&apos;s attempted cross-shot.  37 min: Ajax eschew an opportunity to send a cross into the box and instead take a short freekick from 30 yards. And then Schone dinks the ball straight into Hart&apos;s hands. Elsewhere in this group, Dortmund have just taken the lead against Madrid. Probably not what City want.  39 min: Schone has a whack from 25 yards. Into a canal it goes. Meanwhile, Ronaldo has just equalised for Madrid against Dortmund. &quot;The trouble with Bond movies is that they cannot make up their mind if they are serious films or not,&quot; sermonises Simon McMahon. &quot;Bond as depicted in the Fleming novels is a hard, unsympathetic character, whereas Bond on screen, and Daniel Craig in particular, is caught between portraying a serious role whilst having to put up with the inevitable one-liners and product placement. Connery remains the original and best, however.&quot;  43 min: Ajax continue to enjoy the majority of possession but have yet to look truly dangerous. &quot;Now, I&apos;ve not bothered sitting through a Bond film since the one with the evil media mogul on a ship, but I&apos;m pretty sure I would expect a poker scene in a film with Casino in the title,&quot; barfs Matt Dony. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it have been odder to not have any gambling in it?&quot; Yes, but the scene itself made no sense, as in the dynamics of the game were wrong.  GOAL! Ajax 1-1 City (De Jong 45&apos;) Did I say impotent Ajax attack? Not that time! Van Rhijn fired a cross to the edge of the area, where De Jong arrived at speed to batter a low shot into the net. Hart barely moved.  Half-time: Ajax did not look capable of cutting City for most of that half but the moral of their fine equaliser is that if you let a side play around you for long enough, they will eventually punish you. City need to be more assertive in the second half; but Manicni will probably continue to try absorbing Ajax&apos;s pressure and strike on the counter-attack. It may work. But being bolder is more likely to bring joy here, in my opinion.  Bond blather: &quot;What English footballer could play James Bond?&quot; wodners Justin Kavanagh. &quot;There aren&apos;t many suave enough: Bobby Moore in his pomp maybe? Steve Gerrard&apos;s too scouse. David Beckham is too Hollywood. Gary Neville might be wry enough, but that high-pitched orgasmic reaction to the Torres goal might turn off women fans of Bond. The villain of course would have to be a Johnnie Foreigner with schemes of world domination, maybe a Johan Cruyff, pontificating on the state of the global game from his Barcelona lair.&quot; Ray Wilkins or Micah Richards would get my vote.  Analysis: &quot;City brought this on themselves,&quot; blasts Michiel Jongsma. &quot;Leaving their left back position completely exposed and no urge trying to kill off the game after that first goal... I don&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing. Ajax have been fragile mentally all season, drawing five games from nine in the league, throwing away two goal leads and stuff. If City won&apos;t take all three points, they have only themselves to blame.&quot;  46 min: That&apos;s more like it from City! RIght from the resumption they tear forward, Nasri threading a pass through to Aguero. A fine tackle by Moisander thwarted his first shot and then the Argentinian clipped a cross into the centre but Ajax scrambled it away again.  48 min: Pleasingly, there is a higher pace to proceedings in this second half. Looks like Manci0ni has given his troops what for. Proper order. But will they sustain it? &quot;Danny Murphy would be a perfect Bond,&quot; trumpets Matt Dony. &quot;He would be sent by M (Karren Brady) to nullify the threat caused by Platini&apos;s evil schemes to wipe out the classic English footballing traditions of getting clubs into insanely deep debt and tackling like psychopaths. Along the way, Danielle Lloyd would try and catch his eye, then try to kill him, but one of Q&apos;s gadgets ( Joseph Barton) would see her off.&quot;  50 min: City enjoy their longest unbroken spell of possession of the match. It ends when Nasri swipes the ball down the left for Dzeko to chase; the Bosnia gets there and fires in a decent cross that Barry nods wide from eight yards.  51 min: Hats claims a corner with authority. Moments later City are down the other end threatening again, with even Tour\u00e9 getting involved around the opposing box, which he had singularly failed to do in the first half. City have certainly improved in this period.  53 min: Nasri escapes a booking despite a late tackle on Van Rhijn. So does Milner moments later (for a foul on Eriksen). In other news, my inbox is creaking under the volume of emails demanding that Scott Parker be hired to play Bond with immediate effect.  GOAL! Ajax 2-1 City (Moisander 56&apos;) This is shoddy from City! Concding the corner in the first place was slack but their attempt to defend it was worse, as no one was near Moisander as he rose near the front post and directed a powerful downward header into the net!  58 min: Milner attempts to recreate Tom Cleverley&apos;s cross for Javier Hernandez&apos;s second goal last night but Ajax defend it better than Braga did, as Van Rhijn heads behind for a corner. And that corner is then defended well too. City have got themelves into a right old pickle here. &quot;George Best could have played Bond,&quot; bugles Travis Dudfield. &quot;Sure, he was from Northern Ireland but who else had or has that kind of swagger?&quot; If we&apos;re broadening it out to include non-Englishmen (and why shouldn&apos;t we, given that Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan have played him), then my vote goes to Paolo Di Canio.  60 min: Dzeko penalised for leaping with the goalkeeper in a bid to connect with a loopy Nasri cross. Meanwhile, the Amsterdam Arena is rocking. &quot;If City fail to win this game (and thereby seriously endanger their chances of getting out of this group) because they, in stereotypical Italian fashion, lounged back on a designer divan on the edge of their own box after going 1-0 up with their first shot on target in the game, then Mancini&apos;s gonna seriously cop it,&quot; declares SB Tang, who&apos;s not wrong.  City substitution:  Looks like Mancini is going to switch to a back three: off comes Lescott, on comes Kolarov. Meanwhile, Tevez and Balotelli remains on the bench. Clichy is not looking best pleased about this defensive realignment and, it must be said, it hasn&apos;t worked very well previously this season.  65 min: That&apos;s a delicious cross from the left from Kolarov. Milner throws himself at it but can&apos;t keeper his header down. &quot;For an English James Bond, look no further than Teddy Sheringham,&quot; blurts Tobin Druce, who has a point.  67 min: Now Ajax are sitting back, allowing City the ball around mid-way ... until Richards gives it away to Babel, who hurtles forward. Kompany gets back to tidy things up.  GOAL! Ajax 3-1 City (Eriksen 68&apos;)  City are in serious trouble! Barry ceded possession deep inside City territory and Sana helped the ball on to Eriksen, who shot from 20 yards takes a treacherous deflection off Clichy and wrongfoots Hart.  70 min: The switch to three at the back has made a rabble of City, who nearly concede a fourth. Hart saves them, surging off his line to charge down a Sana shot after City were cut apart by a quick one-two. Moments later a long ball from the back flies over Ajax heads and into the path of Dzeko. It&apos;s Vermeer&apos;s turns to pull off a fine save.  City substitution: Tevez on, Barry off.  72 min: Suddenly this game is wackily open! Dzeko twists his way into the box at one hand, beats the keeper but finds himself at too acute an angle to score so manoeuvres himself to a more conducive position, enabling Vermeer to recover and make another crucial block. Then Ajax break down the other end and Babel&apos;s low shot from the left is held by Hart.  Ajax switch: Sana off, Enoh on. Ajax are trying to shore up this lead.  74 min: Kolarov bnooked for an immoral challenge on Schone.  76 min: Nasri takes the ball down with a beautiful touch inside the Ajaax box but then falls over under a challenge from Moisander. Nothing doing, says the ref. Meanwhile, Mancini appears to have rejigged his defence again as his team switch to a Hail Mary formation. Meanwhile, Simon McMahon is back with a suggestion for a Bond-sinspired post-match interview. &quot;If it stays like this I&apos;m hoping that Mancini&apos;s post match interview goes something like this: Mancini - &apos;Do you expect me to talk?&apos;. Interviewer - &apos;No, Mr Mancini, I expect you to cry.&apos;  78 min: Balotelli is now on the pitch, in place of Milner. &quot;Two things,&quot; booms HT. &quot;Surely Berba&apos;s your Bond? Also, a propos foreigners, a bit disappointed with SB Tang&apos;s tasteless Italian bashing, has he forgotten Napoli or Juve against Chelsea, to name recent examples?&quot; Why do you think SB Tang is a foreigner?  81 min: Freekick to City close to the corner flag on the right. Kolarov clatters it towards the near post. Vermeer punches it clear and Schone tonks it further away. It&apos;s not looking good for City.  83 min: City dink the ball around their own half for a while, looking vainly for options. None occur to them, so Nasri lofts it long into the box. Something nearly comes of it as Dzeko nods it down to Aguero, who tries to wriggle his way into a shooting position but is eventually crowded out.  85 min: Mancini&apos;s tinkering has left City light in midfield so the defenders are just hitting it long. Dzeko is is doing his best to turn punts into passes but it&apos;s not very productive so far.  86 min: Aguero wins the ball just outside the Ajax bonx and slams a shot just over. &quot;Man City - the George Lazenby of Group D?&quot; chuckles Simon McMahon, who&apos;s in a rich vein of form.  87 min: Dzeko meets Kolarvo&apos;s corner. Vermeer&apos;s saves Dzeko&apos;s header.  Ajax substitution: Boerrigter on, Schone off.  89 min: Dezko does well to take down another long ball, then feeds Tevez, who forces another corner. Ajax deal with it competently.  90 min: City have four minutes to save their Champions League campaign and redeem themselves.  90+1 min: Kolarov bangs a 25-yard freekick straight into the wall. &quot;Even Steve McClaren can conquer Dutch teams,&apos; tweets Will Unwin.  Full-time: The sky has fallen in on City. The most expensively-assembled team of all time are bottom of their Champions League group and tonight were punished for a passive, disjointed and at times feckless performance. They took the lead against the run of play and then seemed to the think they had already done enough. After conceding an equaliser on the stroke of half-time, they played the first 10 minutes of the second half with pace and purpose. And then relented again. And then conceded two sloppy goals. All in all, this was no why for a team with their resources to perform against valiant but eminently beatable opponents. City may need to win all three of their remaining games to save themselves: play like they have done in their first three (or at least two of their first three) and they probably won&apos;t win any.", "sentences": ["Meanwhile, the Amsterdam Arena is rocking."], "title": "Ajax v Manchester City - live!", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/24/champions-league-ajax-manchester-city", "tags": ["Champions League", "Ajax", "Manchester City", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-25T14:47:52Z", "article": "You could say Pentti Sammallahti was born for photography. His grandmother, Hildur Larsson, was an accomplished Swedish photographer for the Helsinki newspaper Kaiku in the 1900s. He grew up surrounded by her images. His father took him, aged nine, to the famous Family of Man group exhibition, curated by Edward Steichen, when it came to Helsinki in 1959. From that moment, the young Sammallahti knew what he wanted to do with his life. At 11, he made his first photographs \u2013 small contact prints of everyday life in Helsinki. In 1964, he joined the Helsinki Camera Club and blossomed. He had his first solo show in 1971, aged 20. The earliest photograph in Here, Far Away, a beautiful retrospective book of his work just published in Britain, dates from 1964, when he was 14. A man sleeps in a doorway, oblivious to the bird that pecks at the earth in the foreground. It is an almost austere image, formally accomplished and understated in its arrangement of vertical and horizontal lines: the doorframe, the wood panels, the bricked pavement. But there is an odd melancholic poetry too, not least in the two stark white lines someone has painted on the doorframe, one of which seems to rise, dreamlike, out of the sleeping man&apos;s outstretched palm. Above the bird, on the wall, someone has chalked a neat love heart with an arrow though it. Even at 14, Sammallahti&apos;s eye was drawn to the quiet illumination of everyday life. As he grew older, his vision deepened and widened, becoming both more poetic and more austere. The book is divided into nine chapters, each a record of Sammallahti&apos;s restless wanderings through Finland, Norway, Britain, eastern Europe, Africa, China and India. His first published portfolio, a limited edition of 200 signed silver gelatin prints in a box, featured images taken in the west of Ireland in 1978. It was dedicated to Paul Strand, but his photographs of rural Ireland, as well as those taken in Hungary and Romania, have more in common with Josef Koudelka&apos;s images of similar people and places. Sammallahti&apos;s gaze, though, is warmer, more intimate and, at times, more epic. A landscape in Erd\u0151b\u00e9nye, Hungary, taken in 1979, looks like a monochrome still from a beautiful film, or a landscape painting drained of colour. There is something both old-fashioned and timeless about it. A horse-drawn carriage transports two farmers and several stacks of hay. The wet road sweeps off into a misty backdrop, where two faraway steeples are divided by a telegraph pole rising out of tall grasses, silver-grey in the muted light. Sammallahti prints his own photographs, and the deep tones and textures are evidence of an equally deep patience and craftsmanship.     Houston, Texas, USA, 1998. Photograph: Pentti Sammallahti/Dewi Lewis Publishing    It was in the frozen expanses of Solovki on the White Sea in Russia that Sammallahti made some of his most extraordinary images. Here, the blankness of the landscape, shading into grey forests or skies, is an atmosphere in itself. Wolfish dogs and solitary birds feature in many of the images, survivors in a harsh, beautiful environment where everything \u2013 rivers, lakes, skies and bare trees \u2013 seems frozen into stillness. He also captures the changing of the seasons \u2013 snow giving way to mud, a different kind of grey making the landscape an entirely different world. For all that, Sammallahti&apos;s vision is also a lyrical one. He often captures humans and animals in worlds of their own, lost in reverie: dogs chase birds, birds cautiously approach humans or circle above them. Often, his camera captures a single figure in a dreamlike landscape: a man walking down a road in a silent, snow-covered world at dusk, his dog waiting, patient but alert, ahead of him. You can almost hear the crunch of snow underfoot. But what is most palpable is the silence of the surroundings. Looking at the photograph, you feel on the threshold of another, more mysterious world that is indeed here and far away. Now see this The Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto is most famous for the series Seascapes, for which he used a large format camera to take long exposures of the sea and sky in various locations around the globe.

Paisley&apos;s side won the trophy in 1976, then went on to dominate Europe for the best part of a decade. Benitez landed the thing with Valencia in 2004, then went to Anfield where his team regularly made their presence felt at the business end of the Champions League.  His young side being very much a work in progress, and inconsistent as hell to boot, Brendan Rodgers is unlikely to join the roll call of Uefa Cup winning bosses quite yet. Which is not to say he&apos;ll not be going for glory this season. Widely expected to name a team of 12-year-olds tonight, with the Merseyside derby looming at the weekend and qualification from Group A a big ask for his thin squad, he&apos;s only gone and done this: Jones, Wisdom, Johnson, Agger, Skrtel, Gerrard, Sahin, Shelvey, Assaidi, Downing, Suarez. Amsterdam or bust, then. Amsterdam or bust.  But even if Liverpool aren&apos;t quite there yet, this game might still offer some major pointers for the future of European football. Anzhi Makhachkala were purchased by $6.5bn oligarch Suleiman Kerimov in January 2011, and they&apos;re quickly making their mark. With Guus Hiddink at the helm, and having signed former Chelsea star Yuri Zhirkov, Christopher Samba from Blackburn Rovers, Lassana Diarra from Real Madrid and Samuel Eto&apos;o from Internazionale, they&apos;re already clear at the top of this year&apos;s nascent Russian league, and would rather like to become only the third Russian winners of this trophy, CSKA Moscow and Zenit St Petersburg having already done the business in 2005 and 2008. Their ambition, set against Liverpool&apos;s quiet rebirth, should make for a fascinating spectacle this evening. It is on!  Kick off: 8.05pm.  That unexpectedly strong Liverpool side again, because let&apos;s face it, I&apos;ve buried it in all that waffle: Jones, Wisdom, Skrtel, Agger, Johnson, Gerrard, Sahin, Shelvey, Downing, Suarez, Assaidi.Subs: Gulacsi, Henderson, Carragher, Allen, Suso, Sterling, Yesil.  Anzhi Makhachkala, who are giving me a Lady Marmalade earworm: Vladimir Gabulov, Agalarov, Samba, Joao Carlos, Zhirkov, Shatov, Georgi Gabulov, Boussoufa, Carcela-Gonzalez, Eto&apos;o, Smolov.Subs: Pomazan, Gadzhibekov, Lakhiyalov, Tagirbekov, Logashov, Mukhammad, Traore.  Referee: Bas Nijhuis (Holland)  History will teach us \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e. \u041d\u0435\u0442! \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e! And this is because Liverpool have never played Anzhi before. And Anzhi have never played an English team before. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b. The last time Liverpool faced Russian opposition, they beat CSKA Moscow 3-1 to make off with the 2005 Uefa Super Cup. Previous to that, they&apos;ve hosted Russian sides three times, spanking Spartak Moscow 5-0 in the Champions League in 2002, drawing 0-0 with Alania Vladikavkaz in the 1995 Uefa Cup to seal a 2-1 aggregate win, and being skelped 2-0 by the aforementioned Muscovites in the 1992 Cup Winners Cup, that defeat coming off the back of a 4-2 humiliation at Spartak&apos;s place. Oh Graeme! How could you!  Recent form&apos;s probably a better guide, isn&apos;t it? \u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0430. Anzhi are on a four-game winning run; they&apos;ve only lost once this season domestically, and are unbeaten on their continental manoeuvres. Liverpool meanwhile have are on a winning run of their own, one in a row, having edged past Reading at the weekend. Still, early days for Brendan, and all. Early days.  Rodgers, Rodgers and Hammerstein: After a blast of that showtune, the players and managers take to the pitch. Liverpool in their famous red, Anzhi in neon yellow. Gerry Marsden&apos;s in the crowd, by the way, pop kids. Can Liverpool do it for the man who&apos;s serenaded them onto the field of play for the last 50 years?  And we&apos;re off! A fair old atmosphere as Liverpool set the ball rolling. It&apos;s not quite St Etienne &apos;77 or Chelsea &apos;05, but it&apos;s a European night at Anfield, so. Anzhi will be kicking towards the Kop in this half, which means Liverpool will be doing it in the second period, just as they like it. Suarez attempts to diddle into the area down the inside left, but gets nowhere.  2 min: It&apos;s been all Liverpool so far, in terms of possession at least. They&apos;ve done nothing with it as of yet, but they&apos;ll be pleased enough with the opening 120 seconds. &quot;Well, after my expert jinxing of Sebastian Coates in the last home Europa tie I&apos;ll be keeping my optimism firmly under lock and key this time around,&quot; promises Phil Sawyer. &quot;To be honest, it doesn&apos;t need much damping down. The last time I felt less optimistic about getting a result was when [fellow regular MBM crackpot] Mac Millings set me up with a blind date. I expect lots of dinky passing it around before the new Russian All-Stars exploit our shaky defence to grab a 2-1 victory. And Suarez to pick up an injury. And then we&apos;ll lose the derby at the weekend. And then my toffee-nosed mum will be on the phone Sunday night, gloating to the heavens. To be honest, she might be on the phone at 10pm tonight gloating to the heavens. She&apos;s never really forgiven me for supporting the Reds.&quot; And there you have it, a nervous breakdown in 136 words. Is Millings reading this, I wonder? If you are, do you fancy popping round to check on him? Confiscate all sharp objects, shoelaces, gin, etc. And perhaps fiddle around with his browser settings to block this website.  4 min: &quot;Is it true that Downing is at or near the top of the Europa League assists list so far in this campaign?&quot; asks Peter Oh, and let&apos;s hope he expects me to ignore rather than answer that question. &quot;I can&apos;t decide if that says more about Stewart&apos;s improving form, or the abject lack of quality in EL opposition. In any case, wasn&apos;t he demoted to left back, fourth choice goalkeeper, or water carrier? He&apos;s in the starting XI and it has four recognized defenders already, so he must be out of the doghouse and back on frenetic, aimless winger duty?&quot; I can indeed report that he&apos;s patrolling the right wing at the moment, and he has in fact managed a pass. But it was Wisdom who had to take the initiative and attempt to fire a cross into the area. Still, plenty of time for him to get his act together and utilise some of that talent. He&apos;s only 27.  5 min: My mistake, he&apos;s 28.  6 min: A decent run by the ever-lively Suarez down the right. He twists and turns Samba as he reaches the area, but attempts one dropped shoulder too many - a third, naturally - and the ball&apos;s bundled away.  7 min: Assaidi wins a corner down the left, off Samba as the big man comes across to cover. Assaidi takes it himself, hits it too long, then Gerrard fires the ball out of play on the right.  9 min: Skrtel has just booted Smolov up the arse. It&apos;s a proper comic-book punt, a clumsy load of nonsense. The Anzhi man&apos;s down injured, and no wonder, he&apos;s just had a load of studs pressed into his left buttock. He gets up, and he&apos;s got a face on, as the ref&apos;s done nothing. Expect more developments.  11 min: Plenty of space for Suarez down the left, but he overcooks the cross. No matter, the box was hardly loaded with red shirts anyway. The camera pans to the crowd, where $6.5bn oligarch Suleiman Kerimov is watching his team. He&apos;s dressed in a trucker&apos;s cap and checked shirt. He&apos;s dressed like the lead singer in Lambchop, or perhaps someone signed to Sub Pop in 1989. $6.5bn!  12 min: Suarez is looking lively, almost as though he&apos;s been told to go hell for leather for 45-60 minutes before being wrapped in cotton wool for the Everton game on Sunday. He dances along the edge of the Anzhi area, and upon reaching the left-hand edge of the D, hits a weak shot straight at Vladimir Gabulov, who gobbles up the ball.  15 min: Eto&apos;o shows for the first time. He offers it to Agger down the inside right, lets the defender slide in to commit himself, then nudges it right to Smolov. Eto&apos;o continues his run into the box, but the return pass is overcooked and useless. Eto&apos;o looks extremely displeased with this turn of events, and looks at his team-mate like that.  18 min: Liverpool aren&apos;t quite clicking yet, but both Suarez and Assaidi are jigging around at high pace down either flank. A sense one of them might showcase a routine just so, and create themselves a chance. But nothing more than a sense as of yet.  21 min: Well, here&apos;s Assaidi dancing clear down the left, reaching the byline and pulling one back for Johnson, whose attempt is blasted straight at the keeper. Liverpool are slowly turning up some heat. &quot;If ever there was a Lambchop song that typified Liverpool last season, it&apos;s Life&apos;s Little Tragedy,&quot; croons Graeme Neill, quietly, with jazzy guitar flitting in and out, unobtrusively. &quot;Slightly more optimistic about this season, thanks to the excitability of Virility&apos;s Raheem Sterling and the rampaging yellow card machine that is Jonjo Shelvey.&quot;  22 min: Samba is booked for coming straight through the back of Suarez. The Anfield faithful cheer in the ironic fashion. Gerrard takes the free kick, 35 yards out, and blasts it witlessly at the wall. The Anfield faithful moan, but this noise is telling it straight, no need for analysis of subtext.  24 min: This should have been the opening goal. A long ball down the inside right is misjudged awfully by Joao Carlos. Suarez tears clear, and is within his right to shoot once he reaches the area, but instead unselfishly slides a pass inside for Shelvey, who leans back and blooters an awful effort miles over the bar. Shelvey&apos;s the joint leading scorer in this competition - or at least he was before the start of play today - and therefore the crowd were expecting better.  27 min: Smolov and Skrtel come together in the Liverpool area down the left, the former running and then falling over the latter, who is sliding across the turf. Smolov was never really in control of the ball, but then neither was Skrtel of himself. The referee doesn&apos;t care, and neither do Anzhi really, though they make half-arsed claims for a penalty. &quot;I&apos;m now an MBM crackpot?&quot; cries Phil Sawyer (2min). &quot;Does one have to obtain a certain number of MBM mentions to attain this status or is it down to the tenure of the comments? If the former, how many more is it to the next level? And what is the next level? MBM loser? MBM basket case? MBM exile?&quot; The next level of social ineptitude? MBM writer, probably.  28 min: Johnson riffs down the left, and is stopped in the area by a little tug from Agalarov. Johnson elects the non-cynical approach, staying up and pulling the ball back for the impressive Assaidi, who nudges the ball forwards then pelts a low shot towards the bottom left. It&apos;s not hit with much venom, although keeper Gabulov makes a meal of dealing with it.  32 min: The impressive Assaidi. That&apos;s what I just said. So here he is, overhitting a hilariously inept free kick straight down the keeper&apos;s throat from the right touchline, with the box loaded with team-mates. Thank you, my Guardian Sport!  34 min: Agalarov makes a dangerous run into space down the right. Boussoufa hits the worst pass in the history of All Football, about 20 yards behind his overlapping team-mate and out of play. Liverpool off the hook. That passage of play came after an Anzhi free kick deep in Liverpool territory down the right, which was so bad it defies description. So I&apos;ll not try.  35 min: Chasing after a clever Suarez pass, Johnson finds himself in space down the inside-left channel, closing in on goal. He makes it to the six-yard box, then takes a fresh-air swipe with his right peg. Oh dear. He claims a penalty, with Agalarov behind him, but it&apos;s out of embarrassment more than anything else.  36 min: Corner to Liverpool down the right. Gerrard takes. Sahin, on the penalty spot, gets his eyebrows to the ball, but can&apos;t keep it down and on target. &quot;I guess Stewart Downing will be dressing up as a footballer for Halloween,&quot; writes Ciaran McGowan. Does he not scare you enough already? &quot;Surely it is time he came out and confessed that it was an April Fool Joke that got out of hand and that he is really a librarian by trade.&quot;  39 min: Anzhi have been very quiet. Eto&apos;o feeds Carcela-Gonzalez down the right, but the Moroccan falls onto his face. &quot;Samuel Eto&apos;o is not getting much service but he&apos;s acting like it should be delivered on silver platter,&quot; opines Gene Salorio. &quot;Highest paid player in the world looks like he&apos;s somewhere in Europe on an austerity budget because he&apos;s being very economical with his efforts.&quot;  41 min: Agger has had enough of this nonsense, and decides to go on the rampage down the inside-left channel. He hits a shot of extreme violence towards the top-left corner. The ball rises too quickly, but that wasn&apos;t a bad effort at all, and had Gabulov scrambling across with furrowed brow.  42 min: Agalarov is booked for tugging Assaidi&apos;s arm in a very cynical fashion as the winger looks to slalom down the left. He looks decent enough, does Assaidi, direct, purposeful and skilful, the Bizarro Downing. &quot;Great effort by Agger,&quot; writes Matt Dony. &quot;Shame the camera missed him giving Roberto Carlos on the Anzhi bench a quick wink just before he hit it.&quot;  45 min: Anzhi put a lovely smooth passing move together down the left, Shatov spreading it wide, Zhirkov the pivot, then Smolov cutting in to fire a fizzer across Jones and out of play on the right.  HALF TIME: Liverpool 0-0 Anzhi Makhachkala. And that&apos;s that for the half. Hmm. Not a whole lot to say about that, really. And there&apos;s no point me droning on.  HALF-TIME ENTERTAINMENT: Liverpool haven&apos;t served up much of it so far, so here&apos;s some alternative scouse-based amusements to while away the time.              Run it up your mast nine times, it&apos;ll get you through this second half.  Here comes entertainment! The second half&apos;s starting, and Raheem Sterling has come on for Glen Johnson. That means the woeful Stewart Downing has been pushed back to left-back - and while we&apos;re hearing Johnson has a minor knock, there&apos;s also a suggestion Downing&apos;s just had the gauntlet thrown down at his feet by Brendan Rodgers. Has he entered the last-chance saloon?  47 min: A quick bellow from the crowd as Anzhi get the second half underway, and then we quickly fall into relative silence. An appropriate time for this email, then, and Ciaran McGowan&apos;s comment on 36 mins has reminded one of our readers of their favourite librarian joke. &quot;It doesn&apos;t really work on the page, but here goes. Man walks into a library, goes up to the counter and says &apos;Can I have a pint of lager and a packet of crisps please?&apos; Librarian replies, &apos;I&apos;m sorry but this is a library.&apos; Man says again (this time in a whisper) &apos;Can I have a pint of lager and a packet of crisps please?&apos;&quot; Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for Simon McMahon. He&apos;s here all week, try the lamb and vegetable stew.  49 min: This came from nothing. Eto&apos;o fannies around in the middle of his own half as he receives a pass. Skrtel comes bombing in, races off with the ball, and blasts a shot at goal. A really decent effort, but the keeper&apos;s behind it. &quot;Stewart Downing is surely nothing as exciting as a librarian,&quot; insists J Willoug. &quot;A chartered accountant, perhaps? Or a real estate salesman? Apologies to those chartered accountants and real estate salespersons out there who enjoy their jobs - I know a librarian who enjoys her job, but none from your professions.&quot;  50 min: How about this for an aerial match-up: Sterling v Samba? Sure enough, having introduced the concept, it&apos;s the tiny Sterling who wins it, flicking the ball on for Shelvey down the inside left. Shelvey reaches the area and lifts the ball into the centre for Gerrard, who running into the box at pace guides his header well wide left of goal. If that had been on target, the keeper, rooted, wasn&apos;t getting there.  53 min: YOU KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN... Liverpool 1-0 Anzhi Makhachkala. Stewart Downing has just scored a magnificent goal. He cuts inside from the left, looks lost for a couple of seconds, then decides TO HELL WITH IT, and hammers a gorgeous screamer into the top right corner. He races off with a huge smile of relief, more than anything, playing across his face. On the touchline, Brendan Rodgers points at him, smiling broadly too. If he has had a kick up the shorts, it&apos;s really worked. And look what happens, Stewart, when you take a chance.  55 min: Suarez welts a vicious drive towards the top left corner from 30 yards. Half the ground think it&apos;s gone in, and scream accordingly, but it&apos;s just wide left. Liverpool have woken up alright, and credit where it&apos;s due, it&apos;s all down to Downing. &quot;Stewart Downing scored?&quot; asks Hubert O&apos;Hearn. &quot;That explains it. My dog has started woofing in perfect iambic pentameter.&quot;  57 min: Assaidi scampers down the left and slides the ball inside to Suarez. The pass doesn&apos;t come off, but the ball falls to Shelvey, who bumbles through a challenge down the inside left and attempts a shot from a tight angle. It&apos;s deflected and blocked, and easily picked off by keeper Gabulov. &quot;Can a chartered accountant do THAT?&quot; asks Matt Dony, not unreasonably. &quot;Always liked the boy.&quot;  60 min: Liverpool look a totally different team in this second half. A hearty chant of &quot;There&apos;s only one Brendan Rodgers&quot; from the Kop. They&apos;re still furiously scribbling down a Downing chant on the back of an envelope, presumably.  62 min: Logashov replaces Agalarov.  63 min: Suarez slides Shelvey clear down the middle. A heavy touch allows Shatov to cut across the midfielder as he shapes to shoot from the edge of the area, whip the ball from his toe, and hack clear for a corner. The set piece is a waste of time and energy.  64 min: Smolov is replaced by the 6ft 8in figure of Lacina Traore. Beating Samba in the air&apos;s all good and well, but let&apos;s see Sterling go up against him.  67 min: A slight lull in proceedings at the moment, allowing the stadium to stand in memory of the 96 who died at Hillsborough.  70 min: &quot;To be fair,&quot; begins Jon Rushton, &quot;there&apos;s still plenty of time for Liverpool to create four or five more gilt edged chances, and then concede in the 90th minute. Downing own goal?&quot; Almost perfect timing there, Jon, as Downing, near his own corner flag, plays a pointless square pass through the Liverpool area. That&apos;s beyond foolish. Luckily he&apos;s still in credit tonight, as Liverpool swarm around Eto&apos;o, who&apos;s picked up the loose ball. And though the striker gets a shot away on the turn, looking for the top right corner from the penalty spot, Jones is able to claim without fuss. Downing has the good grace to look sheepish.  73 min: Anzhi are beginning to make Liverpool anxious. A long ball down the inside right channel. Traore, on the edge of the area, is this close to taking the ball down and shooting from the edge of the box, but can&apos;t control. There is an obvious joke to be made here about erstwhile Liverpool left back Djimi, but let&apos;s show a little respect to a guy who, in fairness, has cleared a ball off a line in a European Cup final.  75 min: Assaidi is sent scampering towards the area down the left, released by a lovely diagonal spray from Gerrard. He enters the area and is nudged to his knees from behind by Logashov, but there&apos;s no penalty. You&apos;ll have seen them given. Suarez, the heat descending, is booked for attempting to engage the referee in a Hegelian dialectic.  77 min: Zhirkov aims for the bottom-left corner from the edge of the area. His shot is deflected off Wisdom, and parried round the post by Jones. Before the corner, Lahiyalov replaces Boussoufa. Then Shatov takes the corner, and it&apos;s plucked from the air by Jones, who has looked as solid as Pepe Reina, which admittedly isn&apos;t saying much these days.  79 min: Allen replaces Shelvey.  80 min: Anyone remember Gary Crosby and Andy Dibble? From a Liverpool corner, Agger heads towards the top left. Gabulov claims. The players stream upfield. Gabulov balances the ball on the platform of his right hand. Agger comes up from behind, heads it off the keeper&apos;s palm, and hoicks the ball into the empty net. The goal, miserably, is disallowed and Agger is booked.             Football is supposed to be fun, remember.  83 min: A couple of close shaves for Liverpool, who may yet regret not getting a second goal. First Carcela-Gonzalez cuts inside from the right and sends a low, dangerous fizzer goalwards. Jones and Skrtel combine to clear. Then Traore nips in at the left-hand post, poking just wide. Anfield is tense. But with Young Boys winning 3-1 in the other game, as things stand, Liverpool will be leading the group tonight.  86 min: Assaidi romps down the left, checks, and rolls the ball inside to Gerrard, who lumps over from 25 yards. &quot;I&apos;m a (qualified) librarian and I enjoy it a lot more than I&apos;ve enjoyed being a Liverpool supporter in recent times,&quot; notes Ned Potter.  88 min: Downing has certainly been trying his hardest to undo all his good work. Twice in the last couple of minutes, he&apos;s played needlessly jazzy passes near his corner flag, inviting pressure on his defence. This time, something nearly comes of it, Carcela-Gonzalez looking for the bottom-right corner from the edge of the box, Jones behind it all the way.  90 min: This is better from Downing. Carcela-Gonzalez, who is ending this game strongly, gets the makeshift fullback one on one, racing towards the area down the right. Downing clatters him to the ground like Mark Dennis, then wanders off with the ball, wearing a look of beatific innocence. The referee waves play on. Stewart Downing: hard man.  90 min +1: This is the first of three added minutes, and there&apos;s nearly been a goal at each end. First Sterling goes on a freestyle run through the Anzhi area from right to left - imagine the shape of a treble clef. He eventually falls to earth with a big bass thud. No penalty. Anzhi fly upfield, Carcela-Gonzalez wheeching a low shot across the face of goal and inches wide of the left-hand post.  90 min +2: A lot of misplaced Liverpool passes, but Anzhi aren&apos;t taking advantage.  FULL TIME: Stewart Downing 1-0 Anzhi Makhachkala. A free kick for Anzhi down the right. They load the box - then fail to hoof the ball into it. Dear me. And that&apos;s it! Liverpool win a tight match, deservedly so mind you, and top their group. Downing is ushered towards the Kop by his manager, where he&apos;s greeted by a warm round of applause. There&apos;s nice! Remember how it feels, Stew.

However galling the vast majority of Manchester City fans find it, whatever it says about the impatience of the modern game, this is a tough business and the Italian cannot automatically be guaranteed a fifth season should his team miss out on &quot;the miracle&quot; he talked about before leaving Amsterdam and the scene of one of his lowest moments as manager. Not quite the lowest but, equally, not far off. Carlos Tevez&apos;s mutiny on the touchline at Bayern Munich still has to be the nadir. There was the 0-0 draw at home to Birmingham City in his first season when an unpopular substitution prompted fans to turn on him, and the turbulent defeat at Arsenal in April that left them eight points behind Manchester United, seemingly out of the title race and with an open acceptance at the club that he might pay with his job. Yet what happened against Ajax on Wednesday certainly makes the top five. With one point from three games, it will not even be straightforward for City to qualify for the Europa League now, never mind the knockout stages of the Champions League, the competition the Abu Dhabi United Group craves the most. Mancini&apos;s position in May then becomes a legitimate talking point. He would have to retain the title if his job prospects were not to recede dramatically. The mere suggestion will be unpopular, but this is the pressure under which a manager exists at this level. Everything we have come to know about the club&apos;s owner, Sheikh Mansour, and the more hands-on chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, indicates they are not trigger-happy, but men of this wealth are not renowned for their tolerance when key employees fail to deliver what is expected of them. Mancini has not only presided over an unsatisfactory run of results in Europe, but his judgment has also come into question with an unusual frequency. He is yet to settle on his best formation this season, or offer a reasonable explanation about why he is making so many experimental changes. Against Ajax, he tried out three different systems. James Milner played central midfield, right wing and wing-back. Sergio Ag\u00fcero, one of the best strikers in the business, started on the left and then moved into the centre. Micah Richards and Ga\u00ebl Clichy played as full-backs then centre-halves. Samir Nasri began on the right wing and finished on the left. Yaya Tour\u00e9 was first an advanced midfielder, then a holding one. An argument can be made that players should not be restricted to one role, but wholesale changes will always disturb a team&apos;s rhythm. In total, there were only two outfield players \u2013 Vincent Kompany and Edin Dzeko \u2013 who played the entire match in the same position. It was as tactically naive as City have looked in the Mancini era and, behind the scenes, Richards is not the only player to have reservations about the need for change, particularly when it comes to experimenting with a three-man defence. The deterioration in the team&apos;s defending is certainly not what Mancini must have envisaged after employing a new coach, Angelo Gregucci, in the summer to work specifically on this part of the team. Gregucci was Mancini&apos;s assistant at Fiorentina in 2001. Since then, the 48-year-old has managed eight different Italian teams but had only one spell in Serie A, where he lasted barely five weeks at Lecce. He was sacked by Reggina in April, only three months after taking the job, and does not speak English, meaning Mancini quite often has had to translate for him on the training ground. City&apos;s three fixtures in the Champions League so far have seen the opposition accumulate a total of 72 shots which contrasts with 85 in their eight Premier League games. &quot;Last season we were so good, not conceding many goals,&quot; Joleon Lescott said. &quot;We got a lot of plaudits so it&apos;s only fair that we get criticism now because we are conceding more goals.&quot; The defender himself had a particularly difficult time against Ajax, badly caught out when Niklas Moisander headed the second goal for the Dutch champions. &quot;As a team,&quot; Lescott added, &quot;we are not overly enthusiastic about the way things are going.&quot; He did not elaborate whether he meant results or tactics, but quite possibly both. The problem for Mancini is that he has never taken a team past the quarter-finals of the Champions League and already has lost one job because of it. Then, like now, he had financial backing in the shape of Massimo Moratti&apos;s \u00a4600m outlay at Internazionale. Mancini&apos;s final season at San Siro saw them lose to Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions League and the Italian newspapers questioned whether he would ever be successful in Europe. &quot;One evening manages to cancel out the excitement from two years of victories,&quot; one wrote. &quot;And Inter discover themselves to be quite provincial \u2013 that is, capable only of winning in their back yard.&quot; Right now, the same applies to City. Mancini has demonstrated he is a manager of class and achievement but that is in Serie A and the Premier League when it is the Champions League that matters the most to the men in power in Abu Dhabi.", "sentences": ["However galling the vast majority of Manchester City fans find it, whatever it says about the impatience of the modern game, this is a tough business and the Italian cannot automatically be guaranteed a fifth season should his team miss out on &quot;the miracle&quot; he talked about before leaving Amsterdam and the scene of one of his lowest moments as manager."], "title": "Robert Mancini's tinkerman touch is not helping City's Euro ambitions", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/25/roberto-mancini-manchester-city-euro", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Champions League", "European club football", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-26T16:21:01Z", "article": "Derry&apos;s city of culture team have a magnificent view of the river Foyle&apos;s west bank and the historic walled city as well as what could be a grand and popular public square \u2013 but one that most residents have despised with passion for decades. The enormous square was a British army parade ground. If you lived locally and did see the inside of Ebrington barracks, which were shielded by ugly corrugated iron and barbed wire, then it was probably for the wrong reasons. The base, used as the army&apos;s main barracks during 30 years of the Troubles, closed in 2004. This week there was more of a party feel in the square, the venue for the launch of the \u00a316m programme of events that will make up Derry&apos;s year as the first UK city of culture \u2013 a dizzying list that will include performances by the Royal Ballet, the London Symphony Orchestra and the first staging of the Turner prize outside England. There will also be lots of community arts events. &quot;We want to take culture out on to the streets, to make it accessible to as many people as possible,&quot; said the executive programmer Graeme Farrow. &quot;People will have moments that they will never, ever forget.&quot; The area is already reaping benefits, although people in the city are taking one bit of news with a large pinch of salt. Lonely Planet this week named Derry as the fourth best city to visit next year after San Francisco, Amsterdam and Hyderabad. &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;re more interesting than Beijing [fifth], to be fair,&quot; said Michael Bradley, who was \u2013 and still is \u2013 bass player with the city&apos;s best-known musical sons, the Undertones. There must be something about Derry though. When the Undertones started achieving success in the late 1970s there was no question of moving. &quot;It was always important to us to base ourselves in Derry. It was homesickness and the punk ethic as well. Our manager always used to say: &apos;You can&apos;t go home again,&apos; but I don&apos;t think we were ever away from Derry for more than four weeks.&quot; There was every reason not to go back. &quot;Anyone who knows about Northern Ireland will say that the 70s were bleak,&quot; said Bradley. &quot;And they kind of were.&quot; Apart from a very big pub quiz scene, &quot;entertainment had kind of dried up in Derry&quot;. The twice-Turner-prize-nominated artist Willie Doherty is part of the same generation as Bradley and he remembers Derry being a modern art desert until the Orchard Gallery came along in the early 80s. Things have moved on a long way since then and the company behind the city of culture year expect it to be transformative for what is a small and young city \u2013 around 108,000 people, nearly half under the age of 25. Doherty agrees: &quot;It has the potential to be hugely significant for Derry, if it can be successful in delivering some kind of legacy. There&apos;s always the kind of fear with things like this that it brings a lot of excitement and a lot of energy for a year and then it kind of stops \u2013 it&apos;s like turning the tap on and quickly turning it off. Hopefully that won&apos;t be the case.&quot; The city has many issues to contend with, not least its violent past. But locals like to assure visitors that the violence is in the past. American tourists wander happily in search of their &quot;roots&quot;; the man at the Bloody Sunday museum cheerfully tells a Norwegian tourist that &quot;Derry is now one of the safest cities in Europe&quot; over the disturbing soundtrack of the events in 1972 played on a loop. According to Bradley, Derry now has the same problems as any other city \u2013 lack of money, job insecurity and so on. &quot;It does not have its unique problems.&quot; The city of culture&apos;s former offices have twice been targeted by dissident republicans, first with a pipe bomb in January 2011 and last October with a bomb left outside late at night. No one was injured and 250 people were moved to protest against the attacks. One of the most positive events has been the opening last year of the 312-metre-long pedestrian bridge over the Foyle, the &quot;Peace Bridge&quot; between the mainly Catholic cityside and the waterside where most Protestants live. &quot;I still get excited going across it,&quot; said Bradley. &quot;There&apos;s a really beautiful park over there and people this side said they hadn&apos;t been over in 30 years.&quot; Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the city of culture company, can easily see the bridge from her office in Building 71 of what was Ebrington barracks. She said it had been &quot;transformative&quot; and it is part of her job to take things even further. &quot;We are all a bit tired of the one-dimensional story. Even at this advanced stage of the peace process journalists still descend on this city if there&apos;s a dissident pipe bomb somewhere. There could be five shootings in Dublin in a night and Derry will still get more coverage. We are keen to take this moment over the next year to make a different statement about this place.&quot; The UK city of culture initiative was born out of the huge success of Liverpool as European city of culture in 2008. It was the embers of the Labour government and the then culture secretary Andy Burnham thought: &quot;Why not do it ourselves?&quot; He opened an application process for a UK city of culture which ended with a shortlist of Derry, Birmingham, Norwich and Sheffield. By the time Derry was announced as winner in 2010 the government had changed, but given that there was no money on offer from Westminster \u2013 it&apos;s all about leverage \u2013 there was no reason to put a brake on things. The overall cost is in the region of \u00a325m, with \u00a316m for programming. The lion&apos;s share, \u00a312.6m, is from the Northern Ireland Executive. &quot;It is the biggest single investment on this island ever made for cultural programming,&quot; said McCarthy. &quot;A total vote of confidence.&quot; The programme of events next year came out on Thursday. They include a new Sam Shepard play from Field Day, the theatre company set up in Derry 30 years ago by Brian Friel and Stephen Rea; a three-day participatory spectacle devised by Frank Cottrell Boyce called The Return of Colmcille; a &quot;punk musical&quot; called Teenage Kicks; and a concert by another Derry boy, the songwriter and performer Phil Coulter. The Turner prize will take place in a smart redbrick barracks building that used to house soldiers. Farrow said it was a huge deal. &quot;When you are talking about a city of 115,000 people I don&apos;t think you can overestimate the effect it will have. One of our aims is to get every schoolchild studying art in Northern Ireland to the Turner prize, getting them there for free and in for free.&quot; Inspiring a new generation and involving communities is a big part of the year. There is a &quot;music promise&quot; to involve more than 7,000 schoolchildren in events with thousands of free tickets. &quot;This is not the culture company&apos;s programme. It&apos;s not the city council&apos;s programme,&quot; said McCarthy. &quot;It is the programme of the neighbourhoods, the community, the education sector and cultural practitioners of this city. &quot;We&apos;ve accumulated and curated a programme that creates a balance between genuine authentic cultural representation of this city and major national and international collaborations that lift us out of ourselves.&quot; What Derry wants to happen is what happened in Liverpool. Some of the rigorously compiled statistics are striking: 66% of residents took part in at least one city of culture event, visitor figures to Merseyside&apos;s biggest attractions rose 50%, and tourists flocked in their millions, having an economic impact of \u00a3754m. All the evidence shows that the &quot;city of culture&quot; idea works, but only if it is done properly \u2013 something McCarthy is well aware of. She thinks only Glasgow and Liverpool have made &quot;a radical strategic difference&quot;. She added: &quot;Some have used it as a moment for absolutely exclusive high-end art.&quot; Derry is resolutely following the Glasgow and Liverpool model with its ambitions set just as high. Things so far have not been all plain sailing. Earlier this month the project hit the local headlines when the city council took control of the marketing department. McCarthy dismissed it as a &quot;non-story \u2026 it was just nonsense, just operational stuff, all of us were agreed it was about combining resources and efforts.&quot; Certainly it does not seem to have dimmed the frantic enthusiasm of the people involved in the company, most of whom are from Derry. There does appear to be a genuine sense of optimism in Derry. Bradley said most people had a wait-and-see mentality. &quot;I think we&apos;ll look back on it as a success,&quot; he said. &quot;My theory is that all you have to do is maybe go to three events and you&apos;ll think: &apos;Yes, that was good, I really enjoyed that.&apos;&quot;", "sentences": ["Lonely Planet this week named Derry as the fourth best city to visit next year after San Francisco, Amsterdam and Hyderabad."], "title": "Derry hopes for transformative year as first UK city of culture", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/26/derry-uk-city-of-culture", "tags": ["Derry", "UK city of culture", "Festivals", "Culture", "Northern Ireland", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-26T18:58:48Z", "article": "I&apos;ve just tried a Hornit, the loudest bicycle horn on the market, at 140 decibels. A louder one \u2013 the Hornster, 178 decibels \u2013 does exist, but is too cumbersome for mass production, comprising three giant horns and a scuba diving air cylinder. Mine is the size of a front light, and makes the noise of a rape alarm, or 10 tumble dryers all finishing at once. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s a traffic fallacy, and I&apos;m letting my doomish picture of the world spill on to its major throughways, but it&apos;s all gone a bit Grand Theft Auto on the roads lately. Cabbies are fighting other cabbies; cyclists are yelling at cyclists. That sign they have on lorries \u2013 &quot;if you can&apos;t see my mirrors, I can&apos;t see you&quot; \u2013 appears to be less of a warning than a gauntlet, like that 30-second whistle muggers are meant to give you before they start chasing you. If drivers went any faster round my local roundabout, they would be trapped on it by centrifugal force. [see footnote] What this combustible situation needs is a really loud noise. A noise that can be heard over the loudest traffic, louder than a rock concert and as loud as a jet. If you had an aversion to loud noises, this is definitely the sort of noise you wouldn&apos;t like. My worry is that it will be a like a car horn in impact \u2013 nobody inside a vehicle will register it much, and pedestrians will bear the brunt, forced by their low status to exist inside an atonal symphony of anger and revenge. On the other hand, without a horn, if somebody cuts me up, I curse like a hellion, which is no picnic either for the passerby. It started with a technical hitch, which meant I hit the alarm every time I changed gear. This is when I noticed how bad most pedestrians&apos; hearing is \u2013 they get the 140 decibels, but they look for it in totally the wrong direction, often upwards. &quot;What&apos;s a tumble dryer doing in the sky?&quot; they think, as they step into the path of a flatbed truck. The first time I unleashed it on purpose was an all-time bus classic. He wanted to pull out \u2013 clearly, it is a bit annoying having to wait for all these cars. Surely there&apos;s a bylaw about all this? The traffic cleared except for me. &quot;Really, why wait?&quot; he was thinking. &quot;Are cyclists even allowed on the road? Shouldn&apos;t they be in Center Parcs, or in Amsterdam?&quot; I made my outlandish noise, and he actually stopped. The surprise element served me pretty well. Next was a pedestrian cutting across the road when it was my light, but that didn&apos;t really work. She got a shock but decided to carry on crossing. Her friend backed off to the kerb, shouting at her. The upshot is that it will have taken a two-unit group twice as long to cross a road, and they most probably will spend the rest of the day arguing. At this point I vowed not to use it on any more pedestrians, but that is a lot easier said than done, considering their wild habits. Outside a hospital, it&apos;s a loud-horn-owner&apos;s dream, a hotbed of inconsiderate pulling in and out and egregious occupation of the Keep Clear space. Then, thanks to an ambulance making even more noise than I was, it dawned on me that probably half the cars&apos; occupants were just about to give birth or bleed into their upholstery. But by then I was miles away, where I honked some people on Boris bikes for a laugh, and immediately felt guilty. Later a cab really did cut me up, and I honked him in anger, but took a belt-and-braces approach and swore at him as well. The one situation I couldn&apos;t test is the one that is most often fatal for cyclists \u2013 being on the wrong side of a lorry that turns left, not knowing you&apos;re there. You can make all the noise you like, but the cab is so far up, you can never tell if they&apos;ve registered, or if they can hear anything at all, over all that juddering and unwrapping of Yorkies. Generally, though, I can see the point, and it works: people often don&apos;t notice you when you&apos;re cycling, and the louder you are, the more they notice. But I feel as though it ups the ante, and next someone will invent a walker&apos;s catapult or a motorcyclist&apos;s airgun. \u2022 The following footnote was added on 2 November 2012: this article inverts the laws of physics in saying &quot;If drivers went any faster round my local roundabout, they would be trapped on it by centrifugal force&quot;.

Roberto Mancini&apos;s team are still unbeaten in the Premier League, and can proudly point to another three points picked up when not playing particularly well, which is not something they have always been able to boast about, but any other boast based on this display would be hollow. With only slightly better finishing Swansea would have earned at least a point, food for thought for a team that now needs three wins against Ajax, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. &quot;We deserved a point,&quot; Michael Laudrup said. &quot;They didn&apos;t create really big chances, we had the best ones. Their goal came out of nothing, it wasn&apos;t really a chance, but that&apos;s what champion teams can do to you.&quot; The Swansea manager&apos;s opposite number did not bother to pretend his side had played well. &quot;We were so tired,&quot; Mancini said. &quot;After the defeat in Europe this was a difficult moment for us, the only important thing was to win. We did that, we took three points. Now we can rest for a week.&quot; With a whopping 12 minutes and 38 seconds of added time after two second-half injuries, the game was officially the Premier League&apos;s longest ever, which will come as no surprise to anyone who watched it. It was slow to get properly started, with both teams passing the ball around midfield but failing to find any real penetration. Sergio Ag\u00fcero whisked purposefully past Chico Flores in the opening minutes without managing to open a route to goal, then Wayne Routledge did the same to Vincent Kompany at the other end, obliging the Manchester City captain to concede a foul. In the absence of goalmouth incident early on the chief talking point was an outrageous dive on the edge of the Manchester City penalty area by Angel Rangel, for which the Swansea full-back was correctly booked. Swansea are capable defenders, and when Gareth Barry wasted a rare opportunity to play Carlos Tevez into space behind the back line after half an hour it was a reminder of how much the home side are missing David Silva. The Spanish maestro is an expert at unlocking well-organised defences and without him Manchester City were predictable and somewhat short of ideas, with neither Tevez nor Ag\u00fcero as involved in the game as they would have liked. The visitors were content to contain and threaten danger on the break, which is exactly what they did with two separate thrusts upfield just before the interval. Manchester City got away with the first one at the expense of a booking for Micah Richards for a foul on Routledge, Kompany clearing Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez&apos;s eventual shot off the line, but Swansea should have taken the lead with the second when Joe Hart came off his line to smother a shot from Michu. It was a good stop by the goalkeeeper, yet Michu should have done better after staying onside to accept a wonderfully timed pass from Ki Sung-yueng. Manchester City&apos;s offside trap was well and truly sprung, yet just when it appeared scoring would be easier than missing a slightly heavy first touch from Michu gave Hart his chance. When Aleksandar Kolarov skied a free kick at the end of the first half a few boos were audible as the home side left the field. You never quite know when City fans are being ironic, but there certainly hadn&apos;t been much to cheer about in an underwhelming first half. Mancini conceded his side have a mountain to climb in Europe after defeat in Amsterdam in midweek \u2013 his cliche, not mine \u2013 and playing like this they will face an uphill task defending their Premier League title. Probably wisely, Mancini sent on Mario Balotelli for the second half, perhaps recognising that something was needed to enliven the proceedings, and with three at the front Manchester City quickly began to look more like their old selves. Ag\u00fcero shot too high as the second half opened, and Balotelli was unable to reach a cross from the right from Samir Nasri a couple of minutes later before appearing to be hampered by Flores as he attempted to reach another from Richards, but at least these efforts brought the crowd to its feet and turned up the background noise. During the first half Eastlands had been as quiet as a library, apart from the Swansea fans occasionally breaking the silence by saying so. Swansea were not going to take this lying down and once again gave their hosts a lesson in how to create a clear opportunity as the hour approached. Hern\u00e1ndez&apos;s cross from the right found Michu unmarked in front of goal, only for Swansea&apos;s leading scorer to squander another a good chance, directing his firm downward header straight at Hart. The visitors quickly came to rue their profligacy, for within a minute Manchester City had taken the lead, Tevez conjuring a goal from almost nothing by shooting on sight after doing well to control an overhit pass from Ga\u00ebl Clichy. Furthermore, the partially unsighted Michel Vorm was unable to continue after injuring himself in diving to try to keep out the shot. Typically generous, Manchester City offered Swansea the chance of an equaliser when Nasri&apos;s attempted clearance went straight to Jonathan de Guzman, though the midfielder could not quite summon Tevez&apos;s accuracy and his shot flew a couple of feet wide. Having survived that scare, the home side had to negotiate the last 16 minutes with Kolo Tour\u00e9 on in place of Richards, who collapsed on his own in the penalty area when his knee appeared to give way. Worrying about switching formations in mid-game suddenly does not appear to be Richards&apos;s greatest concern.", "sentences": ["Mancini conceded his side have a mountain to climb in Europe after defeat in Amsterdam in midweek \u2013 his cliche, not mine \u2013 and playing like this they will face an uphill task defending their Premier League title."], "title": "Manchester City 1-0 Swansea City | Premier League match report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/27/manchester-city-swansea-city-premier-league", "tags": ["Premier League", "Manchester City", "Swansea City", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-28T18:40:23Z", "article": "With its steel and plate glass facade, the interactive entertainment academy at the University of Central Florida looks as far from the grassy quadrangle and belltower of a traditional college as it&apos;s possible to get. Inside, small teams of students \u2013 artists, computer programmers and aspiring games producers \u2013 collaborate to acquire the skills needed to work in the video games industry. In one studio, a trio of students have created an iPad version of an Angry Birds-style game that involves firing dodos from a cannon. Kyle Martin, lead artist on the dodo game, had borrowed $33,000 in a federal loan to pay for his year&apos;s tuition. &quot;FIEA has a really great success rate in terms of who gets hired,&quot; he said. &quot;That by itself proves it&apos;s a great investment.&quot; The campus is in Orlando, a city that is best known for its proximity to the world&apos;s most popular amusement park but is increasingly a centre for hi-tech industry, film, TV and gaming. Ben Noel, director of the interactive entertainment academy, said: &quot;Orlando has grown up around agriculture and tourism, low wage jobs. The people who had opportunities around here were the children of bankers, real estate lawyers and real estate developers. &quot;As we grow, there&apos;s very much a focus on economic development and high wage jobs. We&apos;re trying to build that infrastructure.&quot; The US has one of the most highly educated workforces in the developed world. Across all age groups, only Canada, Israel, Japan and Russia have a higher proportion of college-educated workers. But many countries are catching up fast as more young people around the globe get an opportunity to go to university. According to the OECD, 42% of young Americans have a college education _ far behind the world leader, Korea, where 65% of young people have a degree. On current trends, the US will be overtaken by an increasing number of countries in coming years. In a flatter world, that creates competitive pressure. The Obama administration has set a goal that, by 2020, the US will have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. Democrats and Republicans agree that college should be more affordable and accessible, but differ on how to achieve this. President Obama has raised the maximum Pell grant award available in the next academic year. The grant, intended for the neediest students, is the federal government&apos;s single biggest expenditure on education; of the 16.4m undergraduates at US colleges in 2010, 58% received Pell grants. Mitt Romney argues that increased federal funding will feed the growth in college costs. He has indicated a narrowing of the Pell grant programme, saying that &quot;a Romney administration will refocus Pell grant dollars on the students that need them most&quot;. Romney says that he will support &quot;institutions that are pursuing innovative operating models to drive down costs&quot;. Obama acknowledges the need to curb college costs, but favours using federal money as an incentive for good behaviour. He has proposed that some federal aid will be shifted away from colleges that fail to hold down net tuition \u2013 the costs paid by students after taking grants into account. The money, $10bn annually, will be used to reward colleges that &quot;do their fair share&quot; to keep tuition affordable, the president says. Obama lobbied Congress this summer to extend the low interest rate on federal student loans, a move that was backed by Romney. Congress voted to extend the 3.4% rate on Stafford loans for another year - the interest rate would otherwise have doubled. Meanwhile, state funding for public universities is under intense pressure. State government budgets have been squeezed by spending on programmes like Medicaid, the healthcare scheme for the poor. Universities, which can plug their funding gap by charging students more for tuition, are obvious targets for spending cuts. Between 1992 and 2010, state funding dropped from 38% of public universities&apos; total revenue to an average of 23%. Enrolment at public universities has gone up while state funding has fallen by 20% per student in the past decade, according to the National Science Board, which advises the government on science policy. The erosion of state support is keenly felt at the University of Central Florida. With over 50,000 students enroled, it is the second largest university in the US, after Arizona State. Last year, for the first time, the university&apos;s share of funding from tuition exceeded the proportion it received from the state. In Florida as a whole, public funding per student has fallen by 19% in the past decade, according to the National Science Board figures. University provost Tony Waldrop said: &quot;One of our goals is to provide access to students who are qualified to go to college. We don&apos;t see our job as to figure out how to deny people a college degree but rather to provide access to that opportunity. &quot;We could just cap enrolment, and then we wouldn&apos;t have this problem, but if we cap enrolment that by definition means we&apos;re going to deny students an opportunity to get a college education without going out of state.&quot; Instead, the university has cut courses, increased class sizes and is offering more education online. A third of UCF&apos;s student credit hours \u2013 which count towards graduation \u2013 are either completely or partially online, the provost says. This figure grows every year. Waldrop said: &quot;At a time when we were growing very rapidly, and growing rapidly so we could meet the demand for access to colleges here in Florida, we were also getting cuts, so the biggest impact has been not being able to hire faculty at the same rate we were increasing in size. So something we&apos;re concerned about is our student to faculty ratio is not where we would like it to be.&quot; Average class sizes are now between 40 and 48 students, the university&apos;s management estimates. Five courses, ranging from radiology to actuarial science, have gone \u2013 in some cases because of low enrolments but also because they were available at local community colleges. It remains a comprehensive university offering a vast array of courses from art history to neuroscience. The giant main campus - featuring a 10,000 seat arena where graduation ceremonies are held - feels like a self-contained citadel within Orlando. A further squeeze on government funding; if, for example, eligibility for Pell grants is narrowed, could have a serious impact on the university&apos;s mission. &quot;If the Pell grant programme is limited, disadvantaged students are not going to be able to afford to come to UCF,&quot; the provost said. &quot;And if they can&apos;t afford UCF \u2013 we&apos;re already one of the cheapest in the country.&quot;     At UCF, tuition fees for the current academic year are just under $6,000 for Florida residents on undergraduate courses. Photograph: Paul Hennessy/Polaris    With a growing public backlash against the scale of student debt \u2013 which now exceeds credit card debt \u2013 public universities have little room for manoeuvre. At UCF, tuition fees for the current academic year are just under $6,000 for Florida residents on undergraduate courses, and just under $22,000 for out-of-state students. America has a diverse higher education system, and public universities are not the only option. Romney wants to encourage private provision of college education, indicating that he will deregulate this sector. The candidates&apos; attitude to private for-profit colleges has emerged as an effective dividing line in the presidential race. The Obama administration has passed regulations that require for-profit colleges to demonstrate &quot;gainful employment&quot; among their graduates \u2013 the measures include being able to demonstrate that at least 35% of former students are actively paying down loans. Romney has said he will do away with this &quot;ill-advised regulation&quot;. The Romney plan says: &quot;the federal government should allow consumers in the market to make their own choices while providing the information to make those choices well.&quot; A Romney remark that students should &quot;shop around&quot; and borrow more money from their parents was seized on in Democrat campaign ads as an example of the gap between the Republican candidate and ordinary lives. The president has portrayed himself and his wife as beneficiaries of affordable state-backed education. On the campaign trail Romney has praised the for-profit Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida, noting that they run classes 24 hours a day &quot;because physical structure is expensive&quot;. Romney said: &quot;They hold down the cost of their education by recognising they&apos;re competing. We&apos;re going to have to have greater competition among institutions of higher learning and I believe that they&apos;re going to have to become productive. &quot;Two of the places that are least productive in our society, have done less to improve their cost and quality are healthcare and higher education. Bringing the dynamics of competition to those marketplaces in my view is the best way to bring down cost.&quot; A private model with higher tuition  Full Sail, which is less than seven miles from UCF, has steeper tuition rates than the public university. A degree course in Digital Arts and Design, for example, costs $80,000 for a 21 month course. However, a spokeswoman argued that as the university&apos;s courses are taken at an accelerated pace, students saved on living costs. She said: &quot;Our students are potentially in their career earlier, they&apos;ve saved money on up to two additional years of living as a college student, and they&apos;ve been more aggressively prepared for the non-stop pace of the entertainment industry.&quot; Full Sail is a specialist institution focused on the entertainment industry; its alumni include an Oscar winner, Gary Rizzo, who was honoured for his sound mixing work on the Christopher Nolan film Inception. At last year&apos;s Grammys, the five nominees were all mixed or engineered by Full Sail graduates. It offers students lavish facilities \u2013 there are more than a dozen sound stages to shoot film and television, music recording studios that meet professional standards, and outdoor movie sets recreating Amsterdam, Venice and New York. Its website publishes detailed statistics about student outcomes, including how many get jobs in their chosen profession \u2013 for the digital arts and design course, the success rate was 78% of the 222 students who graduated in 2009-10. Full Sail provides a fast track into the entertainment business for many of its students, but its high tuition costs mean it is unlikely to provide a realistic alternative for students from less affluent homes. Asked about the university&apos;s student profile, the spokeswoman said: &quot;We do not track the socio-economic background of our students and we do not encourage or discourage students based on their socio-economic background. Also, due to our student privacy policy, we do not publish information of this nature.&quot; Like the music industry and the media, traditional universities face a challenge from the disruptive power of the internet. Increasingly, traditional universities have felt the need to cover their internet flank by offering courses online. Harvard and MIT have launched the edX platform while a number of elite universities including Princeton and Johns Hopkins have joined the online education platform Coursera. The provost of UCF accepts that the expansion of virtual learning will provide mounting competition for universities like his.

There has been widespread scepticism in the media industry about the proposals, with even the investment banker Nicholas Shott questioning the commercial viability of local TV services outside major conurbations in a report commissioned by Hunt. Ofcom received 57 bids for 19 of the 21 local TV licences it initially advertised and nine have been so far been awarded (for Belfast, Brighton, Bristol, Cardiff, Grimsby, Norwich, Nottingham, Sheffield and Southampton) Awarding the licences is Ofcom&apos;s panel, led by the former BBC and Channel 4 executive Tim Gardam. All the local TV services in England will be broadcast on channel 8 on Freeview and channel 17 on Sky. The BBC is providing \u00a325m for infrastructure and \u00a35m a year over three years towards content costs for all local TV services. But if there is one place that local television could work, it will be the nation&apos;s capital. One of the London bidders suggested the licence could be worth &quot;tens of millions&quot; three or four years into its 12-year lifespan. Besides its attractions for advertisers, the capital has the added advantage of being a defined region \u2013 meaning that viewing figures can be provided by Barb (bidders in areas outside London have been told by the government to come up with a suitable measurement system of their own). London8&apos;s Hornsby argues the capital can sustain a local TV service, pointing out he is based in Amsterdam, which has two local stations servicing a population of just 600,000 people. His London8 is billing itself as offering the most local bid, with comedy and entertainment. Its team is based in the Riverside Studios in west London, led by the former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson with backers including ITN, Time Out and the Press Association. The London8 bid, which promises to revitalise the historic Riverside Studios, aims to be &quot;a TV version of a tweet&quot; for people to dip in and out of. The team use the word &quot;fun&quot; a lot and cite the long-lost ITV regional structure as an inspiration. Hornsby&apos;s business partner, William Burdett-Coutts, admits that it will be &quot;tricky&quot; for any of the bids to turn a profit, but he is confident London8&apos;s can. The competing LondonTV bid is backed by the regional newspaper publishers Archant, Tindle and Trinity Mirror and involves the former ITV News executives Clive Jones and David Mannion. Its chief executive, Horwood, a former Trinity Mirror executive, has been trying to launch local TV in London for 20 years and is confident Ofcom will accept his bid&apos;s argument \u2013 that local TV only works if it is supported by other content, which LondonTV will get from a production company it has signed a deal with (but won&apos;t name). The bid also includes a multimillion-pound annual budget for more programming in addition to the minimum commitments, and that could well include quality, non-news commissions. &quot;Exclusively local programming on a channel, whether it&apos;s a cat up a tree or anything else, doesn&apos;t work commercially, you have to mix it with high-quality entertainment programming, that drives viewers and is attractive to advertisers, to fund the local programming,&quot; says Horwood. The other bidders are the Evening Standard&apos;s London Live \u2013 which is planning to use its print resources and free marketing in the capital&apos;s daily freesheet. Next are two &quot;multi-city&quot; hopefuls that have also applied for other local TV licences. The first is Made in London \u2013 chaired by the former BSkyB executive Ian West with backers including Time Out (again) and Ambassador Theatre Group. It is promising to cater for the city&apos;s diverse population, including shows for the elderly and covering gay and lesbian issues. Completing the line up YourTV London, headed by the former Tory MP Steven Norris. YourTV London is emphasising citizen journalism, promising video diaries, amateur sports reports and uploaded, on-the-spot coverage of events. Sources suggest most of the bids are running at budgets of around \u00a310m a year. Burdett-Coutts wants advertisers to be able to get on air for about \u00a35,000, with a guarantee of around 28 ad spots, and hopes that 25% will be small local businesses. He adds that he expects to sell \u00a36m worth of ads in the first year \u2013 taking a hit initially but turning a profit after three years. &quot;The margins are tight. It has to look good,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody will stomach badly made programmes and no decent programmes means no advertising.&quot; Thomas Joseph, an analyst at Enders Analysis, says that &quot;London is easily the largest prize&quot; among the local TV licences up for grabs. &quot;It will be easier to sell advertising in London \u2013 but they will have problems in the regions. It is going to be very difficult to create commercially viable local TV stations outside the very large cities. &quot;It remains to be seen which way Ofcom will go, but in London all the bidders claim to be commercially viable\u00a0and they have probably the best chance of realising that.&quot; Local television, he says, offers bidders &quot;the advantage of getting into video content with potentially very cheap distribution on digital terrestrial TV \u2013 no wonder they are attracted to it&quot;. And neither he nor the London bidders appeared worried that Hunt, the great champion of local TV, is now in a different job, replaced as culture secretary by Maria Miller. &quot;It is a great idea which he has set in motion, nothing can change it,&quot; says Burdett-Coutts. &quot;The concept is great but the tricky thing is for it to add up.&quot; The five bidders London8 Adamant that it&apos;s the most local bid. London8 will operate from the west London studios where classic shows such as Hancock&apos;s Half Hour were made, and the bid assumes costs will be low. It is also promising entertainment, comedy and theatre every night of the week. With ITV&apos;s former entertainment supremo Paul Jackson and the entrepreneur and former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson on board, it claims it has the programme-making expertise required. LondonTV (the Channel 6 Consortium) It has a very &quot;hard news&quot; approach to London, with David Mannion (editor-in-chief of ITV News for 10 years) as head of news, supported by the hundreds of local journalists working for the three backers: Archant, Tindle and Trinity Mirror. While it offers less overall local content \u2013 a still-ambitious 2,000 hours a year rather than the 6,000 promised by its main competitors \u2013 much less of it will be repeats.News output will be surrounded by high-quality entertainment programming, sourced from a so-far unnamed partner, to drive up viewing and advertising revenues, as it argues this is the only way local channels are commercially successful around the world. London Live (London Evening Standard) The bid is led by an eight-person management board, including the paper&apos;s chairman, Evgeny Lebedev, its editor, Sarah Sands, and the Standard&apos;s managing director, Andrew Mullins. Other backers of the bid include Peter Bennett-Jones (ex-Tiger Aspect) and the former Ofcom boss Stephen Carter. A lot of the news will be covered from the newsroom of London&apos;s evening newspaper and the cost of the bid is in effect being underwritten by the Lebedevs. An 18-hour daily schedule is planned initially, with news making up 28 of the 49 hours of new content each week (much of it quite laden with travel news for commuters). Other bells and whistles in the bid include the promise of \u00a35m of free marketing in the Standard, plus daily listings in the paper. Made in London Led by James Conway, a former TV executive in Ireland, who is a 45% shareholder in the venture, its submission ticks a lot of boxes \u2013 enthusing about the &quot;rainbow&quot; nature of London, for example \u2013 and proposes a different approach to crime, a local TV staple. &quot;Rather than reporting every stabbing for the sake of it, we will talk to London gangs, discuss their grievances, seek solutions and talk to knife-crime victims,&quot; it says. One programme, called Grey Matter, will cater for the elderly and another will cover gay and lesbian issues. Behind the bid is a team of advisers including the former Emap boss Tom Moloney and the investigative journalist Donal MacIntyre, who will be given his own current affairs show. One of two &quot;multi-city&quot; bids. YourTV London Led by the former Tory MP and London mayoral candidate Steve Norris, the second multi-city bidder offers a clear news-led proposition with a stress on citizen journalism \u2013 and also includes a books programme at the heart of its schedule. Promising video diaries, amateur sports reports and uploaded on-the-spot coverage of events, it makes a point of saying &quot;our audience will be a significant part of the programme-making process&quot;; and calls viewers &quot;our ambassadors as well as our stars&quot;.

Manchester City overhauled their management team on Sunday by appointing Txiki Begiristain as director of football. The former Spain international occupied the same position at Barcelona for seven years and will assume responsibility for transfers. The football administrator Brian Marwood, previously in charge of recruitment, has been moved sideways to become the managing director of the club&apos;s academy in a move overseen by City&apos;s new chief executive, Ferran Soriano, who worked with Begiristain at the Camp Nou. &quot;Given the scale and importance of this challenge, we want to commit our very best people to it,&quot; Soriano said. &quot;I am delighted Brian Marwood will take leadership of the CFA initiative and I am equally very pleased to welcome an individual of Begiristain&apos;s calibre. I have no doubt that together, and in support of Mancini, they will be a formidable team.&quot; Mancini and Marwood may not have been; they endured a fractious relationship, especially when the manager&apos;s preferred transfer targets eluded him in the summer. Yet change is a constant where Mancini is concerned. While Claudio Ranieri tinkered and Rafa Ben\u00edtez rotated, Mancini meddles, incessantly and, according to his critics, needlessly. The Italian is an obsessive, compulsive decision-maker, unable to let a game evolve without his interference. Against Swansea, as in Amsterdam three days earlier, he switched the shape and altered the individuals in his team and, once again,\u00a0he got a reaction from the dressing\u00a0room. This time, however, it was a seal of approval. &quot;It was a good change,&quot; said Gareth Barry after a half-time reshuffle when Sergio Ag\u00fcero was redirected to the left, Mario Balotelli brought on to lead the line and Carlos T\u00e9vez ordered to operate behind the Italian. &quot;Carlos pressed the holding midfielders and put them under a lot of pressure,&quot; Barry said. &quot;The period we were on top in the second half was probably down to that.&quot; If Ajax profited from one of Mancini&apos;s radical rethinks, this time City were the beneficiaries. &quot;It&apos;s nice to talk about a positive one,&quot; Barry added, noting it was the second successive league game shaped by Mancini. &quot;He made an attacking decision at West Brom and [Edin] Dzeko came on and scored two goals. Those things don&apos;t get spoken about.&quot; Indeed, City&apos;s adrenaline-fuelled surge to the title owed much to Mancini&apos;s mid-match input. Telling substitutions against Chelsea, Newcastle and QPR were reasons for eventual, vital victories. This season&apos;s narrative has been different. With his fondness for a three-man backline, Mancini has been charged with breaking something that did not require fixing. &quot;The manager wanted a Plan B,&quot; Barry said. &quot;The players didn&apos;t seem to be overly confident playing it but, if the manager wants to go with it, you have to do your best.&quot; And Mancini remains undeterred. Switching to three central defenders was an attacking gambit that backfired against Ajax and a way of shutting up shop against Swansea. When Joleon Lescott was introduced, City finished with five defenders. Just a second clean sheet of the season was secured before, having frustrated the Swans, Vincent Kompany turned his attention to his accusers. Defiance is his default setting and Kompany denied his form has suffered \u2013 &quot;I feel good,&quot; he said \u2013 and, while a former rebel, in T\u00e9vez, delivered the winner, he denied reports of a modern-day mutiny in the City camp. &quot;The stories are based on things that I can&apos;t even relate to,&quot; he said. &quot;I question the integrity of anyone who would write this. It&apos;s sensationalism, nothing more.&quot; Siege mentalities tend to be features of title-winning teams in Manchester and it appears another is being constructed. &quot;I have been at City four and a half years and can&apos;t say I have had many moments where we have had the whole country singing our praises,&quot; the Belgian said. &quot;I don&apos;t listen to criticism. It doesn&apos;t affect me. I wouldn&apos;t expect the manager to be affected by it.&quot; Mancini may not be affected but he is aware of it. Knowing his growing reputation as a hardline disciplinarian, the manager joked that he shot only three players after a wretched first-half display. Actually his response was entirely in character. He meddled. And once again his intervention was influential.

The red line is itself a work of art, an installation by the contemporary artist Henk Schut, who had to seek permission from 88 different civil servants and 253 individuals to anchor his cable three metres above the pavements, by hundreds of steel fixings attaching it to offices, houses, lampposts and shops, crossing the canals three times, clearing tram lines and electrical cables.

Red route \u2026 Henk Schut installing the Van Gogh Mile. Photograph: Martijn van den Dobbelsteen/Artery Foundation    There are little surprises to watch out for along the way, including a vegetable shop with a bronze cast of Van Gogh&apos;s boots upside down at the top of the window. The owners were so proud at being included that they redecorated the entire shop to celebrate. Anyone armed with an iPhone or iPad can add an extra dimension: at several points along the route, the free Van Gogh Mile app transforms the everyday scene, causing thousands of sunflowers to bloom in the museum square, or a sleepy corner metamorphosise into a night scene at Arles, scene of the disastrous rift with the painter Paul Gauguin, and one of the most famous episodes in art history, when Van Gogh cut off part of his own ear. Along the route walkers are ambushed by recorded voices suddenly speaking from gratings, doorways or sheds, extracts from Van Gogh&apos;s own writings. At some junctions the cable criss-crosses, containing the view in a perspective frame such as Van Gogh himself used.           Once safely guided to the Hermitage, the visitor will find all Van Gogh&apos;s most celebrated paintings on the walls; the sunflowers, the rush-seated chair in his little house in Arles. The last room has the ominous black crows rising from the fields of the last landscape he knew, before he staggered back from those same fields one day in 1890 with gaping gunshot wounds, a suicide or, some have recently suggested, a murder victim, aged 37. The Van Gogh museum has never attempted such a display before. Drawings and paintings are mixed with objects Van Gogh owned and painted which have never been on view, including a family Bible, and a wobbly drawing with the little model horse he was attempting to copy. The paintings are hung on walls painted intense colours \u2013 ochre, Chinese lacquer red, thunder cloud grey \u2013 so different from the original, sternly neutral backdrops but so successful in their effect that it may be imitated when the pictures return home. On the Hermitage side, until January, there is a spectacular exhibition of impressionist masterpieces, including a dazzling wall of Monets, the kind of pictures Van Gogh first saw when he went to Paris and which transformed his own art, the muddy colours of his early work giving way to brilliant blues, greens and yellows. One canvas is shown for the first time in a double-sided case, revealing how Van Gogh painted a typically early murky scene on one side, and only a few months later, unable to afford more canvas, painted a self portrait on the back in his sizzling new colours. Poor Van Gogh, who never had a permanent home in his adult life, hated moving house. He once wrote: &quot;Moving is causing me some considerable concern these days, because it&apos;s never straightforward. All the same, it will have to happen, if not now then later.&quot; That&apos;s precisely the conclusion the directors of the Van Gogh museum reached. It opened 40 years ago to house the biggest collection of works by the man who never sold a painting in his lifetime, but is now one of the best-loved and most expensive artists ever. The museum holds 200 paintings, 600 drawings, and 800 of some of the best letters ever written, mostly heavily illustrated, near-daily correspondence with his brother Theo \u2013 almost always ending with a plea for money \u2013 in which the gauche, socially awkward man poured out his thoughts, dreams, gossip, theories on art and life, and details of work in progress: he wrote of one wintry view of the garden of the asylum where he spent some of his last months that he had used &quot;green saddened with grey&quot;. The museum was built for about 250,000 visitors a year, and last year had 1.6 million. Everything from the air conditioning to the shop was being overwhelmed by sheer numbers. The staff first thought they could gradually renew the building around the visitors, but last year decided they needed to empty it of paintings and people and get all the work done: &quot;Not a piece of news that as a museum director you ever want to learn,&quot; Axel Ruger said. It&apos;s a mark of the success of the museum that to the last day the crowds kept coming. As the paintings went into store and the galleries emptied they gradually cut the admission prices, but even on the last day, with only one floor open and little left on the walls \u2013 &quot;a very generous hang&quot;, Ruger said wryly \u2013 there was a queue outside in the rain at opening time. The staff have set themselves an awesomely tight schedule. They have promised to be open again by 1 May 2013, in time for the 40th anniversary of the museum, the 160th of Van Gogh&apos;s birth, and a slew of local anniversaries including the 400th anniversary of Amsterdam&apos;s famous ring of canals, now crossed and recrossed by the red line of the Van Gogh mile. &quot;We hope visitors will find we are the same \u2013 but much better,&quot; Ruger said. &quot;2013 will be a sparkling season.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 30 October 2012.

And who could argue with that? A city in a garden? Like disagreeing with motherhood and apple pie. Given that few people are familiar with the the work of Ebenezer Howard or the concept of the garden city, although rather more have appreciatively trod the streets of Welwyn Garden City and Letchworth, it&apos;s perhaps worth thinking about what the phrase really means. The original garden city movement, which has attracted interest from the likes of David Cameron and Grant Shapps, was far more than a call for nice gardens and a few pleasant bay windows. It was a manifesto for an entirely new Britain, one that can only be understood in the context of Edwardian anxieties. And it was rather more reactionary than you might think. The early 1900s was a period of rapid social change, exemplified by female emancipation and the suffragette movement. There was a great deal of anxiety about the breakdown of the traditional family, and the morals of those living in cramped urban conditions. It is no surprise that the garden city movement placed so much emphasis on individual and private family dwellings. At the time, Germany was overtaking Britain industrially, and conscription for the Boer war had been a disaster, with huge numbers of potential recruits rejected as they were simply too unhealthy and undernourished to fight. The contrast with well-fed South African farmers was telling. People pointed fingers at the appalling conditions in the cities, and called for an emphasis on gardens, cultivation and healthy food. Reading the literature on London, now the economic dynamo of the nation and hailed as the greatest city in the world, it is hard to comprehend how much the place was hated just a century ago. The solution was to &quot;do the city in&quot; and return to the country, to a civilisation of self-organising towns of a few tens of thousands. Very astutely, activist Jane Jacobs noted the similarity between the garden city plans and the typical English country town. Howard was not quite as original as his proponents suggest. The Arts and Crafts movement was a reaction against what it saw as the horrors of industrialisation and the modern world, and its godfather, William Morris, was a huge influence. His book, News from Nowhere, imagines London vanishing, to be replaced by a civilisation based on cultivation and crafts. Meanwhile, there is an age-old tradition in England, dating back to the capital&apos;s Bloomsbury squares, of trying to bring the qualities of the country into the town. Today the majority of housing is influenced in some way by the first garden city movement \u2013 the streets of 1930s houses with gardens are just a watered-down version of the Letchworth aesthetic. It could be argued that every housebuilder in the country has been trying to build their version of this common ideal ever since. The point of all this is to ask exactly how relevant or, indeed, different the idea of the garden city is today. We might like the architecture and the greenery, but does the population really hate London? The young people crowding into Shoreditch and Hackney, places that housing reformers used to hate, don&apos;t seem to. At a time when economists emphasise the benefits of agglomeration and density, do we really need to decentralise? London&apos;s world city status \u2013 so important to our economy \u2013 depends upon providing modern, spacious dwellings in its heart, not new settlements in the outer home counties. Family structures have changed, with people marrying later. Gardening is not quite the obsession it was, and younger people do not have quite so much of the yearning for the countryside that characterised earlier generations. We can enjoy the architecture of the garden city movement while recognising that we enjoy cities far more than our Edwardian ancestors. The solution is to build garden suburbs as extensions to our existing cities, providing much-needed family housing. This is far more sustainable than creating new settlements far away from existing employment. Meanwhile, we should also think hard about how we can make central London as attractive a place for families as Paris or New York, or help Birmingham and Manchester to compete with Munich, Amsterdam or Toulouse. The very last thing we need is another dose, albeit heavily disguised, of an age-old English rural fantasy.

Nothing lasts unless it is constantly renewed. Fresh interpretations and major additions to the chamber music repertoire are vital to keep music alive. Our 2012/13 season will deliver more than 30 world and national premieres, together with extensive surveys of the chamber works of George Benjamin, Huw Watkins and Simon Bainbridge. New work is vital for a venue such as Wigmore, which must retain its position as a leading commissioner of chamber music compositions. It would be bad for us, bad for our audience and bad for London, and the sector at large if we didn&apos;t continue to invest in new music. New commissions can&apos;t happen without funding, so how do you get the message out to funders and friends? The most effective way of getting the message out is by commissioning new works of quality. Audiences and donors will always want to support quality and innovation \u2013 by making commissioning central to the ethos of an artistic institution, a clear message is sent and donations will follow. You first saw the Wigmore Hall job in the Guardian \u2013 were you perusing a new career? I wasn&apos;t specifically looking for a new job; I was at home in bed recovering from food poisoning and my brother brought me a copy of the Guardian. I saw a notice for the executive director position, working alongside William Lyne. He was to retain artistic responsibilities, but hand everything else over to an executive director who was expected to manage the Hall&apos;s marketing and fundraising arms, as well as the operation of the building, and prepare for and lead a major refurbishment. I was 27 years old at the time and decided to throw my hat in the ring as I seemed to have all the relevant experience. I was working at the \u00a3300m ExCel Centre in the Docklands and had also spent three years working on events and concerts at Harrogate International Centre. ExCel was a wonderful project but my heart was always in music. You became director at 32, the youngest ever leader of a major concert hall \u2013 to what do you credit your speedy ascent? The fact I worked at Wigmore from the age of 27 as joint chief executive put me in a good position to take on the artistic role when both jobs were re-amalgamated in 2005. Already at the Hall, I had led a major fundraising campaign and the successful \u00a33m refurbishment of the building \u2013 the board, artists and audiences knew me and had confidence in me and my track record, so that helped too. You&apos;ve previously said that you &quot;have to deal with artists and agents and staff in all their infinite variety&quot; \u2013 who comes first in your priorities? Artists always come first. My good relationship with artists is key to the Hall&apos;s current success. Since 2006 ticket sales have increased from 120,000 to over 190,000 last season. By fostering good communication with artists and their agents you can plan successful seasons. Wigmore Hall must continue to be a hub of innovation and original thinking. Through my friendship with artists, I encourage them to see the musical world in their own way. I promote individual artists&apos; independence of mind and together we can plan exciting contributions to our programming. As far as I am concerned, Wigmore Hall will always be a work in progress, where the future is exhilarating. Wigmore Hall is innovating, from in-house record labels to late night concerts \u2013 where do you take your cues on this? I can&apos;t exactly say where I take my cues from. Talking to other directors of halls in Amsterdam, Vienna, New York and promoters from all over the world is an important part of the job. By exchanging information and ideas we help each other out, but most of the ideas have to come from the artistic leader of each institution. You need to create projects that are different from those going on at other international halls and that also punch above what is going on locally. You are never really off duty, constantly thinking and innovating. Our audiences expect to hear keystones of Austro-German chamber repertoire, but I also want to introduce them to new experiences, especially in the early music and contemporary music worlds, often fusing both of those worlds together. Does the classical music world worry too much about cultivating younger audiences? Cultivating young audiences is of prime importance, but should not detract from attracting audiences from all walks of life and increasing attendance across the ages. The over-50 population in this country has never been larger. Is it a crime to cultivate audiences that might begin to come to concerts at 50 and continue until they are 80 years old or more? I don&apos;t think so \u2013 I often meet newcomers, couples in their fifties, and I ask them why they didn&apos;t come more often in their thirties or forties. They tell me their children have moved away now, that they don&apos;t work as hard and now have more time. I ask my peers in their late thirties why they don&apos;t come more often, and they respond: &quot;We work until 8pm, we have to arrange babysitters and it&apos;s too difficult to get to concerts more than two or three times a year.&quot; Audiences are constantly being renewed and refreshed. Let&apos;s not ring the death knell of classical music just yet. I wish the message would reach those pundits who recite the same tired old requiem for classical music. It&apos;s not dead \u2013 it&apos;s not dying. I could have told my board that the classical audience was contracting, that we&apos;d do well simply to hold the existing box-office figures. We could have ditched future vision, put on a few lecture recitals and comedy gigs and accepted that decline was inevitable. But we didn&apos;t do that \u2013 we&apos;ve raised ticket sales by 60%, and our radio broadcasts attract a substantial listenership both at home and abroad. I&apos;m sick of the bellyaching from certain media quarters. So much of what I read from certain commentators is misleading, often false and incredibly damaging. What does the next year hold in store for the sector? It certainly has been a tough year for the arts. We are all trying to increase our revenue sources, ticket sales, fundraising, commercial income and so on, to mitigate any public funding losses. I can&apos;t predict the future but hope that the changing of the guard at ACE and DCMS results in a renewed focus on quality and on the support of organisations that champion and produce excellence. Finally, when and where are you happiest in your job? I think that&apos;s a very difficult question to answer. There is nothing like the elation you feel when a concert you have worked so hard to put together or a debut recital goes well. Encouraging and developing young artists is one of the most rewarding parts of this job. There is nothing as good as the satisfaction and quiet pride that one takes in watching them succeed.

That&apos;s what the New York Times recently headlined its piece, and Kunle Afolayan&apos;s ambitions to shake up the industry now known (more great expectations) as Nollywood. With three films under his belt since he started directing in 2005 \u2013 which, by frantic west-African standards, makes him more the Kubrick of Lagos \u2013 the 38-year-old has become a byword for elevated quality: shooting on 35mm, releasing in cinemas, trying to improve on horribly stilted Nollywood formulas that seem to place more emphasis on gaudy soft furnishings than on dialogue and camerawork. Actually, Afolayan would prefer it if you called him the Mel Gibson of Lagos. &quot;I always show Apocalypto to my crew, because of the language thing. I say to them: &apos;You don&apos;t necessarily have to shoot your film in English for it to be good. You can do Swahili, you can do any language, you can even do no language at all.&apos;&quot; Gibson&apos;s not an obvious renaissance-man idol \u2013 but crossing boundaries, having international aspirations, is the path forward for Afolayan and what is becoming known as the New Nollywood. The old Nollywood had no time for film festivals. When I speak to the director, he&apos;s just touched down in Amsterdam for the Africa in the Picture jamboree, where he is shopping his comedy drama Phone Swap. Next up is London, for the Film Africa festival. &quot;I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s the perfect film. I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s the best thing that&apos;s ever happened to Nollywood. But it&apos;s totally different to what everyone else has done,&quot; Afolayan says of Phone Swap. It goes without saying that it&apos;s shot on film \u2013 a must for any hope of international distribution. And it has what sounds like the sort of sparky commercial premise that will give it high-concept traction beyond Nigerian borders: a country girl and a Lagos businessman fall in love in absentia after they pick up each other&apos;s BlackBerrys at the airport. Afolayan says he tried to steer clear of the overripe visual humour and slapstick that has dogged traditional Nollywood comedy. Phone Swap is a departure for Afolayan, as well as the industry. His first two movies, Irapada (Redemption) and Araromire (The Figurine), were self-originated stories rooted in juju, the supernatural folklore tales Naija audiences never tire of. But he had to pitch for Phone Swap at an advertising agency, who were taking proposals on behalf of Samsung, who saw a branded Nigerian feature as a piece of potentially hot marketing in the last half of the noughties, when Nollywood was really hitting the global consciousness. Samsung later dropped out, but Afolayan, who won the pitch, went ahead with other corporate sponsors, most importantly BlackBerry. His various &quot;partners&quot; provided about 40% of the $500,000 budget; the rest came from his bank loans and his own pocket. Afolayan has few of the artistic hangups about taking corporate money that exist in the west \u2013 which isn&apos;t surprising when money is so difficult to raise and to recoup. New Nollywood budgets, driven by well-to-do production values, are beginning to creep beyond $500,000, but the lack of cinema screens in Nigeria (there are currently 10 mainstream cinemas) makes good returns far from certain. The Figurine only took about two-thirds of its budget back. Mahmood Ali-Balogun&apos;s recent marital drama Tango with Me, also earmarked as a possible international breakout, failed to break even too. In fact, it&apos;s rare for any local film to take more than $200,000, according a report compiled for Unesco by Nollywood expert Rob Aft. There&apos;s an ingrained perception in Nigeria that anything other than the traditional Nollywood model \u2013 no-frills budgets between $15,000 and $75,000, and a smash-and-grab 14-day distribution window on VCD \u2013 is doomed to failure. That conservatism, most entrenched in the producing guilds who form Nollywood&apos;s power base, is what Afolayan is aiming to overcome. Ten more cinemas are on the way, and he thinks that will be enough to make New Nollywood-level budgets viable. &quot;I&apos;d say we are pretty close. Even if your budget is $1m, you should be able to recoup it in the country. Because we have a huge market, and they know what they want, and when they see it, they go for it.&quot; He reckons The Figurine \u2013 which has some bursts of cinematic flair that suggest its director may indeed have been scrutinising Mel of the Jungle \u2013 made other producers take notice. Evidence suggests that Nollywood&apos;s turnover has dropped by at least 50% over the last couple of years \u2013 perhaps a sign that the days of profligate output are ending. Phone Swap, released in Nigeria in March, has made 80% of its costs back, with DVD and foreign releases still to come; another message to Nollywood that quality pays. Afolayan&apos;s reforms are motivated by childhood memories of a golden age: he is the seventh of the 25 children of Adeyemi &quot;Love&quot; Afolayan, a postwar theatre and cinema impresario who had 10 wives and died in 1996. Afolayan Jr grew up accompanying his father on &quot;carnivalesque&quot; 1970s film shoots that often featured thousands of extras and lasted two or three months. &quot;I grew up seeing how film was properly done,&quot; he says. &quot;I had no idea what film-making was all about, but I saw the commitment from actors, I saw the commitment from crew.&quot; But the infant Nigerian film industry collapsed due to the lack of a feasible economic model, and didn&apos;t recover until the mid-1990s, when cheap video technology gave rise to Nollywood. The director trained as a banker, but got into the film business in 2005, initially as an actor. Amid the Nollywood mania, resisting the urge to direct wasn&apos;t easy. &quot;I wanted to stop complaining about what people did: let me see what I can make out of it. What you can do to start out is to capitalise on what people are not doing right. No matter how little it is, even it&apos;s just one step ahead.&quot; Nollywood could be about to take a giant step ahead, thanks to that recollection of the glory days. Afolayan is aiming to shoot October 1st, a serial killer movie set in 1960 against the backdrop of Nigerian independence, in February, but he is trying to secure a foreign co-producer outside the country first, to better his international chances. &quot;It is difficult to get a mainstream distribution deal, no matter how fantastic your film is, because it&apos;s a cartel, it&apos;s a clique,&quot; he says, &quot;If you don&apos;t belong, it&apos;s tough.&quot; His battle to set an economic precedent for Nollywood phase II could be as important as anything he puts up on the screen itself \u2013 and with his background in finance, he&apos;s well placed to achieve his goal. Werner Herzog once said that the ecstatic truth \u2013 the poet&apos;s kind \u2013 trumps the accountant&apos;s truth. But just try running an industry on ecstasy alone. \u2022 Phone Swap is showing at Film Africa on 10 November. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood will examine the politics of South Korea&apos;s blockbusters.

And, from Louis Vuitton to Topshop, the &quot;secretary&quot; look has remained popular over the last few years. This fashion originated in a time when there were few attractive career options open to women, but becoming a flight attendant was one of them. The cabin aisle quickly became a place for fashions \u00e0 la mode, and that tapered office look took to the skies as young women embraced the opportunity to get out of the typing pool and travel the world. The women serving the Don Drapers of the day their in-flight old fashioneds wore beige skirt suits, complete with pillbox hats and salmon-coloured scarfs or, a couple of years later, bright-red minidresses. We know this because we can see them in Cliff Muskiet&apos;s vast collection of flight-attendant uniforms. The 47-year-old Dutchman has been collecting cabin-crew uniforms for more than 20 years, photographing them and putting them up on his website. The fashion world often turns to nostalgia for inspiration, and Muskiet&apos;s collection takes that obsession with retro style to a whole new level. He now has more than 1,000 pieces, from airlines as diverse as Air Burkina, Carnival and Wizz Air. Muskiet, who has himself been working as a flight attendant for KLM since 1987, explains his obsession over the phone from Amsterdam. Where does your passion for flight attendants&apos; outfits come from? When I was five years old, I flew from New York to Amsterdam. I slept through the whole journey and was very disappointed when we arrived, as I couldn&apos;t remember anything [about the flight] at all. That&apos;s when my obsession with civil aviation was born. I collected everything, from food trays to used boarding passes. It was only later, when I was a teenager, that I got hold of my first uniform, a 70s KLM piece. That was the starting point of my collection.\u00a0 How do you get hold of new pieces? Do you just walk up to colleagues and ask them?\u00a0 Usually, I just send emails to airlines asking for uniforms. I also get offered pieces, as the site has become a sort of advertisement for commercial airlines. And two months ago I was arriving at immigration in Dallas when I saw this American Airlines crew member wearing a scarf I really wanted to have. So I just told her who I was and asked for it. She took off the scarf and gave it to me. I guess it helped that I was wearing a uniform myself.\u00a0 What do you do with all these uniforms? Whenever I get a new piece, I try to take photographs of it and to upload it on to my website as soon as possible. Then I pack up the uniform and store it at home. You must have a pretty big house. I live in a three-bedroom flat in Amsterdam. But, when you step into my apartment, you don&apos;t see any uniforms. I can get very creative in using space, storing the uniforms away in suitcases, boxes and closets, on top of closets or under my bed. But it is getting more crammed.\u00a0 What are the main ways in which uniforms have changed over the decades? In the 40s and 50s the uniforms were mostly military style: tailored jackets, long skirts, dark colours. Back then, all uniforms looked very similar. In the late 60s there was a big change as the idea that &quot;sex sells&quot; took hold. Back then, the idea was that stewardesses should attract passengers. The uniforms got very short, with miniskirts and hotpants. You saw a lot of colours and patterns, red, purple, stripes and dots. From the 90s on, the flight uniforms have turned into business outfits. Today, they look far more professional and, actually, pretty boring. Which is your favourite? I like the uniforms from the late 60s, early 70s sporting psychedelic patterns and lots of colours. And most of them came with hats. I love hats; they are like the icing on the cake. They make a uniform complete.\u00a0 Will you ever stop collecting? All collectors share the same feeling: they always want to have more of something. It doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s stamps, coins or uniforms. I don&apos;t care if people think I am crazy. Whenever I obtain a new piece, it simply makes me happy.\u00a0", "sentences": ["Muskiet, who has himself been working as a flight attendant for KLM since 1987, explains his obsession over the phone from Amsterdam.", "When I was five years old, I flew from New York to Amsterdam.", "I live in a three-bedroom flat in Amsterdam."], "title": "Flight-attendant uniforms: a perfect history of working women's fashion", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/oct/30/flight-attendant-uniforms-history-womens-fashion", "tags": ["Fashion", "Airline industry", "Mad Men", "Air transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-10-31T16:34:34Z", "article": "What advantages do trams have over buses? Trams are simply so civilised. They run smoothly and predictably along steel rails, with three times the energy-efficiency of buses and without the lurching, swerving and vibration of vehicles that require a\u00a0series of controlled explosions for movement. Visit Nottingham, Croydon or Sheffield to sample their unrivalled delights. Even better, go to Amsterdam, Brussels or Germany, where most large towns and cities run trams along routes where mass, speedy movement is needed. Trams are greener and last much longer than buses, and can cope better with crowds and bad weather. Trams have one disadvantage for the British. With high start-up costs, they need a longish view to be taken to appreciate their advantages. Sadly, our politicians are rarely able to look further ahead than the next election. Terry Cooper, Sheffield Advantages? Their &quot;push-me-pull-you&quot;, non-swerve, fume-free mode of travel; their aesthetically pleasing construction; and the fact that when I was a child, they provided a\u00a0magical form of transport!

You know you can always get back to any street where there are rails. leadballoon Margaret Thatcher was widely quoted as saying that a man who, beyond the age of 26, finds himself travelling on a bus can count himself a failure. So all those over-26 male strivers using buses should jump on a\u00a0tram and become successful. Chris Gent, Nottingham Trams always get through. Once, in Frankfurt, a car parked too near the tram tracks. The driver accelerated and took the side off the car. The noise was frightful, but we never felt a thing. Ken Baldry, London N1  Did cowboys have American accents? Seeing as they were only recently settled in America from Britain, should Hollywood think more Colin\u00a0Firth than Clint Eastwood? I agree with Geoff Clifton (N&amp;Q,\u00a025 October): many westerns reflect the immigrant mix. Michael Mann&apos;s The Last of the Mohicans featured some interesting accents, especially that of Daniel Day-Lewis \u2013 emergent American? Kevin Costner&apos;s Open Range (a great film) has Michael Gambon straight from\u00a0Belfast. dravot Since a lot of cowboy films feature railways and are set in the mid-19th century at the earliest, what reason is there to think they were recent immigrants from England? They may have been Scottish, or more likely Irish. I would think it very unlikely that someone with an accent like Colin Firth&apos;s would be working as a cowboy. What&apos;s more interesting is that all the Hollywood cowboys are depicted as white, which was definitely not the case \u2013 many were black or Latino. richardanthony  Why do so many female Christian names end in &quot;a&quot;? In Latin the ending indicating a female is &quot;a&quot; \u2013 it was &quot;e&quot; in Greek. Many of our girls&apos; names come from Latin sources, or latinised versions of names from other languages. Although Roman males had a first name personal to them, females did not; they had the female equivalent of their father&apos;s family name. For example Gaius Julius Caesar had one daughter, Julia, but if he&apos;d had a dozen they would all have been Julia. As this is obviously a source of some confusion, numbers, nicknames or shortened forms were often used in the family to differentiate a girl from her sisters. Hence &quot;Prima&quot; etc. The official name would have been used in documentation, so we often do not know exactly how many daughters there were, or exactly which one was involved in any particular incident. Roman girls were only of significance in relation to whose daughter they were. Alexandria Not just Christian. Many Muslim female first names also end in &quot;a&quot;.

Booksellers are back out on Columbus Avenue, the movie theaters are open, the nail salons are full. The New York City Marathon \u2013 which passes through the Upper East Side and Central Park \u2013 will go ahead on Sunday, because nobody has anything better to do than clean up millions of paper cups trampled underfoot by runners blocking the avenues. But a few miles south, it&apos;s another city. There is no power anywhere in lower Manhattan, cellphone service is spotty, and many buildings have no water or heat. Residents who&apos;d planned for a short blackout, as happened here for one day in 2003, are facing days without power \u2013 and, as a consequence, without food or supplies. Downtowners are streaming north to buy groceries or charge their phones, or else to work remotely when they can&apos;t do so from home. Outside the Ace Hotel, a few blocks north of the electricity cutoff point, people were huddled together at a station to recharge their devices, and in one coffee shop on Amsterdam Avenue no fewer than 20 Wi-Fi refugees were hunched over laptops. The gyms have been overloaded with downtowners taking showers, which has generated a strange economic divide: the tony Equinox chain sent out an email telling clients that no guests were allowed, while the less pricy New York Sports Club has swung open its doors to one and all. Herman Luk, who works at a startup tech company, was coming up Sixth Avenue from his apartment in Tribeca, where he lives on an upper floor of a high-rise.  &quot;Water ran out yesterday morning,&quot; he explained, &quot;and the emergency lights in the building died out. It&apos;s pitch black in the stairwell.&quot; He and his girlfriend made only moderate preparations; they filled their bathtub with water and bought a few supplies, but after last year&apos;s overhyped Hurricane Irene they decided not to stockpile. Now, Luk was coming uptown to buy provisions \u2013 everything near him is closed. &quot;Uptown it&apos;s like it never happened, just like Irene,&quot; he said. &quot;Downtown, with no power and no water, you feel like you&apos;re living in the south in hurricane season \u2013 except you live 14 floors up.&quot; Luk needed more than an hour to get uptown, first on a free bus and then on foot, and no wonder: the roads are choked with Bangkok-style traffic. On an average weekday the New York subway system logs 5.3m rides; push all of those onto the streets and this is what you get. Yellow cabs are permitted to take multiple fares, as they have during previous transit strikes, and thousands of interloping gypsy cabs are in the mix as well. But it takes ages to get anywhere, and even a bike won&apos;t help much; the avenues of midtown are glorified parking lots, and matters aren&apos;t helped by the closure of 57th Street, home to the half-destroyed crane alongside the most expensive residential project in town. You might as well walk. At the Museum of Modern Art, a queue of stir-crazy tourists snaked all the way through the lobby, out the front door, and halfway down 53rd Street. But the New Museum, down on the Bowery, is shut, while in Chelsea, home to the city&apos;s leading commercial art galleries, power remains out and flooding has destroyed untold millions of dollars in paintings and sculpture. The Metropolitan Opera is going back on tonight; Off-Broadway is dark for the foreseeable future. The big department stores along 5th Avenue are open, and doing a fair bit of business; the boutiques of Soho and Nolita are shuttered. The cutoff for electricity, at least on the west side, is 25th Street. At Seventh Avenue the stationery store on the north side of 25th is open for business, while the grocery store on the south side is shuttered, its inventory rotting away. Some of the busiest sites in the city are the delis and bodegas one or two blocks north of the power divide; hundreds and hundreds of downtowners stop at the first open business they see for coffee and the New York&apos;s traditional express breakfast of scrambled eggs on a bagel. The contrast is even starker when the sun goes down. &quot;Last night, it looks like an apocalypse happened,&quot; said Stephanie Lee, an attorney who lives in Stuyvesant Town, the massive residential development on the East River. The buildings there took on three feet of water; there&apos;s now no electricity, no heat, no internet access, and only intermittent water. She was headed back to her seventh-floor apartment to fetch clothes and food before moving in with a friend uptown. She doesn&apos;t feel unsafe, but the neighborhood is being abandoned; at night, without street lamps, &quot;it feels like Gotham in Batman.&quot; Tuesday night in the West Village, on the corner of Bleecker Street and 8th Avenue, a small grocery store that remained open had no power for its freezers or refrigerators, but was doing brisk flashlight-aided business in tuna fish and potato chips. The cashier didn&apos;t even flinch when a woman asked if she could pay with a credit card. A few bars were open, all lit by candles and with the predictable chalkboard outside advertising plenty of booze, but they weren&apos;t doing much business. The one activity that everyone seems to engage in: taking Instagram photos of felled trees. Not far from anyone&apos;s mind is that other disaster, 11 years ago, that cut downtown off from the rest of New York. But while the confusion and camaraderie of lower Manhattan reminds us of the days after 9/11, the mood remains reassuringly pleasant, at least so far.  &quot;There&apos;s a generator in Stuy Town, and one guy last night begged to use my phone charger,&quot; Lee said. &quot;I thought he had an emergency call to make. Turned out he&apos;d met some girl the night before and he wanted to see if she&apos;d texted him.&quot; But whether the mood downtown remains as light this evening, and in the unknown powerless days to come, is far less certain.", "sentences": ["Outside the Ace Hotel, a few blocks north of the electricity cutoff point, people were huddled together at a station to recharge their devices, and in one coffee shop on Amsterdam Avenue no fewer than 20 Wi-Fi refugees were hunched over laptops."], "title": "A tale of two New Yorks: Sandy splits city but its residents band together", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/31/new-york-hurricane-sandy", "tags": ["New York", "Hurricane Sandy", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "US news", "World news", "US weather"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-01T22:00:02Z", "article": "Spoiler alert: this blog is for those watching Hunted on BBC1. Please do not read on if you haven&apos;t seen episode five.  Julia Raeside&apos;s episode four blog This week&apos;s episode of Hunted was brought to you by the letters O, M and G. And by the number what? I can see what has happened here. Mr Spotnitz thought that around about episode five he&apos;d better start giving us some answers to the many and complex questions set up in preceding weeks, before we all run into the street in our nighties, grabbing random strangers and asking them: &quot;Are you the mole?&quot; But instead of putting some pieces of the jigsaw into place, he has kicked the table away, sent the pieces flying and is now doing a morris dance on them, singing Saturday Night by Whigfield. Where are we up to? In summary: the building blew up, Aiden was knocked out, then he was OK. Sam wasn&apos;t murdered by the needle killer but just put to sleep. She was OK . Blank Face Man told Sam her life was in danger. She said: &quot;No shit.&quot; (I did laugh.) Deacon finally asked Aiden: &quot;Are you the mole?&quot; Yes! Then Aiden shot a window and escaped through it. Sam tried to kill Aiden. He told her: &quot;I found your hidden room, I know everything.&quot; FYI, Sam, anyone walking past could have found your hidden room because you left the curtains open. Deacon went to see his priest and purged his guilt about those two innocent people that Byzantium got murdered. Sam recognised the distinctive spires from her flashbacks and realised Hourglass was something to do with her childhood abduction and the murder of her mum. George got dart-gunned. Aiden and Sam duffed up a load more henchmen. When Sam got back to the Turners&apos;, Stephen asked her where she&apos;d been so she snogged him as a diversion. Well, it worked with Conroy. This week was a mess, frankly, but let&apos;s pick through the debris and see if we can&apos;t find some sense in all the madness. Things we now know (I think) 1. Blank Face Man is actually trying to help Sam, not kill her. He injected her in the eyeball with a sedative so he could have a chat with her. I&apos;m pretty sure you can inject someone in their arm (or their bum if it&apos;s a Carry On film) and put them to sleep that way just as easily. The eyeball skewering is clearly just his signature &quot;thing&quot;, like the Fonz&apos;s &quot;Ayyy&quot; and thumbs-up in Happy Days. 2. Aiden is the mole. 3. Hassan is/was also the mole. I paused this episode so many times and still I struggled to understand how Hassan was also the mole. But there it is. Go to your evidence collage. You may now draw whiskers and a shiny black nose on the photos of both Hassan and Aiden. 4. Aiden&apos;s real name is not Aiden Marsh. We must therefore henceforth refer to him as &quot;Aiden&quot; because we don&apos;t know what he is really called. Nearly everyone in Hunted has more than one identity, which is ruining my colour-coding I can tell you. 5. As pointed out by a commenter last week, Keel has a troublesome addiction to Settlers&apos; Tums, not Refreshers as initially thought. He pops them at an alarming rate. If his acid reflux is that bad, he wants to step things up a gear and hit the Gaviscon. That&apos;ll sort him out. 6.

Hourglass is all to do with a painting in the National Gallery. Actually, I think the painting needs its own section. The painting The Ambassadors by Hans Holbein the Younger (you can totally look it up on Wikipedia) is apparently full of clues about something or other but for the purposes of Hunted, it all points towards the origins of the mysterious Hourglass; an age-old secret organisation made up of the heads of private industry, sort of like Bilderberg but more evil and more ancient. The painting is famous because it&apos;s got a freaky skull painted in anamorphic perspective, like those adverts on rugby pitches. It must be a clue. Stick an anamorphic skull next to your mole pictures and await further instructions.

On receiving the souvenir clogs from Zoe after her visit to Amsterdam, Fowkes niggled: &quot;What about the cheese then?&quot; His fixation with dairy continues. What is his problem? Next time \u2022 Sam visits the doctor she rescued in Tangier in episode one to ask him about Hourglass. &quot;I don&apos;t know anything about this,&quot; he says, looking genuinely confused. &quot;You&apos;re a poor liar, Doctor,&quot; murmurs Sam.

She just harasses the nearest bystander now, demanding to know what they know. \u2022 The Turners junior and senior have some kind of set-to about &quot;respect&quot;.

Italian coaches are encouraged to look at the game from an academic perspective, while Italian footballers are comfortable within multiple formations. Roberto Mancini is one product of this system, although he experienced an unusual start to his coaching career. He was forced to overcome bureaucratic red tape to take charge of Fiorentina nearly 12 years ago \u2013 not only had he acted as Sven-Goran Eriksson&apos;s assistant at Lazio previously that campaign (technically barring him from coaching another side), he also had not yet completed the required coaching courses. He started in a strange position; Fiorentina were a mid-table Serie A club with nothing to play for in the league, but had already qualified for the Coppa Italia final. Mancini&apos;s debut half-season was entirely based around the two-leg final against Parma, so he spent much of the season experimenting. He showcased almost every formation imaginable, primarily to find the best strategy for the final, but partly because he was still learning his craft, and this &quot;free&quot; season served as a fine apprenticeship. Fiorentina&apos;s ultra-defensive display in the final was successful, and that negativity became a key feature of Mancini&apos;s coaching career \u2013 as did domestic cup success at his subsequent three clubs. He also retained that love of tactical switches, like many of his compatriots in the Premier League. Claudio Ranieri, mocked as &quot;the Tinkerman&quot;, and Carlo Ancelotti \u2013 who used four separate first-choice formations within his two years in charge of Chelsea \u2013 were not dissimilar. Neither, however, regularly tried to use a back three. English football has abandoned its obsession with 4-4-2, but a four-man defence reigns supreme. There is unquestionably value in simply trying something different, as Wigan&apos;s switch to a 3-4-3 demonstrated earlier this year, but when big sides switch to that shape, it&apos;s often simply to add extra aerial power at the back \u2013 see Brendan Rodgers&apos;s half-time switch in the Merseyside derby, or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s brief spell with three centre-backs at West Ham United. Mancini&apos;s fondness for a back three, however, is based around attacking intentions. &quot;We changed because Ajax were only playing with one striker,&quot; he said after the defeat in Amsterdam. &quot;When we want to be more offensive, we leave only three defenders back.&quot; Not only is Mancini using the system to be attacking rather than cautious, he takes the opposite view to the likes of Marcelo Bielsa and Pep Guardiola, who have also used the back three for positive purposes. They always favour a spare man at the back, opting for three centre-backs against a front two, or two centre-backs against a lone striker. As his strategy at the World Cup with Chile showed, Bielsa is happy to move back and forth multiple times within one match. It&apos;s in keeping with Rinus Michels&apos;s belief that sides should always have one extra defender than the other side have forwards, and Mancini&apos;s decision to deliberately play three-versus-one at the back when attacking, makes him highly unusual. The City defender Micah Richards&apos;s comments after the Ajax match suggested they were uncomfortable with the system. &quot;We&apos;re used to a straight four and it&apos;s twice we&apos;ve gone to a back five and conceded, but the manager likes it&quot;, he said. Mancini pointed out that Richards had missed a couple of months through injury, and might not have been comfortable with the system. Last week, he went further. &quot;If you don&apos;t understand a system like that, you cannot play for a top team,&quot; he warned. But Richards played in pre-season when City experimented with a back three, and he&apos;s not the only one who appears uncomfortable. In fact, he&apos;s one of the few a back three would suit \u2013 comfortable either as a full-back or a centre-back, theoretically he&apos;s perfect for the right-sided role, but he appears to lack the tactical intelligence of the defenders Mancini worked with in Italy. Mancini has pointed to the Community Shield victory over Chelsea this year, and the near-comeback from 3-0 down against Manchester United back in January&apos;s FA Cup tie, as evidence the back three has worked successfully. But there were mitigating circumstances in both \u2013 one side had had a man sent off, and the shape of the game had changed significantly. If Mancini is to continue with this experiment, some level of fluidity between the systems is wise. Replacing Nigel de Jong with Javi Garc\u00eda means City now have a holding midfielder capable of playing as an extra centre-back \u2013 he can drop into defence and allow the full-backs forward, a la Sergio Busquets, creating a back three without completely reformatting the side. Tactical flexibility is vital as City seek to evolve, and there are many benefits of playing with three defenders. Mancini&apos;s application of the system so far, however, both on paper and on the pitch, has been illogical.", "sentences": ["&quot;We changed because Ajax were only playing with one striker,&quot; he said after the defeat in Amsterdam."], "title": "Roberto Mancini's three at the back for Manchester City lacks logic | Michael Cox", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/nov/02/roberto-mancini-manchester-city", "tags": ["Roberto Mancini", "Manchester City", "Football tactics", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-03T22:04:35Z", "article": "Sir Howard Davies, the man with the job of deciding whether Britain needs a new airport, must be looking with some alarm at the precedents. In 1971, after more than 18 months of work, the Roskill commission recommended that a four-runway airport to serve London be built at Cublington, near Aylesbury. When Michael Noble, then minister for trade, opened the debate on the commission&apos;s findings in the Commons, he said of its authors: &quot;I hope that they may draw some comfort from one of my hon friends who said that the fact that he totally rejected their conclusion did not in any way diminish his admiration for the way in which they had done their work and presented their report.&quot; Their plan, of course, never got off the drawing board. Committing the Conservatives to blocking a third runway at Heathrow was a key plank of David Cameron&apos;s strategy to detoxify the Tory brand and prove that he would put polar bears before sharp-suited businessmen. It was also built on political expediency \u2013 he needed to win Conservative seats in the area. Further, it was a recognition that the building of a third runway would hurt Britain&apos;s then leading role in reducing global carbon emissions But with the economy trapped in a deep malaise Cameron is having a rethink. There is a strong lobby that suggests that UK plc needs extra airport capacity in order to boost future economic prospects. Also, the UK is on track to meet its Kyoto targets, albeit partly because of economic weakness. There is, too, an argument that the tax system may be a better way of reducing the number of unnecessary flights than a ban on building new runways. Flight travel is simply too cheap compared with rail fares \u2013 this is the fault of a tax system that gives an advantage to airlines. George Osborne now firmly believes that if the UK really wants to build an economy that can properly connect with the rest of the world it needs more airport capacity. But the economic case is being driven largely by self-interested parties, not least British Airways, the British Airports Authority and the bodies that represent them. It will be a crucial part of the Davies commission to identify the economic benefits a new airport or runway would deliver. Multinational companies make inward investment decisions on the basis of a whole range of factors, including the skills of the workforce, the strength of the currency and the generosity of state support for industry. Whether the chief executive can jet in direct from Chicago or Shanghai may be a marginal consideration. However, those advocating the development of a hub airport may have a case. If Britain allows its one airport that comes close to being an international hub to become ever more clogged up while Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Madrid and Paris become transit points for Europeans, including enterprising Brits, wanting to get to the fast-growing economies of China, India or Brazil, there is a risk that economic opportunities will be missed, ambitions stunted, jobs lost. However, if any British government is to press the case for extra airport capacity, it needs to make a convincing case for continuing to meet its ambitious carbon emissions target. As this paper said in 2008: &quot;It will require a radical programme of wave and wind turbine construction, nuclear industry expansion and the building of underground vaults to store the carbon dioxide that currently pours from the nation&apos;s coal, oil and gas power plants.&quot; Unfortunately, there is absolutely no evidence that this government&apos;s energy policy is fit for that purpose. Indeed the government&apos;s desire to pursue a dash for gas as a future energy strategy is precisely the wrong direction of travel. Even if the case for a hub airport is established, Heathrow is not the only answer: Heathrow already creates all-but-unbearable noise, pollution and disruption for unlucky residents, and its transport links are groaning. Of those affected by noise pollution in Europe, 30% live in and around Heathrow. Is it really sensible to build more airline capacity in the middle of a major population centre? There is a plausible case that bringing in as many planes as possible \u2013 the proposed estuary airport \u2013 over sea instead of hundreds of thousands of rooftops makes more sense. As importantly, a giant new airport would provide a powerful economic boost for an area where unemployment is high. Although characterised, until now, as a Boris Johnson vanity project, there is support from politicians of all persuasions to the east of London to try and create a hub \u2013 in all senses \u2013 which would address the historical inequalities and poverty to the east of the capital. There is no easy solution. Davies will need wisdom and a good dose of political nous to weigh up the issues \u2013 the financial and environmental costs and any economic advantages. He should use his authority to seize the initiative and insist that the question of airport capacity in the UK be settled sooner rather than later. Otherwise, the likelihood of a repeat of the Roskill commission is all too likely.", "sentences": ["If Britain allows its one airport that comes close to being an international hub to become ever more clogged up while Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Madrid and Paris become transit points for Europeans, including enterprising Brits, wanting to get to the fast-growing economies of China, India or Brazil, there is a risk that economic opportunities will be missed, ambitions stunted, jobs lost."], "title": "Let's not avoid the difficult questions on the future of our airports | Observer editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/03/future-airports-editorial", "tags": ["Heathrow third runway", "Transport", "UK news", "Business", "Airline industry", "Travel and transport", "London", "Air transport", "Environment", "Transport policy", "Heathrow airport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-05T17:25:43Z", "article": "Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s misled investors with excessive ratings for financial products which then lost almost all their value in the financial crisis, according to an Australian court ruling that could open the way for a flood of similar cases. In a strongly worded judgment, Australian federal court judge Justice Jayne Jagot said the credit rating agency and the investment bank ABN Amro had deceived 12 local councils that bought AAA-rated notes created by the bank \u2013 AAA denotes what the agency considers the safest level of investment. The councils were assured the so-called Rembrandt notes bought from Local Government Financial Services (LGFS) in late 2006 had a less than 1% chance of defaulting, but within six months, the councils had lost A$16m (\u00a310.4m), or 90% of the funds they had invested. &quot;S&amp;P&apos;s rating of AAA \u2026 was misleading and deceptive and involved the publication of information or statements false in material particulars and otherwise involved negligent mispresentations to the class of potential investors in Australia,&quot; Jagot said. She added: &quot;ABN Amro was knowingly concerned in S&amp;P&apos;s contraventions of the various statutory provisions proscribing such a misleading and deceptive conduct.&quot; Jagot&apos;s 1,459-page ruling awarded the 12 councils in New South Wales roughly A$30m in total for losses and damages. S&amp;P said in a statement: &quot;We reject any suggestion our opinions were inappropriate and we will appeal the Australian ruling, which relates to a specific rating.&quot; RBS, the British bank which bought ABN Amro in a disastrous takeover in 2007, said in a statement it was &quot;studying this long and complex judgment&quot;. RBS shares were down 1.7 %. The case marks the first time a ratings agency has been brought to book by a court anywhere in the world over the complex financial products widely cited as one of the factors that triggered the crisis. The repackaging of debt into securities with top ratings from S&amp;P and other rating firms contributed to more than \u00a31.25 trillion in losses and writedowns when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. Lawyers said the ruling could set a precedent for future action. &quot;This is a major blow to the ratings agencies, which for years have had the benefit of profiting from the assignment of these ratings without ever being accountable to investors for those opinions,&quot; said lawyer Amanda Banton, who represented the councils. The claimants welcomed the ruling. General manager at Bathurst Regional Council Dave Sherley told the Sydney Morning Herald that the council was pleased with the outcome and that its staff rely on financial advisers and rating agencies to have the skills they lack. &quot;This judgment will ultimately have the effect of ensuring ratings agencies are accountable and promoting transparency in the ratings process,&quot; he said. The claim, concerning constant proportion debt obligations (CPDOs) sold in 2006, was financed by IMF Australia, a publicly listed company that funds large class-action lawsuits and which is also planning legal action in Amsterdam related to some \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.6bn) in CPDOs sold by ABN Amro and rated by S&amp;P.

This followed last season&apos;s accumulation of 10 points \u2013 the generally accepted standard for progression \u2013 which still placed City third and eliminated them before Christmas in their inaugural Champions League campaign. Yet this term the domestic form of Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Ajax makes City&apos;s return so far, one point, look significantly under par. Real trail Barcelona by eight points in La Liga; Dortmund&apos;s Bundesliga deficit to Bayern Munich is 11; and Ajax lag Twente by 10 in the Eredivisie, with the Dutch champions&apos; only win in their last six outings against City a fortnight ago. If being the only unbeaten team in the Premier League, two points behind Manchester United, is factored in, the 3-1 victory of Frank de Boer&apos;s side over City&apos;s millionaires seems even more disheartening as Ajax roll into the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday evening. After a poor sequence in Europe with the 3-2 defeat in Madrid and 1-1 home draw with Dortmund before the defeat at the Amsterdam Arena, the Mancini mantra of the last campaign \u2013 &quot;we need more experience&quot; \u2013 continues before a match that is must-win to keep any hope alive. &quot;For us it is the second year we have been in the Champions League,&quot; he said. &quot;We need more experience as a team, not so much individual players because they do have experience. But we need to be lucky because it is difficult when you are in the worst group all the time. I said after the 0-0 at West Ham on Saturday if we said: &apos;We are ready to win the Champions League&apos;, it is not [true].&quot; The counter argument to that of collective inexperience is that, armed with knowledge gained from last year&apos;s failure and having the pick of a band of stellar &quot;individual players&quot; that he accepts possess the know-how, Mancini was offered a fresh five-year deal precisely because he is the man City believed could transform their European fortunes this time. So far his personal Champions League career statistics do not support that view when set alongside prominent peers. Pep Guardiola&apos;s win percentage is 60%, his loss rate 10%; Sir Alex Ferguson is next with 55% to 19%; Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s is 55%, 20%; Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s reads 53%, 23%; and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s is 46% against 29%. In these two defining categories of managerial ability Mancini&apos;s numbers rank bottom: he has a 45% victory rate and a 31% defeat count. As the Italian accepts, his squad bulges with vastly seasoned internationals whose 785 total caps is more than United, Chelsea or Arsenal, the other Champions League contenders from these shores, though City&apos;s combined 434 appearances in the competition is more than only the 314 of Wenger&apos;s squad. Mancini&apos;s go-to performers also include a World Cup and twice European Championship winner (the currently injured David Silva) and four Champions League victors (Maicon, Carlos Tevez, Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Mario Balotelli), who have also all won domestic titles overseas). Gareth Barry agrees with the manager that individually they cannot hide behind inexperience. The midfielder said: &quot;As players we can&apos;t use that as an excuse. This group of players have been together for two years and maybe you can look into that a bit. We&apos;re certainly not using that as the main excuse. &quot;My reason is that we have not performed to the best of our abilities and have been found out. It is a step up, you&apos;re playing top teams every week in the Champions League. We need to adapt to that a little bit better.&quot; Barry was frank when describing how a healthy togetherness manifests itself at the club. On Monday Tour\u00e9 told a French newspaper that there can be arguments among players but that was normal and his midfield partner said: &quot;If you go in the dressing room, we are not high-fiving every five minutes or having long conversations. The team spirit is being professional and doing a job on the pitch together and that is what we feel we have got. We try to do that, perform and run for each other, the fans and the manager. That is team spirit. &quot;Ever since this club went through the change [of ownership], it has had that thrown at it: egos, people can&apos;t get on and whatever. But inside the dressing room we are close. We will put that right and make people quiet with performances.&quot; If experience is what you unwantedly get handed by not having it when you need it, then Mancini is intent that City learn from theirs. He added: &quot;We need to improve our team and we need to learn from our mistakes.&quot; The problem could be that with Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, City&apos;s new chief executive and director of football respectively, forming an ex-Barcelona axis at the club, the big whisper is that Guardiola could join his erstwhile colleagues to form a formidable Spanish triangle of power if Mancini does not deliver. &quot;I think the owners are upset [by the performances],&quot; the manager said. &quot;I don&apos;t feel they are happy.

An Ajax side containing Frank Rijkaard, Clarence Seedorf, Jari Litmanen and Patrick Kluivert (on the bench) had just won the European Cup. How times change. City now have more dough than a workaholic baker, while the Amsterdam club haven&apos;t gone beyond the group stages in the Champions League since 2005-06 and can consider themselves to be on something of an upswing having actually made the tournament proper for the last couple of seasons. They&apos;re clubs who seem poles apart these days in outlook and expectation, which is why it was such a shock a fortnight ago when Frank de Boer&apos;s side piled the pressure on Roberto Mancini with a 3-1 win over the English champions. Yet Ajax are in pretty miserable shape in the Eredivisie. They&apos;ve not won in four attempts and lost 2-0 at home to Vitesse at the weekend. They are fifth, but trail the leaders, FC Twente, by 10 points, the same gap that separates them from 16th-place PEC Zwolle. And while domestically they&apos;ve been, like Hard Fi&apos;s third single, hard to beat (yes, a seven-year-old musical reference counts as bleeding edge to me), in Europe they&apos;ve been, like Hard Fi&apos;s ninth single, good for nothing (yes I had to look that up). That is until City rocked up at the Amsterdam Arena and watched as the home side partied like it was 1995.  Still, the Dutch giants are supposed to be the whipping boys in Group D and City are huge odds-on favourites tonight. Anything other than a win and Mancini&apos;s side can pretty much kiss goodbye to the Champions League for another season and Mancini himself can start thinking about polishing up the CV that had seven or eight clubs clamouring over his services towards the end of last season.  The teams are in: Man City: Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Nastasic, Clichy, Javi Garcia, Barry, Nasri, Toure, Aguero, Tevez. Subs: Pantilimon, Maicon, Dzeko, Sinclair, Kolarov, Balotelli, Meppen-Walter. Ajax: Vermeer, Van Rhijn, Alderweireld, Moisander, Blind, De Jong, Poulsen, Schone, Boerrigter, Eriksen, Babel. Subs: Cillessen, Enoh, Sana, Veltman, Denswil, Dijks, Fischer. Referee: Peter Rasmussen (Denmark)  So Ajax look like they&apos;ve stuck with the 4-3-3 that served them so well in Amsterdam while Mancini looks to have opted for solidity and a three-man midfield wall of Garcia, Barry and Tour\u00e9.  7.25pm: Just over quarter of an hour til kick-off. How do I know? Because I&apos;ve just seen this. That and the clocks, obviously. We have clocks.  Here&apos;s Bobby Manc: &quot;They [the players] don&apos;t need to have my passion. They need to play football like they can.&quot;  ADVERTS, ADVERTS, ADVERTS \u2026 Gamble, get new car insurance, get a new telly (I think \u2026), drink Australian beer, buy a games console \u2026  PEEP! Off we go then. City in sky blue, Ajax in a hideous lime green and deep blue away monstrosity.  1 min: Nasri wriggles some space on the edge of the area but opts not to shoot, then Tour\u00e9 tumbles optimistically in the box.  2 min: Babel charges at Kompany with the ball at his feet, but the City centre-half stays cool and nicks the ball away with little fuss.  3 min: Eriksen unfurls the first shot of the game, but it makes it little more than five yards before it slaps into a City rump.  5 min: Eriksen bounces off Toure in midfield and City flood forward. Aguero shoots. Deflected over. Corner. Claimed by Vermeer.  6 min: &quot;I&apos;ve never liked Wenger (for so many reasons...)&quot; begins Matt Dony, &quot;but I&apos;ve always thought that, had he bought Babel, he would&apos;ve made an absolute star out of him. For all Benitez&apos;s tactical sharpness, he didn&apos;t seem to develop players as well as some other managers. But now it&apos;s probably too late for Babel to really fulfil his potential. Good player, not a great player.&quot;  7 min: Nasri feeds the ball through to Zabaleta. It&apos;s a decent chance for the full-back, but he blazes over.  8 min: Nastasic skews Van Rhijn&apos;s low cross behind for an Ajax corner \u2026  GOAL! Man City 0-1 Ajax (De Jong 9) Holy cow! How did that go in? From City&apos;s point of view it&apos;s softer than Mr Soft&apos;s soft underbelly. The corner isn&apos;t dealt with by the Nastasic, the ball is prodded back across goal and from the tightest of tight angles the Ajax captain lofts the ball over Hart and into the roof of the net.  10 min: City are stung into action and look for an immediate response. Tevez forces a couple of corners. From the second Nastacic squeezes of a shot as the ball drops but it&apos;s straight at Vermeer. The visitors are sitting Mariana Trench-deep, though, inviting pressure.  12 min: &quot;I think that goal is one of those megalolz that the kids are talking about nowadays,&quot; reckons Graeme Neill. To be honest, I wouldn&apos;t know a megalol if it painted itself purple and danced naked on top of a harpsichord, singing &apos;Megalolz are here again.&quot;  13 min: The Etihad is quiet. Very quiet.  15 min: Sch\u00f6ne puts Babel away down the left channel, and the former Liverpool man does well to win a corner \u2026  GOAL! Man City 0-2 Ajax (De Jong 17) \u2026 and it&apos;s another! And it&apos;s De Jong again! This time he gets across the front to meet a near-post inswinger and guides a free header past Joe Hart. Marking? What marking? If Manchester City were a pair of trainers they&apos;d be allowed on a badminton court.  18 min: Tevez sparks panic in the Ajax backline with another low cross. The visitors clear for a corner, then deal with that.  19 min: Two corners for Ajax, two goals. You can have all the rinky-dink passing options up front that you like but set pieces are such a huge part of the game. The Ajax fans are singing Always Look on the Bright Side Of Life.  GOAL! Manchester City 1-2 Ajax (Tour\u00e9 22) And City now at least have a bright side to look on. Again they attack down the right. The cross falls to Tour\u00e9 at the back post and the Ivorian chests down before volleying acrobatically past Verbeer.  23 min: That was something a bit special from Tour\u00e9, but to be honest City have looked dangerous whenever they&apos;ve gone forward.  24 min: Kompany gets to Boerrigter&apos;s cross just ahead of Sch\u00f6ne as Ajax foray forward.  26 min: Nasri crosses. Zabaleta shoots. Deflected. It&apos;s looping in. It&apos;s headed away by Van Rhijn. If I had a \u00a31, the time, and the predilection for compulsive gambling, my \u00a31 would still be on a home win here.  28 min: In the other game in Group D, Dortmund have gone ahead in the Bernab\u00e9u.  30 min: Javi Garc\u00eda lofts in a beautiful sand-wedge of a pass in towards the ever-impressive Zabaleta who has burst through the Ajax backline like an Alien through John Hurt&apos;s stomach. He shows none of the predatory instincts of the aforementioned extra terrestrial, however, and can only guide his header gently into the arms of Vermeer.  32 min: Ajax seem to have weathered the initial storm after Tour\u00e9&apos;s goal. De Jong smites an effort at goal from 30-odd yards, but it trundles well wide.  34 min: Pepe has equalised for Real in Spain, but that&apos;s all irrelevant if the score stays the same in Manchester.  35 min: Barry attempts to thread the ball through for Tour\u00e9 on halfway, but he&apos;s only succeeds in finding a clump of Ajax players. The visitors beginning to dominate the ball now.  37 min: Ajax have done very well to suck the wind from City&apos;s sails and the noise from the terraces. City have barely had a touch in the last five or 10 minutes and there&apos;s barely been a peep from the crowd.  38 min: De Jong sloppily gives the ball away 30 yards from his own goal, but City can&apos;t quite plough through.  39 min: Tevez goes down on the edge of the box, but the referee makes that wavey-scoopy-get-up-get-up motion with his arms and we play on.  41 min: It&apos;s been a bad night for Ag\u00fcero, Barry and Nasri thus far. Nastasic is still to convince too.  43 min: Grumblegrumblegrumble go the terraces as City work the ball back to Hart rather than go forward.  44 min: With seconds until the break, City force a corner \u2026  45 min: \u2026\u00a0Vermeer flaps, but gets enough on it.  PEEP! And that&apos;s the break. A pretty even half in the end.  Balotelli is out on the Etihad pitch, warming up. Looks like he&apos;ll be on after the break. Wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see Nasri give way.  And indeed Balotelli is coming on but it&apos;s Javi Garcia who is to be replaced  PEEP! Ajax get the second half underway.  46 min: DOOF! Blind goes hammering into Nasri and gets a booking for his trouble. It looked nasty but replays show the Ajax left-back slipped on his way in to the challenge, to be fair.  47 min: Vermeer gathers the resultant free-kick.  48 min: Ag\u00fcero skitters through looking dangerous on the edge of the box, but his footing goes at the worst possible moment and Ajax clear.  49 min: Tour\u00e9 comes steamrollering out of defence like a runaway tank. His pass finds Ag\u00fcero, whose legs are found by the feet of Alderweireld. No free-kick given, but then Tevez tumbles on the left edge of the box and City do have their free-kick. It&apos;s a dangerous one \u2026  50 min: Barry zips it in at knee height to Nastasic, but his first-time effort soars over the bar.  51 min: At the other end, Babel hoofs a cross hopelessly out of play for a goal kick.  52 min: Tevez goes down again on the edge of the D. Free-kick. This is a real chance \u2026  53 min: \u2026 Tour\u00e9 pings it into the top of the wall, Clichy prods the rebound back into Aguero, who tucks it past the onrushing Vermeer. Celebrations are cut short by the linesman&apos;s flag. The Argentine was a yard offside.  55 min: Tour\u00e9 thunders into the box. Ajax don&apos;t even bother trying to stop him, but his pass into the six-yard box is cleared away. It&apos;s one-way traffic at the moment.  56 min: De Jong is given space enough for a four-bed detached house and a sizeable garage around 30 yards from goal. His effort is sweetly struck, but Joe Hart claws the ball away.  58 min: Vermeer does well to smother a cross as Aguero closes in.  60 min: Vermeer goes all Jackson Pollock as he rushes out for a through ball. Aguero nicks it past him and gets to the byline. As he turns, looking up to see who&apos;ll get a simple tap in in the middle, his feet give way again and the chance goes begging.  61 min: Ajax have offered almost nothing this half. They&apos;ve not been allowed to get their pass, pass, pass, pass, passpasspasspasspasspass stuff going.  63 min: Ajax force a corner \u2026  64 min: \u2026\u00a0Ajax, having taken two corners and scored two goals, decide to take it short. I mean really. It&apos;s cleared. Obviously.  65 min: Tour\u00e9 \u2026 Tevez \u2026 Barry \u2026 that bloke in the parka in the third row, some 20 yards wide of goal.  66 min: Mancini unleashes Dzeko. Off comes Tevez.  67 min: Ajax do get time for some pass, pass, pass, pass, passpasspasspasspasspass which ends up with Van Rhijn on the right, who flashes a low ball across the six-yard box. Zabaleta has to put behind, but this time City, courtesy of Joe Hart&apos;s Fist of Fury, deal with the corner.  69 min: Eriksen, so elegant he should be playing in a ball gown, helps Ajax work the ball through midfield once more. And they win a dangerous free-kick \u2026  70 min: \u2026 De Jong spanks it goalwards and Hart makes a flying save to his left.  72 min: City have gone flatter than the mill pond in Flat Stanley&apos;s back garden.  GOAL! Manchester City 2-2 Ajax (Aguero 74) Which, of course, is a notoriously lively mill pond, with lots of waves and whirlpools and the like. Hart boots long, Balotelli heads on, and Aguero skitters on to the ball and prods beyond Vermeer.  76 min: Moisander times a challenge perfectly to deny Zabaleta as he charges into the box. Ajax are facing a tricky 15 minutes here.  77 min: City break with frightening speed but Aguero is (wrongly) judged offside from Clichy&apos;s header. That all started when Balotelli battled back to pinch Eriksen&apos;s pocket 30 yards from the City goal.  79 min: Nasri dinks in a free-kick, Balotelli sends a firm header towards goal and Vermeer sprawls to his left to make a flashy save.  82 min: Ag\u00fcero goes down on the left edge of the area under Poulsen&apos;s challenge. Another dangerous free-kick \u2026  83 min: \u2026 Blind does well to get his head on Nasri&apos;s centre.  84 min: Van Rhijn sends in another cross so vicious it has it&apos;s own theme music and finishing move. It&apos;s a corner for Ajax, but City have sorted themselves out and again clear.  85 min: Poulsen goes into the referee&apos;s Big Book of Very Bad Boys for a tug on Balotelli.  86 min: Kolarov replaces Barry and his first act is to win a corner.  87 min: Eventually Kolarov gets the chance to slide in a cross from the edge of the box, but Dzeko gets caught in two minds and can only sidefoot wide.  88 min: GOA \u2026 NO OFFSIDE! Dzeko prods through to Kolarov, and his centre is turned in by Aguero. The flag goes up, though. It&apos;s incredibly tight.  90 min: Three added minutes and in the first substitute Viktor Fischer should have done better than to poke into the side-netting.  90+2 min: Eriksen gets space and stings Hart&apos;s palms with a long-range effort. Corner \u2026  90+3 min: \u2026 which drops out to Fischer, who wangs his shot out for a throw-in.  90+4 min: City get a free-kick on halfway. Just about time to take it \u2026  90+5 min: \u2026 Hart pumps it in. It drops to Balotelli! Surely that&apos;s a penalty? The referee has blown \u2026 for full-time!  Well, well, well. It was Van Rhijn with a handful of Balotelli&apos;s shirt. City players surrounded the ref. Mancini came striding out from the technical area to have his say. Zabaleta (I think) was caught by the mics saying a BAD WORD. And when the dust settled it is still full-time and City are still staring down the barrel of Thursday nights on Channel Five.  It&apos;s impossible to say really whether the referee decided it wasn&apos;t a penalty and then blew for full-time or whether he blew up before making any decision.  Here&apos;s Vincent Kompany: &quot;Should we have had a penalty? You guys will be able to judge better than me.&quot;  Right, that&apos;s it from me. Thanks for your company and emails.

Ever since the draw for the Champions League groups was made he has insisted that Group D was a proper group, unlike other groups in which &quot;other teams&quot; play. Other teams, for the uninitiated, is Mourinho&apos;s shorthand for Barcelona. On Tuesday night he called Madrid&apos;s 2-2 draw with the German champions a &quot;great game&quot;, adding: &quot;As I fan I would prefer to see a game like this than the games in some other groups that are like Europa League games.&quot; He has not always been so diplomatic: the word he chose to use a fortnight ago was &quot;joke&quot;. Unlike Group D. The point, of course, is to inject Madrid&apos;s performances with value: it is in Mourinho&apos;s interest to underline the quality of their opponents. But on the evidence of the Champions League so far, he has a point when it comes to Borussia Dortmund. The Germans led Real Madrid until the 89th minute; despite Mesut \u00d6zil&apos;s equaliser, they still lead the group. It was the second time in four games that it had happened: Mario Balotelli&apos;s last-minute penalty and Ozil&apos;s last-minute free-kick have cost the Germans four points. They have been two minutes away from a perfect record: four wins from four. Naturally, that could be read as a failing \u2013 and Dortmund are a side that cede spaces and chances, that commit men forward and spring quickly and in numbers, occasionally leaving themselves exposed \u2013 but the Bundesliga champions are still on eight points. Madrid have seven, Ajax four and City two. They travel to Amsterdam next and then face City in Germany in the last game. They should get through and they should be considered candidates to win the tournament. Mourinho would say so but he was not just saying so. Privately, he has long warned his staff that Dortmund are a genuinely good team that really can win the competition. J\u00fcrgen Klopp&apos;s side, so disappointing in last year&apos;s competition, have been so impressive in this year&apos;s. Roberto Mancini has talked often of the importance of experience; Dortmund appear to have learnt from theirs. Sitting fifth in the league, 11 points off Bayern Munich, their priorities seem clear too. Against Manchester City, they racked up 22 shots, their demolition complete in all but the scoreline. Against Madrid in Germany they were the better side. On Tuesday night, they ended the game on the ropes but, insisted Klopp, &quot;this is Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u&quot; and in the first half, they had deserved their lead. &quot;A victory would have been a fair result,&quot; Klopp said. This time, Mourinho did not agree. Dortmund played Madrid at something approaching their own game: athletic, direct, fast. There is something almost dizzying about the way they play, about the pace and precision of their passing, the verticality of their game. They push men high, particularly wide, pressuring opponents. Their transitions are swift and precise, the full-backs joining in. By the time they took the lead at the Bernab\u00e9u, they had already had two good chances. Both fell to Marcel Schmelzer, the left-back sprinting in behind Sergio Ramos. He had scored in Dortmund \u2013 after a chance created on the other wing. Mourinho bemoaned Dortmund&apos;s goals here as &quot;serious mistakes&quot;. He was right but they were not purely coincidental. Robert Lewandowski was at the heart of both of them. The Pole is a pivot off whom the attack can hinge, drawing defenders towards him and then nodding beyond them, bringing others into the game and bringing them into the game on the run and facing the opposition&apos;s goal. The movement around him is fast and direct, a line of three at the Bernab\u00e9u comprising G\u00f6tze, Reus and Grosskreutz always alert to the spaces created, determined to dash beyond him. It is simple, but it is effective and effectively executed: the ball heads to Lewandowski. As it does so, they too head towards him, continuing their run beyond as he helps it on. Before the game, Mourinho was asked if Dortmund were a team that concerned him in the attacking third. &quot;From three-quarters on \u2026 no,&quot; he said, &quot;from three quarters, no. The whole team worries me.&quot; He added: &quot;This is team that has won two leagues in Germany and that&apos;s not chance. It&apos;s not chance that they are leaders in the group, which is very difficult. It&apos;s a very strong team. Strong, very direct, a very good team. If they go through they are candidates to win the tournament.&quot; Mourinho would say that, of course, but on Tuesday night Alex Ferguson agreed with him.

Voters in both states on Tuesday approved amendments legalising the recreational use of marijuana, historic decisions that reflect growing disenchantment across the US with the decades-old &quot;war on drugs&quot;. A coalition of pot shop dispensaries, civil rights advocates and former law enforcers argued that legalisation would hit drug cartels&apos; profits, boost state tax revenues and reduce the mass incarceration of African Americans and Latinos. &quot;I really think this is the beginning of the end for marijuana prohibition, not only in the US, but in many countries across the world, including the UK,&quot; said Sean McAllister, a former assistant attorney general in Colorado who supported the change. &quot;We didn&apos;t just legalise it \u2013 we created a regulatory system.&quot; Norm Stamper, a former Seattle police chief and member of the group Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, said he was very happy. &quot;After 40 years of the racist, destructive exercise in futility that is the war on drugs, my home state of Washington has now put us on a different path.&quot; Beau Kilmer, co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Centre, called the votes groundbreaking. Once the elections are certified \u2013 which could take up to two months \u2013 personal possession of up to an ounce (28.5 grams) of marijuana will be legal for anyone aged 21 or over in Washington and Colorado. Pot, previously available for medicinal purposes at dispensaries, will be sold and taxed at state-licensed stores. Washington still bans personal cultivation, but Colorado will allow six plants per person. Neither state allows public use. Voters in Oregon rejected legalisation in their state. Social media erupted with jokes and puns, many focusing on Denver&apos;s nickname as the Mile High City and Colorado&apos;s official song, Rocky Mountain High. Questions abound over whether Colorado and Washington will become Amsterdam-style magnets for marijuana tourism, and over how federal authorities will respond. The justice department said federal law making pot illegal remained unchanged. The Obama administration has used federal law to crack down on dispensaries in California and elsewhere, making some Colorado and Washington dispensaries nervous of a backlash. &quot;We don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen \u2013 no clue,&quot; said one Denver store owner, declining to be named. McAllister, the former assistant attorney general, predicted that Obama, secure in a second term, would leave Colorado alone because its regulations were tighter and clearer than the nebulous regulations which left California&apos;s open to abuse. State leaders had opposed the legalisation but promised to respect the vote. &quot;This will be a complicated process, but we intend to follow through,&quot; said the Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper. &quot;That said, federal law still says marijuana is an illegal drug, so don&apos;t break out the Cheetos or Goldfish too quickly.&quot; Mike Coffman, a re-elected Republican congressman, told the Guardian: &quot;I need to see what other states are doing but clearly if there is a sentiment that is moving nationally to legalise marijuana, then I certainly respect the decisions by the states. And I would support the forming of legislation at the federal level. But I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m there yet. I need to study and see what the other states are doing.&quot;", "sentences": ["Questions abound over whether Colorado and Washington will become Amsterdam-style magnets for marijuana tourism, and over how federal authorities will respond."], "title": "Colorado and Washington enjoy their marijuana moment", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/07/colorado-washington-marijuana-moment", "tags": ["Colorado", "Washington state", "Cannabis", "Drugs", "Health", "Society", "Drugs policy", "Politics", "US politics", "US news", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-09T19:35:00Z", "article": "No sooner had the voters of Colorado and Washington passed measures to legalise marijuana than the predictions began: visions \u2013 both overexcited and apocalyptic \u2013 of busloads of stoned tourists turning the states into Rocky mountain or Pacific north-west versions of Amsterdam. However such speculation may be premature. There are a few more hurdles before legally buying and selling marijuana in the US can become reality. But in the interests of answering the age-old question &quot;Where can I legally buy a joint?&quot;, here&apos;s a summary of what the votes really mean for the law in Colorado and Washington. Colorado Colorado amendment 64 passed on 6 November 2012, by 53.3% to 46.7%. The amendment allows &quot;personal use and regulation of marijuana&quot; for adults 21 and older. It also has a section which will address the legal cultivation, manufacture and sale of the drug. However, nothing will change until the vote is certified, which is scheduled to happen on 6 December. After that, those 21 and above will be legally allowed to grow up to to six marijuana plants, as long as they are in a locked space. People in the same age bracket will be allowed to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, and to give up to one ounce of the drug as a gift to other people 21 years old or above. Smoking marijuana in public will be specifically banned. The new measures do not just apply to people who live in Colorado \u2013 visitors are subject to the law too. It will be longer before people in Colorado can legally buy and sell marijuana, however. Amendment 64 has a section which will address the legal cultivation, manufacture and sale of cannabis, but the details have to be thrashed out in the state legislature. The new law mandates that the state adopt a regulatory framework for allowing businesses to sell marijuana by July 2013, according to USA Today. This could include provisions for shops selling the drug and the opening of cannabis cafes like those in Amsterdam. But even then, it will be January 2014 before the first state-approved marijuana stores actually open. Before all that, there is the quite real possibility of an injunction by the federal government, overruling amendment 64. Federal laws rule marijuana illegal and in theory have power over state rules. The Drug Enforcement Administration this week reiterated its stance that marijuana is an illegal drug and that possessing, using or selling it is a crime.&quot;The Drug Enforcement Administration&apos;s enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act remains unchanged,&quot; the DEA said in a press statement. &quot;In enacting the controlled substances act, Congress determined that marijuana is a schedule I control[ed] substance. The Department of Justice is reviewing the ballot initiatives and we have no additional comment at this time.&quot; Washington Washington&apos;s initiative measure No 502 passed on 6 November, by 55% to 45%. Like in Colorado, the measure will come into effect on 6 December, but it will also take longer for some parts of the law to be implemented. As of 6 December, it will be legal for people over 21 in Washington to possess up to an ounce of marijuana. Unlike in Colorado, however, people will not be allowed to grow their own marijuana plants, unless they are medically authorised to do so. Like in Colorado there will be a significant wait before provisions are put in place allowing the legal sale and cultivation of marijuana. Initiative measure 502 had an &quot;implentation date&quot; of 1 December 2013, by which date licensing and taxation portions of the initiative should be set out. Only after that will individuals 21 or older be able to apply for a license to grow and sell marijuana. It will cost $250 to apply for the license, according to the measure, and an extra $1,000 a year to keep it. &quot;Licensed marijuana retailers could not sell any products other than marijuana and items used to store or use marijuana,&quot; 502 states. The laws on smoking marijuana are already very relaxed in parts of Washington. Seattle&apos;s city attorney has a policy &quot;of not filing charges for simple marijuana possession&quot;, according to the Seattle Post Intelligencer, while people attending the three day Hempfest in the city are generally allowed to smoke cannabis. That said, the new laws outlined in Washington&apos;s measure 502, like Colorado&apos;s amendment 64, could be overruled at the federal level.", "sentences": ["No sooner had the voters of Colorado and Washington passed measures to legalise marijuana than the predictions began: visions \u2013 both overexcited and apocalyptic \u2013 of busloads of stoned tourists turning the states into Rocky mountain or Pacific north-west versions of Amsterdam.", "This could include provisions for shops selling the drug and the opening of cannabis cafes like those in Amsterdam."], "title": "Colorado and Washington legalise marijuana: what it really means", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/09/colorado-washington-legalise-marijuana", "tags": ["US domestic policy", "US elections 2012", "Cannabis", "Colorado", "Washington state", "Obama administration", "World news", "US news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-09T22:30:01Z", "article": "Ron Vlaar knows Robin van Persie well. He plays alongside him for Holland, has the utmost respect for his ability and remembers listening to the Manchester United striker telling him at Euro 2012 why the Premier League was the place to be. There is not, however, the slightest chance that the Aston Villa captain will take a leaf out of Andr\u00e9 Santos&apos;s book by doing everything he can to get the shirt off his friend&apos;s back during United&apos;s visit on Saturday. &quot;Never, never,&quot; Vlaar says, when asked whether he would ever consider swapping shirts at half-time (video), in the same way Santos did with Van Persie last Saturday, when the Arsenal defender behaved more like an autograph hunter than an opponent hell-bent on winning. &quot;I don&apos;t think of that before I go into a game. It&apos;s not about changing your shirt with another player. I want the points, that&apos;s the most important thing.&quot; The 27-year-old hardly comes across as a serial shirt collector. This is a man who has Mike Tyson&apos;s face emblazoned across the front of his hoodie and is nicknamed &quot;Concrete Ron&quot;. That moniker was bestowed on Vlaar at Feyenoord, where he spent seven years before joining Villa in the summer. He loved his time at the Dutch club but there were also some tough periods, in particular the back-to-back seasons lost to injury after he damaged the same cruciate ligament in his knee on two separate occasions. &quot;The first time it happened was on 16 September 2007 and that season was gone,&quot; Vlaar says. &quot;And the second time was 17 September 2008, so one year and\u00a0one day later. Again the same knee and again the season was gone. But I&apos;m a fighter, so I always think of the positive side.&quot; Did he ever fear his career could be over? &quot;I was worried,&quot; Vlaar says. &quot;Not the first time because it happens often with players and you see they come back. But the second time I was only thinking: &apos;OK, become fit and then you&apos;ll see.&apos; The recovery was very good and at the start of the [following season] I came back to the club. And after two years of injury, I played 32 of the 34 games, so that was really amazing.&quot; These days Vlaar is very much into the psychological side of football. At Feyenoord he worked with a personal trainer who opened his eyes to &quot;mind setting&quot;, which involves visualising how games will pan out beforehand. &quot;I really believe in mind-setting because you can already play the games a little bit in your mind before you play, recognising situations that you have to deal with, and that worked great for me last season.&quot; A graduate of the youth system at AZ Alkmaar, Vlaar started playing as a centre-half in his early teenage years and grew up idolising the Dutchman who was at the heart of the Manchester United defence at the time. &quot;Jaap Stam was really amazing. He was an example,&quot; he says. &quot;He was strong. And the way he stands on the field, his stature, I think he frightens [opponents]. He was a real winner. Everything for the win, a leader.&quot; Paul Lambert, the Villa manager, quickly identified Vlaar as someone who can inspire others. Vlaar has worn the captain&apos;s armband since Swansea&apos;s visit in September, a game that was watched by his parents, who try to get over from Holland to see all the home matches, and also his grandmothers, who are aged 86 and 90. &quot;I loved that,&quot; Vlaar says. &quot;To come to England was very big for them.&quot; The trip was good timing because Swansea is one of only two league games Villa have won this season. Although last Saturday&apos;s 1-0 victory at Sunderland was encouraging, Villa remain 17th and face United, Manchester City and Arsenal in their next three matches. Not that Vlaar is downbeat. &quot;I know, especially from last year, what we did with Feyenoord... I believe that we can do that again [at Villa]. I&apos;m not saying that we can come second. But we can build and make a team that can believe.&quot; Like most Dutch footballers, Vlaar&apos;s English is excellent. He has quickly settled into life here and last month took in one of his favourite sports, when he watched Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan and Jimmy White play in Bedworth as part of the Snooker Legends Tour. There was also a pleasant surprise when Jan Verhaas, the Dutch referee, arranged for Vlaar to partner O&apos;Sullivan in a doubles match against White during the interval. &quot;I don&apos;t think that many people can say they&apos;ve done that,&quot; Vlaar says. &quot;I potted red, pink, red, blue, so I was pretty happy with that.&quot; Vlaar admits that he was more nervous with a cue in his hand than he will be when he lines up against Van Persie, who will be on the same team as him a few days later when Holland take on Germany in a friendly in Amsterdam. Villa have a dreadful home record against United, and Van Persie, is bang in form. But Vlaar gives the impression that reputations mean about as much to him as opposition shirts. &quot;We all know who we&apos;re playing against,&quot; he says. &quot;But I&apos;m not afraid of anyone.&quot; Ron Vlaar supports the Acorns Children&apos;s Hospices &quot;Now is the Time&quot; campaign, which aims to raise funding for 25,000 days of care for local life-limited children by the charity&apos;s 25th anniversary in December 2013.

With its hippies and peeling shopfronts draped in windchimes, the town became a haven away from the camping and less-sheltered beaches at Broken Head, where my family and I set up tents and stoves most Christmases after driving for a whole day north from suburban our home in suburban Canberra. Byron and Broken are a seven-minute drive apart on a windy, rainforest-lined coast road. Byron, then was a dishevelled main street with a Mexican takeaway, a few stellar restaurants, beautiful girls wearing liberatingly oversized dresses and men with dreadlocks. Sometimes, Byron Bay was a room, usually at the Wollongbar Motel (+61 2 6685 8200, wollongbar.com, singles from \u00a390, doubles \u00a397). The Wollongbar is still unpretentious and convenient and Byron can still feel dreamy, but these days it&apos;s also jampacked. When I moved here I paid Manhattan prices to live five minutes out of the centre and got stuck in traffic driving in to town to buy groceries that were more expensive than in New York. So, I started exploring my options, and finding neighbouring townships such as Newrybar, Coopers Shoot and Bangalow. I was awakened to the seaside havens and hinterland destinations that the bubble of Byron had blindsided me from. When people now ask me where they should stay on their Byron holiday, I suggest the Bangalow Hotel (+ 61 2 6687\u00a01314, bangalowhotel.com.au, singles from \u00a347, doubles \u00a360), the Eltham Hotel (+61 2 6629 1217, elthampub.com.au, rooms from \u00a364), and The Channon Butterfactory Tavern (+61 2 6688\u00a06522, thechannon.com.au, singles from \u00a347, doubles \u00a364, family \u00a380). In other words, not Byron and not even on the beach. These are local hangouts, classic pubs in tiny towns amid hilly farmland that morphs into rainforest and waterfall territory. There&apos;s so much fantasy in this landscape. Here, solid hippies, wealthy retirees and chilled out dudes coexist.     Little Amsterdam \u2013 hippy-ish Nimbin. Photograph: Getty Images    I tell them to visit Nimbin, of course, \u2013 the infamous commune-esque town that tourists still travel to on rainbow-coloured buses seeking Amsterdam-style delights. Just beyond Nimbin at Lillian Rock, the Blue Knob Markets every Saturday are real-deal farmers&apos; markets with homemade bread, chocolate, pasta and vegetables. Before Nimbin, the Channon touts itself as the craft capital \u2013 it&apos;s an elegant tiny township with a busy market every second Saturday. It is also the turning point into Nightcap national park, which is full of magical walking tracks, waterfalls and grand escarpments, and so many native birds and protected creatures such as the endangered Fleay&apos;s barred frog. There&apos;s the 4\u00bd-mile rainforest walk looping around Minyon Falls, which tumbles 97m down cliffs of solidified lava. The walk is rocky and scrambled in parts but breathtaking, especially the icy swim at the foot of the falls. There&apos;s also a challenging overnight walk from Mount Nardi, inviting stargazing from bush camps along the way. The pinnacle of this post-volcanic playground is Mount Warning, 1,156m of volcanic remnants that reigns solid and stoic over the entire Northern Rivers region. If you do no other walks, tackle the 5\u00bd-mile round-trip climb through eucalypts and rainforest to the mountain&apos;s peak. Aim for a morning hike: the peak gives 360-degree views across lava-formed land and apparently gets the state&apos;s first sunrays. It&apos;s not an easy walk, especially the final ascent, though there are chains for assistance. Back at base, stop at Mavis&apos;s Kitchen (64 Mt Warning Road, Uki, +61 2 6679\u00a05664, maviseskitchen.com.au) for slow-cooked, organic fare \u2013 Bangalow pork with apple sauce and crackling, snapper-and-vegetable pie or just a Devonshire tea. Mavis&apos;s also has rustic cabins and a full country house (from \u00a3150 per night per couple).     Byron Bay Photograph: Peter Harrison/Getty Images    I&apos;m not saying skip Byron Bay \u2013 the snorkelling and eating there will die hard. When I\u00a0visit, I\u00a0always have a morning swim and grab a cane\u00a0sugar-sweetened coffee at Cane Bar (Cavanbah Arcade shop\u00a04, 4\u00a0Jonson Street, canebar.com.au) and take yoga classes at Byron yoga centre. And if staying in the hinterland isn&apos;t the dream, base yourself in Lennox Head, Byron&apos;s cooler cousin. I&apos;d stay at the Lennox Head B&amp;B with its mosaic staircases and plunge pool (+61 2 6687\u00a04493, no website, units from \u00a398). (There&apos;s also a perfectly fine caravan park on the edge of the tea tree Lake Ainsworth) Lennox is smaller than Byron with one main street and a fraction of the frills. It is an old-school surfie town, and though house prices have risen in past decades Lennox is still home to working-class families as well as the Sydneysiders who&apos;ve escaped here to set up hair salons and cafes and live the simple lifestyle that Byron now has a hard time delivering. Early morning beach walks are great in Lennox Head, especially for dog lovers. There&apos;s also a captivating dawn surf culture. Stop at Blackboard Cafe (50 Pacific Parade, blackboard.net.au) for coffee and the blueberry and coconut bread, spread with lime and honey butter. Dine later at Quattro (90-92 Ballina Street, +61 2 6687\u00a06950, quattro-restaurant.com) on the main square. It&apos;s a busy, delicious Italian restaurant, the al mare pasta is zesty with thyme-cream sauce and prawns. From Lennox, visit Brunswick Heads, which is the epitome of a charming seaside town. It&apos;s a 25-minute drive north up the highway. Spend a day swimming in Brunswick&apos;s protected ocean lagoon or surf in front of the 50s brick surf club. It has plenty of restaurants and twilight markets. Just across the highway is Mullumbimby, another two-street town with vintage stores and grainy, organic nibbles \u2013 the pizza at Milk and Honey might be the area&apos;s best. From Mullumbimby, drive inland to Upper Wilsons Creek for a day of fruit platters, body wraps and speciality massages at Botanica Day Spa (+61 2 6684\u00a00120, brdayspa.com.au). All this can be done from Lennox, as can a 20-mile walk along the coast ending (or beginning) in Ballina, which winds around rock cliffs and through corridors of nourished native plants. Along the walk is my favourite view in the world. My heart always flutters as I\u00a0round the cliff towards Sharpe&apos;s Beach and I mount a grassy rise above a rocky drop: the view shoots out across the Pacific and all the way up and around the coastline that leads to Byron, the lush, somewhat messy green of the protected coast contrasting with the stark blue ocean on sunny days and romantically misty grey any other time. Such soulfulness isn&apos;t absent in Byron but you&apos;ll fight to find a spot to chill. Once I&apos;d lived there, I realised the casual town of my dreams is now not that unlike a small Manhattan, a self-sufficient bubble, energetic, expensive, where one can avoid the world at large. That&apos;s nice for a morning surf or a night out, but I&apos;m relieved to report that there&apos;s a whole world just a drive away. \u2022 Emma Pearse&apos;s first book, Sophie: Dog Overboard, is based in Mackay, Queensland.

The reception is bright and neat and, at first glance, non-descript. Community event notices on the walls, orchids on a desk, a visitor on a sofa filling in a form. Copies of National Geographic adorn the coffee table but the eye is drawn to colourful hardbacks: The Big Book of Buds: Marijuana Varieties from the World&apos;s Great Seed Breeders, volumes I to III. Beside them, another catchy title: The Cannabible. Ean Seeb, the co-owner, offers a warm smile and handshake. &quot;Other places put up Bob Marley posters and palm trees, but if you didn&apos;t know us, this could be a doctor&apos;s office.&quot; We pass a hallway display case filled with elaborate bongs, waterpipes and glass pipes and enter a sanctum where two employees in black T-shirts serve customers weed from glass jars labelled with names such as Bio-Diesel, Ultimate &apos;91 ChemDawg and DJ Short&apos;s Flo. They chat about Barack Obama&apos;s victory, check ID, swipe credit cards. It&apos;s all rather routine, even banal. That is the point. Denver Relief, one of 500 medicinal marijuana dispensaries in Colorado, offers itself as testament to the fact you can openly, legally sell the drug without the sky falling or drugged zombies rampaging. Which is just as well, because on the same day that Obama won another term, Colorado and Washington voted to legalise marijuana for recreational use, landmark decisions with profound implications for the decades-old, US-led &quot;war on drugs&quot;. Seeb, 37, an entrepreneur and civic activist, did not doubt its significance. &quot;It&apos;s the beginning of the end for marijuana prohibition.&quot; Quite a prediction, given successive presidents since Richard Nixon invested billions in criminalising the drug, jailing thousands for possession and pressuring the rest of the world to follow suit. The war on drugs seemed as engraved into the political landscape as Mount Rushmore. Except now, at least in relation to marijuana, it seems to be crumbling. Seeb&apos;s confidence is shared in the US by a broad range of politicians, analysts, activists and former law enforcers who argue legalisation will generate tax revenue, hit drug cartel profits and curb the disproportionate jailing of Latinos and African Americans. Leaders across Latin America, once obedient to White House drug policy, were already pushing for reform, led by Guatemala&apos;s president, Otto P\u00e9rez Molina. A senior aide to Mexico&apos;s president-elect, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, said Colorado and Washington had &quot;changed the rules of the game&quot; and this would be discussed with Obama and congressional leaders this month. A study by the Mexican Competitiveness Institute said legalising cannabis in Colorado, Washington and Oregon could cut cartel profits by up to 30%. &quot;I really think this is the beginning of the end for marijuana prohibition, not only in the US, but across the world,&quot; said Sean McAllister, a former assistant attorney general in Colorado and member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition. &quot;We didn&apos;t just legalise it \u2013 we created a regulatory system.&quot; Just as Colorado and other states pre-empted the federal government&apos;s abandonment of alcohol prohibition in 1933, the same may happen with pot, albeit slowly and unevenly. Colorado&apos;s successful experiment with marijuana dispensaries \u2013 pot shops for people with medical certificates \u2013 emboldened voters to back amendment 64, which allows anyone aged over 21 to buy small amounts. It was the same dynamic in Washington. &quot;I hope we continue to show the US and the rest of the world what we can do as a regulated economic model,&quot; said Elliott Klug, 35, owner of the Pink House chain, which has six dispensaries in Colorado. &quot;We are not here to promote a gangster model, we want to be good corporate citizens.&quot; Klug&apos;s talk of branding, quality, market share and cost effectiveness was a world apart from movie stoners Cheech and Chong. Other dispensary owners struck the same tone. &quot;It&apos;s a tough business, very competitive,&quot; said Toni Fox, owner of 3D, her 10,000 sq ft cultivation centre and store in Denver. &quot;There are more dispensaries than [standalone] Starbucks.&quot; Even after legalisation for medicinal purposes in 2000, marijuana was considered seedy in Colorado, not quite the hysteria of 1936 propaganda film Reefer Madness but still a far cry from hippie counter-culture tolerance. &quot;You&apos;d walk into places that felt like your buddy&apos;s college basement. Very shady,&quot; recalled Kayvan Khalatbari, who co-owns Denver Relief. But as the drug war escalated, and the front line shifted from Colombia to Mexico, where more than 60,000 have died since 2006, and with ethnic minorities packing US jails for minor drug offences, opinions shifted. Centrist thinktanks, such as the Brookings Institution, advocated legalising cannabis [see footnote]. More than a dozen US states did so for medicinal use. &quot;The medicinal marijuana industry in Colorado was a model for how legalisation can work \u2013 it works pretty darn well,&quot; said Betty Aldworth, of the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol. The state, home to liberal bastions such as Denver and Boulder, and with a tradition of growing fine weed, organised a 2006 ballot to legalise pot for recreational use. The shoestring Yes campaign lost 41% to 59% but gathered more support, money and organisation for another try this year. The eclectic coalition included the American Civil Liberties Union, maverick Republicans, students and advocacy groups, such as the Drugs Policy Alliance, Just Say Now and Yes on 64. With $2m they hit airwaves casting the debate in terms of civil rights, jobs, fiscal gain (claiming $60m in savings and revenue) and state autonomy. Senior Democrats and Republicans opposed the amendment but prioritised the presidential and congressional races. A Florida-based group, Save Our Society From Drugs, helped fund the No campaign, but it raised only about $700,000. The energy of the Yes campaign was palpable a week before the vote. Driving across state, you saw pro-legalisation posters in towns and cities. Radio call-ins fizzed with passionate argument. &quot;Our phone lines were just jammed,&quot; said David Sirota, a 630 KHOW host. University students packed an auditorium in Boulder to hear Gary Johnson, a former New Mexico governor who ran for president on the Libertarian ticket, argue for legalisation. &quot;Denver has the opportunity to change the world. Denver gets it,&quot; he said to cheers. Speaking to the Observer afterwards, Johnson said banning pot was madness, though he no longer smoked it himself. &quot;I gave it up when I started becoming an athlete.&quot; Soon after the polls closed last Tuesday, hundreds of campaigners packed Casselman&apos;s Bar in Denver to await the result. Giddy at the prospect of making history, they exploded when a giant screen gave them victory, 53% to 47%. &quot;We won! We won!&quot; A similar scene unfolded in Seattle, where the legalisation side won by 55% to 45%. State officials, including senators, members of congress and mayors, said they would respect the decisions, but no one knows quite what will happen next. Under federal law, pot remains illegal. The Obama administration cracked down on dispensaries in California, where chaotic regulation has led to abuses. Activists say \u2013 hope \u2013 the feds will leave Colorado and Washington alone because their regulation is tighter and a second-term president should be looser. Many of the campaigners who rented apartments in Denver are expecting to move on to California, Oregon and other battlegrounds, part of a strategy to focus on states before moving on to federal level. Colorado&apos;s first recreational use shops are expected to open within a year but wags are already joking about Denver&apos;s nickname, Mile High City, and state anthem Rocky Mountain High. Opponents see nothing funny about the prospect of Amsterdam-style &quot;drug tourists&quot;. The continued ban on public consumption means no coffee shops but cannabis-friendly hotels and perhaps private clubs may sprout. Johnson was not worrying. &quot;Won&apos;t it be great when everyone gets on a plane to Denver at the weekend to chill out?&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 12 November 2012.

The marketing people say &quot;it is undoubtedly the most exciting new chapter in the story of London and quite possibly the last time the capital will see the creation of such a completely new district&quot;. With 20,000 homes over 195 hectares, it makes the much-discussed Olympic Legacy development look puny. This is &quot;Nine Elms on the South Bank&quot;, to give the official brand, a stretch along the Thames from Vauxhall to Battersea power station. It is currently made up of low sheds for such things as a DHL&apos;s depot, the Royal Mail&apos;s South London Mail Centre, and New Covent Garden market of fruit, flowers and vegetables, plus a few forlorn riverside apartment blocks from the 1980s, patiently waiting for a vibrant urban quarter to take shape around them. It is close to the centre of London yet somehow has remained untouched by large-scale development. It has not required an entire Olympic Games to unlock it but the planned arrival of the American Embassy in 2017. This move may have been dictated by the desire to find the area of central London most resembling the Afghan wilderness so that an ultra-secure, democratically styled, diplomatic Bagram could be built exactly as the State Department wanted, but it is still a remarkable thing that it should come here. With the possibility of other embassies following suit, it really could have a powerful effect on the area, and make it more than an extra-large dollop of residential units. So we are talking about something grand here: let&apos;s say at the same level as Sir John Nash&apos;s series of urban set-pieces running from St James&apos;s Park up Regent Street to Regent&apos;s Park. Right next door to Nine Elms is one of the nation&apos;s leading examples of how not to develop large urban sites. Routinely described as &quot;London&apos;s greatest opportunity&quot; by the likes of Michael Heseltine, and subjected to successive competitions and &quot;visions&quot; from the early 1980s onwards, it is a collection of spasmodic gestures which demand your attention and conflict with their neighbours in equal measure. Collectively it is like the plates offered by doomed, over-eager contestants in Masterchef: chilli and kiwi fruit and vanilla and gherkin and lemongrass. Watching the new Bond film Skyfall, I disturbed the cinema with an involuntary whoop when one of these works, the MI6 headquarters, was blown up. Yet this flesh-coloured ziggurat is a masterpiece of refinement compared with what came after it. There is the notorious St George Wharf, twice voted worst building in the world by the Architects&apos; Journal&apos;s polls of architects. There is a transport interchange, a flightless metallic bird designed by a wannabe Hadid or Libeskind. And, bringing the dismal history bang up to date, the shaft of the repulsive Vauxhall Tower, which John Prescott pushed through against the considered judgment of his planning inspector, and of his own civil servants, is now taking shape. There are intentions to do better with Nine Elms. The developers Ballymore, one of the larger landowners in the area, commissioned a masterplan for the whole zone from Terry Farrell (who, despite the fact that he was the architect of the MI6 building, has always been strong on urban planning.) There are proposals for a linear park parallel to the river, running the length of the site, and hopes of building a pedestrian and/or cycling bridge across the Thames so that the site is better connected, which is a palpably good idea. Ballymore&apos;s proposed apartment blocks are more sober and considered, and better planned, than the monsters of Vauxhall Cross, including such simple good ideas as decent-sized balconies. Other landowners in the area have commissioned notable architects, including the practices of Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, to design their buildings. According to Roger Black, Ballymore&apos;s creative director, the park will be &quot;absolutely fundamental to the social and cultural outcome&quot; of the development. Designed by the landscape architects Camlins, it will be an &quot;important community link for everyone&quot;, and he promises that it will be run in such a way that it will not just be a privileged enclave for the residents of Ballymore&apos;s flats. &quot;It will also be beautiful,&quot; he says, and compares it to the High Line, the phenomenally successful park on a former elevated railway in Manhattan. I am losing count of the number of putative High Lines now floating about in the minds of planners and developers, and the cynic in me thinks that part of a linear park&apos;s appeal is that it does not take up too much valuable space. But never mind: with the river and the large Battersea Park nearby, new expanses of open space are not what is most needed around here. The park, as a way of encouraging people to walk, of unifying the area, and of joining the blocks of flats to the open spaces (for both security and recreation) around the cuboid Embassy, is welcome. It is considerable progress on the havoc of Vauxhall Cross, and the grossly oversized proposals drawn up by Battersea Power Station&apos;s former owners, the unlamented Treasury Holdings. But the new Nine Elms is not yet up there with the works of Nash. It is a sketch of what a good piece of city might be, generic in its detail, and the available images do not yet show the very specific qualities \u2013 such as the combination of industrial relics and wild planting \u2013 that make the High Line work. It also suffers from the fact that Nine Elms as a whole belongs to several large landowners who, beyond fitting into the outlines of the masterplan, do not show much interest in getting their buildings to speak to each other. On one plot aggressively crystalline blocks by Rogers Stirk Harbour are going up, their diamond shapes having nothing in particular to do with anything around them. On another Foster and Partners have designed a series of curving, stepped, blobby things, of the kind usually designed to take advantage of views of the Med or the Gulf, but are here facing each other like rows of daleks. Again, it shows little interest in anything around it. The engagement of eminent architects will probably lead to crisper details and some sort of stylishness but it is not leading to much increase in urban intelligence. Places in cities are made by their horizontal surfaces, such as the linear park, and by the vertical surfaces of the different buildings around them. It is a basic principle of design that they jointly work together, yet, at the boundaries of different developments, adjoining projects act as if the other is not there. Things get worse at the Vauxhall Cross end of Nine Elms, where the Vauxhall Tower has been taken as a precedent for a new clutch of towers, by Foster and Partners, KPF and Rolfe Judd, each with an arrogant, lazy indifference to their cumulative effect. Boris Johnson&apos;s &quot;greatest transformational story&quot; deserves better than this. What is lacking is a concept of the whole that is more than a diagram of development sites and reasonably good planning ideas, and the means by which individual projects can contribute to it rather than detract from it. Other cities \u2013 Berlin, Amsterdam, New York \u2013 manage this better but in Britain public bodies lack the confidence to lead. It is left to developers to act as surrogate mayors and city planners. Some, like Ballymore, might do it better than others, like Treasury Holdings, but in the end it&apos;s not their job.", "sentences": ["Other cities \u2013 Berlin, Amsterdam, New York \u2013 manage this better but in Britain public bodies lack the confidence to lead."], "title": "Utopia-on-Thames?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/11/nine-elms-south-bank-regeneration", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "London", "Planning policy", "Boris Johnson"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-11T07:00:00Z", "article": "When I finished studying my economics master&apos;s at the University of Amsterdam I didn&apos;t know what I wanted to do. My passion for my subject never left me, but I ended up getting a job at the university coordinating internships for medical students. Then in the last year before I went into teaching I worked as a foreign exchange officer for the Erasmus programme \u2013 working with groups of young people getting them enthusiastic about going abroad. There are a lot of teachers in my family. My mother, who was a German teacher, told me at the time of finishing my master&apos;s, that teaching was terribly hard work for very little pay. So I didn&apos;t even think of teaching at that time. But I started really enjoying the sides of my job that involved working with young people. When we decided to leave Amsterdam for Zutphen in eastern Holland three years ago, I decided to change my career to teaching. I actually started teaching without any training after writing unsolicited letters to schools in the east of Holland. I got a job teaching economics to 14 to 17 year olds in Arnhem. It is not so unusual to get a job teaching economics without a teaching degree in Holland because schools can&apos;t get enough teachers with the subject knowledge otherwise. Many people who study economics want to earn more money than teaching offers. The school wanted me as soon as possible, so for the first six weeks of my new job I had to commute from Amsterdam. I was late for my very first class. The students were waiting for me and I rushed in all out of breath with absolutely no experience of teaching. I knew my subject but I wasn&apos;t trained as a teacher I didn&apos;t know anything about classroom management, so some of the lessons were a bit of a disaster. After the first year I got another job teaching economics at a Waldorf/Steiner school called Vrijeschool Zutphen VO, in Zutphen. It&apos;s a modern Steiner school that prepares children for normal exams. There is also a focus on more holistic subjects to prepare students for their whole future from drawing, to carpentry, to work through play. The school gives a lot of attention to individual students which is part of the reason I really love to work there. I also started studying for my teaching degree at the university of Nijmegen when I started working at this school. As I already had my master&apos;s, I didn&apos;t have to study the economics part of the teaching degree but it takes two years part time which I have been doing while teaching almost full time. After one year I had major setback with the course as my youngest child at the time was diagnosed with kidney cancer. He was only two years old and at the same time my wife was pregnant. It was such a terrible time. You can imagine it&apos;s the worst thing that can happen. Now my son has only one kidney but he&apos;s almost recovered. After my son&apos;s chemotherapy I was chronically tired, a tiredness that you just can&apos;t imagine. I had to miss loads of classes and in the end the doctor advised me that the only way to get over it was not to teach the last two classes of the day. This worked and now I&apos;m so happy to be back to normal. My school has been really understanding throughout but my studying was badly affected so I&apos;ve still got to finish my teaching degree which I have to do by September 2013 and I&apos;ll do it! A lot of the students studying teaching on the part time route have dropped out. In fact I&apos;m the only teacher of economics left on my course. There&apos;s a bit of a time bomb with teachers here in the Netherlands as many teachers are poised to retire and not enough have been trained so I do think there&apos;s some work to do here in retaining trainees. Teaching is the career for me, I&apos;ve realised that. At first when I taught at the other school before I had any training, I didn&apos;t have a lot of tips for classroom management, so sometimes it was really awful. I had no experience and had no training. I had a coach to help me but it was difficult to find time to meet. But I discovered I liked to transfer knowledge and work with young people. The whole subject of economics is really about global awareness and the choices people make. I like to use current affairs and the news in all my lessons. I almost always start a lesson with a news item to inspire my students and to get a response from them, to make it current. Being globally aware is really important especially in the Netherlands as we are such a small country. We are living on exports to other countries and trade. Our pupils almost all learn to speak English fluently and many learn German as well. There&apos;s a huge interest in the global appeal of the internet. I&apos;ve got English friends who are teachers who tell me that our pupils seem far more globally aware than theirs in the UK. I think we probably are more internationally aware than other countries. We are not patriots as the US are. When we say we are proud of our country, I think most of us are more proud of what we have achieved, for example the freedom we have or our welfare system rather than just patriotic. Our students feel like they live in Europe, they are Europeans and are concerned about Europe and the whole world. From what I&apos;ve read, especially on the Guardian Teacher Network, the concerns you have in the UK are similar to ours in the Netherlands. We too have problems with our politicians. Our politicians also think they know a lot about education and make decisions that teachers don&apos;t agree with. We too have pay issues \u2013 for example all Netherlands teachers are on a pay freeze along with all other public sector workers. My students are interested in the world and being aware of what goes on is tremendously important to them. They are eager to learn because of current affairs which I use as a hook to interest them. So for example in work about the credit crunch my students will know a lot about Greece and what&apos;s happening there, my challenge is to get over to them more theoretical knowledge about the economic cycle. All students in the Netherlands learn economics in year 9. They are 14 to 15 years old in the middle of puberty and so looking at society and themselves. Then they can choose to drop economics in year 10 so it&apos;s not compulsory like maths or literacy, but a lot of students choose economics because it&apos;s a subject you can do so much with. Teaching is definitely the career for me. People say the best thing is the holidays, and we don&apos;t get quite as much as teachers do in the UK. But of course most teachers work a lot in their holidays. The best thing has to be the children. I love making my students enthusiastic about the subject and helping them learn skills that they&apos;ll need later on. Of course these are teenagers so making them enthusiastic, well that&apos;s the real challenge. I love to transfer knowledge about my subject, my first love, economics. I had a 12-year break from my subject and while of course I kept informed about the news during that time, it&apos;s great to be back. I&apos;ve really chosen to do this and I do think it&apos;s quite a good idea to come into teaching later rather than straight from university.

Sculpture by artist Marco Cianfanelli. Photograph: Doug McKinlay    Fifty years ago this year, a 45-year-old Nelson Mandela, leader of the armed wing of the of the anti-apartheid African National Congress (ANC), was arrested while posing as a chauffeur. His car was stopped by armed police along a quiet section of the R103, two miles outside the small town of Howick in Kwazulu-Natal Province \u2013 about five hours south-east of Johannesburg. Having successfully avoided capture for 17 months, Mandela was returning from a visit with the ANC President Chief Albert Luthuli when he was finally caught. It was the beginning of 27 years of imprisonment in the maximum-security prison on the infamous Robben Island. That once obscure patch of tarmac has now become home to the Nelson Mandela Capture Site (thecapturesite.co.za). Set among rolling hills and farmland, the free attraction consists of a small museum detailing the beginnings of apartheid and the ANC&apos;s and Mandela&apos;s struggle against it. The most moving aspect is the sculpture Release by artist Marco Cianfanelli. It is made up of 50 steel column constructions \u2013 each between 6.5 and 9.5 metres tall \u2013 set into the landscape. A brick pathway brings visitors towards the sculpture where, at a distance of 35 metres, a portrait of Nelson Mandela, pictured, looking west, is created from the columns. It is an understated monument to the country&apos;s struggle for freedom, very moving in its simplicity. There are other museums in South Africa where visitors can learn about the struggle against apartheid. Johannesburg has two: Liliesleaf Farm (liliesleaf.co.za), used secretly by ANC activists in the 1960s and the place where many prominent ANC leaders were arrested, leading to the Rivonia Trial; and the Apartheid Museum, (apartheidmuseum.org), a comprehensive and emotional journey through the history of the system \u2013 and its impact.Doug McKinlay What&apos;s new?

Members of the public accounts committee described a director from Amazon as being &quot;deliberately evasive&quot; and displaying &quot;outrageous&quot; ignorance after he failed to say how much profit is generated in Britain or who owns the online retailer&apos;s Luxembourg-based holding company. A senior figure from Starbucks, which employs more than 7,000 staff in more than 800 outlets in the UK, was told he was not believed when he claimed the coffee chain did not make profits in Britain. An executive from Google admitted it operates in Ireland because of a low corporation tax rate there of 12.5% and was later accused by the committee chair, Margaret Hodge, of &quot;immoral&quot; behaviour. Hodge told the executives that UK taxpayers are increasingly frustrated by the use of tax havens and creative accounting by large firms trading in Britain. &quot;People want to know why companies which benefit from an infrastructure paid for by them and are paying people low wages who receive taxpayer-funded tax credits from the exchequer are not paying their fair share,&quot; she said. Amazon avoids UK taxes by reporting European sales through a Luxembourg-based unit, MPs alleged. This structure allowed it to pay a rate of less than 12% on foreign profits last year \u2013 less than half the average corporate income tax rate in its major markets. Andrew Cecil, Amazon&apos;s director of public policy, was accused of being &quot;totally evasive&quot; after failing to explain who owned the company, and was unable to detail the income made by the Britain arm of his business. Hodge claimed the director was not a &quot;serious person&quot; to appear before the committee and vowed to order another senior executive to appear before it to fill in the blanks in his evidence. She asked why customers buying books through a UK website are billed from the UK and goods are delivered from UK centres but taxes are paid in Luxembourg. Cecil said some taxes are paid in Britain. Amazon.co.uk paid \u00a31.8m in corporation tax on more than a \u00a3200m turnover for 2011. He added that the firm was being investigated by the tax authorities in France. Starbucks paid no corporation or income tax in the UK in the past three years, it emerged last month. The world&apos;s biggest coffee chain paid \u00a38.6m in total UK tax over 13 years during which it recorded sales of \u00a33.1bn. Troy Alstead, its global chief financial officer, faced repeated claims from MPs that it engaged in aggressive tax avoidance in the UK as he tried to explain its corporate affairs. He declined to give details publicly of a favourable rate granted it in the Netherlands on a proportion of profits transferred there in the form of an intellectual property &quot;royalty&quot; on UK shops. Dutch authorities wanted that to remain confidential, he claimed, prompting allegations it was a &quot;sweetheart&quot; deal that bosses wanted to keep under wraps. Tory MP Stephen Barclay said a reduction in the level of that royalty from 6% of sales to 4.7% after talks with HM Revenue &amp; Customs appeared to be merely a &quot;cosmetic&quot; move. It resulted in an \u00a38m increase in corporation tax, Alstead said. He was unable to give any breakdown of how either figure was calculated. Alstead claimed that globally Starbucks remains &quot;an extremely high tax payer&quot; but had failed to generate substantial UK profits. &quot;Respectfully I can assure you there is no tax avoidance here,&quot; he said. Asked to say what rate the firm paid in Amsterdam, where it had a roasting operation, he said tax authorities there had asked for it not to be disclosed publicly. Google&apos;s filings show it had \u00a32.5bn of UK sales last year, but despite having a group-wide profit margin of 33%, its main UK unit had a tax charge of \u00a33.4m in 2011. The company avoids UK tax by channelling non-US sales via Ireland, an arrangement that allowed it to pay taxes at a rate of 3.2% on non-US profits. It also diverts some of its profits through Bermuda. Matt Brittin, the head of its northern Europe operation, said that Google operates in Ireland and Bermuda because they offer attractive tax rates. &quot;Like any company you play by the rules [and] manage costs efficiently to offer fair value to shareholders,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re not accusing you of being illegal, we are accusing you of being immoral,&quot; replied Hodge. All three companies have been asked to supply further information to the committee.

In 2004 the football writer Uli Hesse-Lichtenberger wrote: &quot;As far as Germans are concerned, you can sum up the situation in two statements. First, Holland-Germany is one of the most heated rivalries in Europe. Secondly, the mentally unstable party in this explosive relationship is the Dutch. They not only started this rivalry, they have carried it to a point where it is obsessive, almost psychotic.&quot; Times are changing. When Germany arrive at the Amsterdam Arena on Wednesday night they will be booed and hissed but then pantomime villainry will give way to more pressing concerns. Defeat when overwhelming favourites to beat Italy during the semi-finals of Euro 2012 was a painful enough rejoinder but getting a mannschafting from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and friends after leading 4-0 at home to Sweden was a violent attack on everything German football once stood for: mental toughness, obdurate defence, never giving a centimetre when a millimetre will suffice. Der Spiegel described that performance last month as &quot;60 minutes heaven, 30 minutes hell&quot; but the inquest has burned a lot longer. Joachim L\u00f6w has guided his side to two semi-finals and a final in three tournaments but the questions are becoming more pointed now. Why are the basics of defending so loosely applied? Do the attacking three \u2013 possibly Lukas Poldolski, Thomas M\u00fcller and Mario G\u00f6tze against the Dutch \u2013 track back enough? And what is the point of creating beautiful pictures if they can be ripped apart so easily? Germany run the risk of being international football&apos;s answer to Arsenal: enthralling neutrals but winning nothing. It has now been 16 years since they won an international trophy. How long before Baddiel and Skinner start working on their German compound verbs? There have been suggestions that L\u00f6w will try to recalibrate the balance between attack and defence against Holland. His side certainly have something to prove although, given injuries and illnesses, they may lack the toolbox to do it. Many of the marquee names \u2013 Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, Miroslav Klose, Mesut Ozil, Marcel Schmelzer and Mario G\u00f3mez, who scored both goals in Germany&apos;s 2-1 win over the Netherlands in Euro 2012 \u2013 are missing. Still, that provides opportunities for others. Schalke&apos;s Roman Neust\u00e4dter could make his debut \u2013 adding steel to central midfield \u2013 although a partnership with Sami Khedira may sacrifice too much flair for protecting the back four. Neust\u00e4dter&apos;s club team-mates Lewis Holtby and Julian Draxler are also likely to feature. And with no recognised forward, the Borussia Dortmund midfielder Marco Reus \u2013 who has scored three goals in five games \u2013 is expected to lead the line. &quot;We want to finish the year on a good note, and win over our fans with a good performance,&quot; L\u00f6w says. He will need to. Certainly the new Dutch coach, Louis van Gaal, is not afraid to twist the screw, telling the German tabloids: &quot;It&apos;s important for a coach to win titles. He&apos;s won little.&quot; The Dutch have questions of their own to answer, however. It is now a decade this week since they last beat Germany, with goals from Patrick Kluivert, Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink and Ruud van Nistelrooy and they flopped at the Euros when third favourites. Watching them attempt to seek a more harmonious path under Van Gaal will be interesting, as will seeing them line up without the injured Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie on Wednesday night. Still, they have plenty of players who can shatter wobbly defensive foundations. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, one of six in the Dutch squad who play in Germany, has 34 goals in 59 internationals and is chasing down Patrick Kluivert&apos;s all-time tally of 40 goals in 79 games. And Arjen Robben insists he has the bit between his teeth too. &quot;It&apos;s still an important and very special game,&quot; he told Bild. &quot;However, the hatred and aggression from before is no longer there. The relationship between Netherlands and Germany is pretty good these days. I think this has something to do with Louis van Gaal&apos;s time at Bayern Munich but players like Mark van Bommel, Rafael van der Vaart and myself have made a good impression in Germany, too.&quot; That much is true. The heat has died down in recent years \u2013 although a pre-Christmas friendly between these teams is not yet the moment for stollen, gl\u00fchwein and merry times. This matters.

Colin Matthews, the chief executive of Heathrow (formerly BAA), said the nature of &quot;hub&quot; airports was poorly understood, and highlighted new research that claimed lack of hub capacity could deprive the UK of trade opportunities totalling \u00a314bn a year. Inaction would see foreign competitors race ahead, with Schiphol, Amsterdam, in particular already taking business. Matthews said: &quot;Heathrow can last without a third runway, but it is a progressive relative decline.&quot; He admitted that &quot;if you ask three economists, you get three different answers&quot;, but said research Heathrow commissioned from Frontier Economics suggested the potential costs to the wider UK economy as well as aviation could total \u00a314bn a year, although it warned the figures should be treated with caution. New Chinese destinations such as Chengdu could provide a third of that uplift. Campaigners Hacan (Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise) pointed to a bilateral agreement between China and the UK restricting flights, and questioned the need for an expanded &quot;hub&quot; airport. Spokesman John Stewart said: &quot;We can find no hard evidence that the London economy will lose out if Heathrow does not expand as a hub.&quot; The reports mark Heathrow&apos;s first public foray into the capacity debate since the formal launch of the Sir Howard Davies commission earlier this month. It is not due to report until June 2015, after the next general election, although Davies has promised that his interim findings in late 2013 will significantly narrow down the options for potential airport expansion. Heathrow&apos;s major opponent now seems to be the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who had a first meeting with Davies on Wednesday and offered to work closely with the commission, although he previously made clear he would not be bound by its findings.", "sentences": ["Inaction would see foreign competitors race ahead, with Schiphol, Amsterdam, in particular already taking business."], "title": "Heathrow must be expanded or replaced, airport chief announces", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/15/heathrow-issues-hub-airport-decision-warning", "tags": ["Heathrow third runway", "Travel and transport", "Environment", "Airline industry", "Business", "London", "UK news", "Air transport", "World news", "Heathrow", "Travel", "Heathrow airport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-15T13:29:36Z", "article": "The best thing about the peculiar English distrust of Zlatan Ibrahimovic&apos;s talents is the riposte that arrived in the Friends Arena, a selection of goals that should be shown to football apprentices from anywhere in the world to demonstrate how variety and imagination is worth its weight in striking gold. The next best thing, of course, is that he never gave a hoot about what anybody in England thought of him anyhow. At long last, the clumsy stereotype, generated and casually booted about within these shores to jeer that he is not all he is cracked up to be, has been obliterated. Thank Zlatan for that. Admittedly the statistics were not on his side \u2013 in 90 incandescent minutes on Wednesday night he scored as many as he had previously managed against English club and national sides over a period of 1,536 minutes (the equivalent of around 17 full matches). But that particular quirk was a minor blemish on his mostly luminous record. Ibrahimovic always has been an unusual talent. It is easy to assume that his style is largely off-the-cuff, the work of a maverick. But the way that he has harnessed his ability, the methods he has absorbed to try to make the best of his gifts, suggests that beneath the showman is a man who has learned to also appreciate efficiency. A sporting education that took place in Sweden, the Netherlands and Italy has added that particular string to his bow. His observation during the week that Steven Gerrard might have benefitted from some overseas experiences, some broadening of horizons, was a fascinating one because of what it reflected about himself. In some ways, his virtuosity against England summed up how he is the product of the many different football influences that have made him. Zlatan proudly wears the yellow shirt of Sweden, the country of his birth, but so much of his style is classically Balkan. The audacity, the craving for artistry and crafted skill, the machismo, the singularity, the passionate and independent spirit that has made his coaches both love him and tear their hair out \u2013 these are characteristics that are not traditionally Scandinavian. Ibrahimovic&apos;s father is from Bosnia, and his mother from Croatia. They both emigrated, and met in Sweden, but they evidently passed on to their boy plenty of the characteristics from home. One of Ibrahimovic&apos;s boyhood teams, FBK Balkan from the Malmo suburbs, connects the old Yugoslav flag and a Swedish flag in its crest, which sums him up well. Incidentally, he recalls once playing for them, coming on at half time when his team were losing 4-0. He scored eight goals in the second half. Having been an apprentice with Malmo, the next stage of Ibrahimovic&apos;s footballing evolution took him to Ajax, one of the great finishing schools. Technique, technique, technique. The environment encouraged the 20-year-old to integrate his qualities with his team-mates, to play within the overall pattern of the gameplan. It was in Amsterdam that his eye-catching performances began to make him a globally recognised name, and his next move to Italy would add further refinement. Playing in Serie A, Ibrahimovic enhanced his movement, his ability to use wit to get the better of wily defenders. Massimiliano Allegri, the Milan coach, explained how Ibracadabra needs thoughtful management to keep him at just the right point between content and fired up: &quot;With him, you have to use both the stick and the carrot. Ibra is a strong personality and needs to be relaxed at times, while in other occasions he has to be stimulated, otherwise he falls asleep.&quot; Carlo Ancelotti is guiding him at the moment with Paris Saint-Germain, and it is to Ibrahimovic&apos;s credit that he is not swanning around the French capital enjoying his gigantic wages and treating the move as a glorified payday. He is in scorching form for PSG and is likely to lead them to the title (in what would be, astonishingly, his ninth championship win in 10 seasons with six different clubs). If you wish to pick holes in Ibrahimovic&apos;s career, the season he spent at the Camp Nou is the closest to a disappointment. It was an experiment that didn&apos;t spark, and he resembled a square peg in a round hole more often than not. He still ended up with a Spanish championship medal and a contribution of 16 goals from 29 games. It was around this time that he needed a pick-me-up, both for club and country. It is sometimes forgotten than Ibrahimovic&apos;s love affair with the Swedish national team has not been a constant. In October 2009, he retired from the international game for the best part of a year, abstaining because he felt tired of it all. Sweden&apos;s failure to qualify for the World Cup in 2010 left him so disillusioned he wanted time out. &quot;After that last match when we didn&apos;t qualify for the World Cup, I felt like I&apos;d lost my breath,&quot; he explained. &quot;I had no motivation.&quot; Erik Hamr\u00e9n coaxed him out of his funk, promising unswerving love and support, and the captaincy, if he would think about returning to the fold. The only condition was that Ibrahimovic had to be happy to be there. No moaning allowed. &quot;It&apos;s no use people turning up for work like Eeyore the donkey,&quot; the coach said. &quot;Sure, Eeyore is a good friend. But he&apos;s always sad and walks around with his head down. I would much rather my players were like Winnie the Pooh, who is bright and cheerful and believes anything is possible. It&apos;s all about attitude \u2013 if you play for Sweden, you play with your heart and with a smile on your face.&quot; Ibrahimovic was all that, and more, in his wondershow against England. As Hodgson&apos;s shellshocked defenders could testify, as well as possessing outlandish skill, he is a mountain of a man as well, and teak tough. In his teens he became a black belt in taekwondo, and at one stage thought about jacking in football to work at the Malmo docks.

On screen sits a lavish spread of nude bodies and looping calligraphy, while off-screen comes the quiet flap of seat-backs as maybe 30 punters bail out and run for cover. In the meantime I&apos;m wondering about the punters that remain. How many are staying for the art and how many for the sex? Or could it be that there&apos;s no real difference between the two? Goltzius and the Pelican Company spins a tale of eroticism and religious hypocrisy; an examination of the symbiotic relationship between art and sex. The hero is Hendrik Goltzius (Ramsey Nasr), a 16th-century Dutch engraver who convinces the wealthy Margrave (F Murray Abraham) to fund a revolutionary new printing press by having his employees enact lusty scenes from the Old Testament. But Goltzius, it transpires, is playing with fire. The Margrave is variously seduced and scandalised. The religious establishment is up in arms. On balance, I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t join the exodus of escapees at the premiere. Whatever the failings of Greenaway as a storyteller (the over-meticulous compositions; the perceived lack of humanity), Goltzius and the Pelican Company provides food for thought and a feast for the senses. In the end there&apos;s something glorious about it. No doubt the film contains an autobiographical flavour too. Holding court in the lobby of his Rome hotel, Greenaway explains that Goltzius eventually made so much money from his printing press that he could afford to give up the day job and spend his last 10 years as a painter. &quot;And I suppose that&apos;s also my ambition,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t want to be a film-maker. I think painting is far more exciting and profound. It&apos;s always at the back of my mind \u2013 let&apos;s give up this silly business of film-making and concentrate on something more satisfying and worthwhile.&quot; In the meantime here he is, a director for his sins. Greenaway was born in Wales and raised in Essex. He trained as an artist at Walthamstow and cut his teeth as an editor at the Central Office of Information. His early features \u2013 The Draughtsman&apos;s Contract, A Zed and Two Noughts \u2013 saw him hailed as one of the most distinctive, provocative talents of his generation, while 1989&apos;s operatic The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover nudged him perilously close to mainstream success. His chosen subjects are sex and death; his inspirations are Rubens, Bruegel, Van Eyck. At the age of 70, with his pinstripe suit and sensible hair, he resembles an ageing bank manager toiling \u2013 not altogether successfully \u2013 to restrain his puckish inner nature.     A scene from Peter Greenaway's Goltzius and the Pelican Company    It strikes me, however, that Greenaway&apos;s parallels with Goltzius may extend further. The film shows the ways in which &quot;new technology must get into bed with lechery&quot; and how its hero is forced to use his art in the service of titillation. In documenting this transaction, Greenaway might be accused of doing the same. His film is positively bulging with scenes of striptease and threesomes, incest and adultery. Well, yes, says Greenaway. Sex sells and that&apos;s an interesting issue. He points out that every emergent visual phenomenon is at least partly seeded by erotic taboos. You can see it with oil painting in the Venetian period, photography in the 1840s, cinema in the 1890s and the internet today. And all of this is fine and fascinating; a rich source of drama and inquiry. He sips at his water and fixes me with a beady stare. &quot;Are you trying to make me out to be a pornographer?&quot;  No, I tell him. Not necessarily, although I am interested in where he draws the line. Goltzius, after all, reasoned that the depiction of sex makes his art more saleable. I&apos;m wondering if, in the process of staging a movie, Greenaway performs the same calculations. &quot;That&apos;s a very naive question,&quot; he says waspishly. &quot;You&apos;ve seen my previous films: they&apos;ve always been pretty frank about notions of sexuality. You&apos;ve seen it in The Cook, the Thief. You&apos;ve seen it in Drowning By Numbers, The Baby of Macon. So this subject is nothing new. Maybe inch by inch we push things forward a little bit, but I believe this is a credible and honourable use of a contemporary vocabulary. It&apos;s a film about how sex and religion refuse to get into bed with each other. So throw away your Daily Mail hat because I don&apos;t believe it fits you anyway. You&apos;re fishing for some sensationalism and I\u00a0don&apos;t think that&apos;s worthy of you.&quot; It is Greenaway&apos;s long-held belief that cinema has somehow missed its calling. It&apos;s a visual medium in thrall to the written word. &quot;Whether you&apos;re Godard or Almodovar or Scorsese, it&apos;s text, text, text. Everything begins with the text and this is a source of great anguish to me. So please let cinema get on with doing what it does best, which is expressing ideas in visual terms.&quot; When scripting his own films he tries to compose them like a musical score, labouring for them to work &quot;vertically as well as horizontally&quot;. He concedes that if they&apos;re not easy to write, they&apos;re even harder to read and often induce a state of panic in the actors he hires. Ideally, he says, he&apos;d like to push the envelope still further. Toss out the narrative rulebook and rely on a purely visual language. But a career is sustained by striking the right balance between risk and reassurance: &quot;I don&apos;t want to commit creative suicide.&quot; I suspect he likes his reputation as a polarising figure, the recessive gene of contemporary cinema. For every person who reveres his work, there are many others who regard it as arid, cerebral and insular. &quot;It&apos;s a big criticism of Greenaway films that they are far too interested in formalism and not enough interested in notions of emotional content,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a criticism I can fully understand from a public that has been brought up by Hollywood movies that demand intense emotional rapport. But look, we&apos;re here and we&apos;re talking, not because of emotional rapport but because of an intellectual ability to discuss the issues. And I think, if only to lighten the load or change the perspective, there&apos;s a place for that too. We have more than enough deodorised, over-the-top, sentimental cinema. Let&apos;s try to bring a little human intelligence into things. It can be very rewarding.&quot; Greenaway quit England 16 years ago and lives in Amsterdam with his second wife and two young children. He seems happy and engaged, with a whole raft of projects (films, paintings, installations) at various stages of development. But he will have to get a move on. At 80, he says, he plans to kill himself. I can&apos;t believe he&apos;s serious; I bet he chickens out. &quot;Well, OK,&quot; he concedes. &quot;I admit that death is not just about you, it&apos;s also about the people who love you. I have a child of 11 and a child of eight and they&apos;re not going to want Daddy to disappear. But I am seriously thinking about it and I could do it in Holland.&quot; He argues that the world is too full and it belongs to the young. &quot;I can&apos;t think of anyone who has done anything remotely useful after the age of 80. One or two late prints by Picasso. One or two late paintings by Titian. Now you might say, &apos;Well, I&apos;ve got this grandfather who&apos;s a beautiful old gentleman and rocks the cradle.&apos; But really, is he not just taking up space? OK Grandad, happy 80th birthday. Here&apos;s your cake and here&apos;s the needle.&quot; What he longs for, I think, is the perfect formalist&apos;s death. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; he says. &quot;And wouldn&apos;t that be wonderful? Wouldn&apos;t it be wise to make a good death for yourself? We all know that we&apos;re going to die, but we don&apos;t know when. That&apos;s not a blessing, that&apos;s a curse. Imagine if we knew. If you knew when you were going to die, wouldn&apos;t you make your life more worthwhile?&quot; I don&apos;t know, I tell him. I hope so, but I&apos;m not sure it works that way.  &quot;Well OK,&quot; says Greenaway. &quot;Hope, hope, hope. Hang on to the hope.&quot; He reaches for his water and gulps it down like belladonna. \u2022 Watch A Zed and Two Noughts, in a double bill with Distant Voices, Still Lives here.", "sentences": ["It can be very rewarding.&quot; Greenaway quit England 16 years ago and lives in Amsterdam with his second wife and two young children."], "title": "Peter Greenaway: 'I plan to kill myself when I'm 80'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/15/peter-greenaway-plans-to-kill-himself", "tags": ["Peter Greenaway", "Film", "Sex", "Death and dying", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-16T22:55:06Z", "article": "The engagement diary of a leading conductor can reveal many things: musical taste, status, popularity with players, administrators and audiences. But rarely has a schedule acted so neatly as a potted biography as Semyon Bychkov&apos;s does this month. November&apos;s concerts have included performances in St Petersburg (where he was brought up and trained as a musician), Vienna (where he arrived in 1974 with $100 to his name as a Jewish exile from the Soviet Union), the US (where he made his home and established his musical reputation), Tel Aviv and London (where he has recently been awarded honorary positions with both the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Academy of Music). &quot;I wish I could say it was all a magnificent design,&quot; he shrugs, &quot;but there was no design. However, when the pattern was pointed out to me, the symbolism was unmistakeable.&quot; That Bychkov&apos;s 60th birthday also falls this month adds to the seeming import of these trips down his personal memory lanes. &quot;It is interesting that all this comes around the time of an apparently significant birthday, when it is common to look both forward and back,&quot; he says. &quot;Over the years I have played music I have often felt that my relationship with time is a little strange. The past and the present do sometimes come together in the most unexpected ways.&quot; The day after he arrived in Vienna in 1974 Bychkov found himself standing in front of the Staastsoper watching the audience go in to see a new production of Wagner&apos;s Lohengrin. Thirty years later to the day, he was the conductor of a new Staatsoper Lohengrin. His prize as an outstanding student in Leningrad was to conduct Rachmaninoff&apos;s second symphony with the Leningrad Philharmonic, but his application for an exit visa ensured that the authorities stopped the concert. On his first return visit to his conservatoire in the city 35 years later, this was the piece he conducted. Born in Leningrad in 1952, Bychkov was part of a remarkable musical family; his younger brother was the conductor Yakov Kreizberg, who later became estranged from the family and died last year, aged 51. By the age of six Bychkov was giving piano concerts. He attended the Glinka Choir school and then applied, aged only 17, for the conducting course at the Leningrad Conservatoire. &quot;The piano was my instrument, but from the beginning my ambitions were not married to a desire to become a pianist. Then as now I wanted to express music through conducting, because the repertoire that meant the most to me also included the orchestral and the operatic.&quot; An application from someone so young was highly unorthodox, in that it was widely assumed that you had to be a mature musician even to consider conducting. It was also risky in another way. If he hadn&apos;t been accepted he couldn&apos;t then change courses, &quot;and I would have been sent to the army. But as things turned out, I never had to shoot a gun.&quot; Despite being a star pupil, when Bychkov&apos;s critical views on the Soviet system were reported to the authorities he was obliged to apply for an exit visa, which resulted in him being ostracised within the conservatoire. &quot;I feel no bitterness towards some of the people there who condemned me,&quot; he says. &quot;They had no choice but to condemn, unless they wanted to find themselves in the same situation. But I had a very bitter sense of rejection of a system that claimed it was the most just and progressive society on the planet when it was not. It was one that made people lie and cheat and behave in a way they would not choose to do naturally. But it also inspired people to find a way to resist. This partly answers the question as to how a music like Shostakovich&apos;s was possible in a place that clamped down so heavily on free thought.&quot; After his emigration, Bychkov&apos;s father, a scientist, was denied his own exit visa. &quot;But things started to change 12 years later when Gorbachev came to power, and people gradually began to say what they felt. Soon afterwards I met my father at Vienna airport.&quot; Although his father was persecuted specifically because he was Jewish, Bychkov says he didn&apos;t have a religious upbringing and didn&apos;t even know the traditions of Judaism. &quot;My grandfather was observant, but because he was an old person he was untouched. For my parents&apos; generation, born soon after the revolution, it was a non-starter. So it was only when I came to America that I became aware of Jewish history and tradition, although I was always touched by belonging, as anyone should be. But am I observant now? No, I&apos;m not. Worse, I somehow always end up conducting on Yom Kippur. But when people point this out I say &apos;let&apos;s face it, I feel guilty enough throughout the year so I don&apos;t need a special day. I might as well make music.&apos;&quot; He says he never expected the new world to be perfect, but arriving in the US in 1975 &quot;was like being born for a second time. The fundamental things were pretty simple: freedom, opportunity and the ability to make your own decisions and then to take whatever consequences come as the result of your decisions.&quot; He enrolled at the Mannes College of Music in Manhattan, where he conducted the student orchestra. &quot;And that is the place that launched me. Even though it wasn&apos;t professional, I did Mahler and Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, and everything that happened in America came from that.&quot; His professional career began with orchestras in Grand Rapids and then Buffalo. &quot;And you begin to make decisions which, if they go well, move you from A to B to C, and if they go badly move you in more of a zigzag. But you learn that very few decisions are fatal. Planning that first season at Grand Rapids in 1980, I was like a kid in a toy store. The programme that opened my first season was Stauss&apos;s Zarathustra, intermission, Beethoven&apos;s ninth symphony. Some people were angry. They had never been to such a long concert in their lives, and they probably never will again.&quot; During the 80s he began to make guest debuts with the great American orchestras of Chicago, Boston and New York as well as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and, most notably, as a last-minute cover for Riccardo Muti with the Berlin Philharmonic. &quot;It was another return to my past. I had first encountered the Berlin phil in Leningrad in 1969. As students we couldn&apos;t afford tickets, but we always managed to get in. This time we made our way over the roof of the concert hall. It was summer, so all the windows were open, and I jumped through one. Unfortunately, it was the ladies&apos; room and the police were called. So in my first rehearsal I told the orchestra how nice it was to meet them all these years after they got me arrested.&quot; He says it took him a long time to learn how to run an orchestra. &quot;It is not meant to be easy all the time. Some decisions will be approved and some will be contested. The difficult thing is to extricate your ego from the decision. Your decision might be criticised, but that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that you are being criticised. Sometimes yes, but sometimes no. At the Buffalo Philharmonic we had a warmth of relationship from the beginning until the day I left. That simply never happened with the Orchestre de Paris. I stayed a long time [nine years] because I wanted to make it work. But it has proved to be one of life&apos;s lessons.&quot; Paris is now his principal home, where he lives with his second wife, the pianist Marielle Lab\u00e8que, one half of the Lab\u00e8que Sisters piano duo. &quot;I think it is a gift of my profession that you can get to know these countries from the inside. I feel at home in Paris, but also in America, St Petersburg, Germany, where I worked for many years, and now London.&quot; He says his attachments to the Royal Academy of Music and the BBC Symphony Orchestra have been particularly appealing because of the combination of youth and experience. &quot;As I grow older I am becoming more conscious of my obligation to share what I&apos;ve learnt with those who are coming after me. It is a natural process. When I look at the people now my age, who were once the younger generation, I see many extremely talented musicians who went on to become uninterested, bored, frustrated and unfulfilled. It is very sad. Today&apos;s youngsters have plenty of enthusiasm and idealism, and everything they play is, for them, the best thing ever. So my greatest responsibility is not to explain where they down bow, or where it goes slower \u2013 although of course that is part of it \u2013 but to show them that it is possible to go through your career without losing that enthusiasm to do anything to make the music convincing. When they look at me and they see that this dinosaur is still sweating and he has changed three shirts in three hours, they say that maybe they can do that too.&quot; In 2010 Bychkov gave up his last permanent post with an orchestra when he retired from the WDR Sinfonieorchester in Cologne. &quot;It was the first time I found myself without a permanent responsibility for an artistic institution since I was 17. I have always been a leader of something or other: a choir or a symphony orchestra or an opera house. So when I gave that up, even though my diary was full with things I wanted to do, there was a little trepidation. But the reality has been better than I ever thought it could be. As a leader, in some way, you influence the lives of the people in your organisation, and not always in ways that they find agreeable. Now that is gone I am received only for what I am able to give, which is music. So when I arrive for a concert or opera they have the best of me, and I have the best of them.&quot; Semyon Bychkov will conduct the London Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Mahler and Berg at the Barbican, London on 25 November.", "sentences": ["They had never been to such a long concert in their lives, and they probably never will again.&quot; During the 80s he began to make guest debuts with the great American orchestras of Chicago, Boston and New York as well as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and, most notably, as a last-minute cover for Riccardo Muti with the Berlin Philharmonic."], "title": "Semyon Bychkov: beating time", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/16/semyon-bychkov-beating-time", "tags": ["Classical music", "Culture", "Music", "BBC Symphony Orchestra", "Royal Academy of Music", "Conducting"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-16T23:31:01Z", "article": "Facebook was launched in February 2004. By November 2011, an estimated 100 billion photographs had been shared via the social network. By April 2012, Facebook users were posting photographs at the\u00a0rate of 300 million per day. Leaving aside the estimated 11 billion photographs\u00a0uploaded to image-based sites such\u00a0as Flickr and Instagram, we have already entered a realm where the\u00a0numbers are so vast they begin to lose their meaning. In a feature on new trends in photography, published in Frieze magazine in November/December 2011, the American artist and writer Chris Wiley made a direct link between the post-digital image overload and photography&apos;s ongoing crisis of meaning: &quot;It is indisputable that we now inhabit a world thoroughly mediatised by and glutted with the photographic image and its digital doppelganger. Everything and everyone on Earth and beyond, it would seem, has been slotted somewhere in a rapacious, ever-expanding Borgesian library of representation\u00a0that we have built for ourselves. As a result, the possibility of\u00a0making a photograph that can stake a claim to\u00a0originality has been radically called into question. Ironically, the\u00a0moment of\u00a0greatest photographic plenitude has pushed photography to the point of\u00a0exhaustion.&quot; Photography, it seems, is experiencing a prolonged crisis concerning not just its role of depicting the world around us \u2013 through portraiture, reportage or documentary \u2013 but its form and its function, its very meaning. The creative response has been, to say the least, interesting. In 2011 Michael Wolf received an honourable mention in the World\u00a0Press Photo awards for photographs that he had selected from Google&apos;s Street View, photographed on his computer screen, cropped and blown up. Is Wolf a photographer? Or is he a curator of images? Or is he, as photography&apos;s purists (of which there are many) would have it, simply another conceptual\u00a0chancer?     John Stezaker's Siren Song V (2011) Photograph: John Stezaker    In September 2012 the prestigious Deutsche B\u00f6rse photography prize was won by John Stezaker, who doesn&apos;t take photographs at all. Instead, he works with found photographs, most often publicity stills of long-forgotten film stars, which he slices then merges with other stills to make uncanny collaged portraits that seem surrealist in intent. Stezaker would be the first to say that he is not a photographer, but an artist who uses photography in his creative practice and, in doing so, interrogates the medium and its role as a so-called documenter of truth, reality\u00a0and\u00a0celebrity culture. The previous year&apos;s Deutsche B\u00f6rse shortlist featured the work of Thomas Demand, another artist who uses photography but in a very different way, creating lifesize models of real rooms and offices that are loaded with historical or social significance in terms of recent German history. He then photographs the created sites, which are often blankly unreal and denuded of detail, before destroying the models. The photograph is the only existing record of a bigger conceptual\u00a0process. Consider, too, the work of one of the giants of contemporary American photography, Gregory Crewdson, whose elaborately staged tableaux often resemble cinematic\u00a0dreamscapes. In different ways, the work of all of these artists is about the nature of the photographic \u2013 the making of the images, rather than\u00a0the taking of a photograph. Here, as with much conceptual art, the process seems\u00a0to be as important as the end\u00a0result. How cruelly ironic, then, that we\u00a0are simultaneously witnessing the sudden death\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0process that has defined photography\u00a0for so long, a procedure that began\u00a0with the insertion of a roll of film into\u00a0a mechanical\u00a0camera and\u00a0ended, via the\u00a0contact sheet, the dark room and a tray of chemicals, with the printing of a\u00a0single\u00a0image on\u00a0photographic paper. The tsunami of digital technology has swept away, or is threatening to sweep away,\u00a0so much that was\u00a0not that long ago taken for granted: rolls of film,\u00a0the film camera, dark rooms, processing\u00a0labs, contact sheets, Polaroids and Kodachrome. As with recorded music and, imminently, printed matter, photography is a world in which all that once was solid is becoming\u00a0immaterial. And yet, for all that upheaval, photography, in all of its forms, continues to prosper. There are currently more than 100 annual photography festivals worldwide, from Brighton to Bamako and beyond, as well\u00a0as several big photo fairs such as Paris Photo, Miami Photo Fair and the just launched Unseen in Amsterdam. Meanwhile, in London and New York, over the past decade or so, a host of new photography galleries have opened. This year the Photographers&apos; Gallery \u2013 Britain&apos;s main exhibition site for contemporary photography \u2013 reopened in a newly redesigned building in the centre\u00a0of\u00a0London. There is an attendant flourishing trade in photography books, whether vintage or new, and a burgeoning self-publishing scene. At\u00a0Tate Modern, meanwhile, the first curator of photography, Simon Baker, was appointed in 2009. If photography is undergoing a potentially terminal crisis, it appears to be a\u00a0vibrant, exciting and\u00a0innovative\u00a0one.     Cindy Sherman's Untitled Film Still, 1978 Photograph: Cindy Sherman/Courtesy of the artist and Metro Pictures, New York    Consider, too, the rarefied world of the global art market, where the dealers and collectors who made pop stars out of Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons have belatedly canonised the likes of Andreas Gursky, Jeff Wall and\u00a0Cindy Sherman with often hair-raisingly high prices. If you want to know how swiftly\u00a0and radically things have\u00a0changed at that level, the prices, as ever, are a good indicator. Back in 2006 the most expensive photograph in the world was a pictorial landscape, The Pond \u2013 Moonlight by Edward Steichen, which fetched \u00a31.6m at auction. Taken in 1904 by an early pioneer of the form, it is photography&apos;s equivalent of an old master. The following year, though, a photographic print by Andreas Gursky, entitled\u00a099 Cent II Diptychon (2001), fetched\u00a0\u00a31.7m \u2013 the tipping point in terms of contemporary art photography&apos;s commercial\u00a0ascendency. At present, the three most expensive photographs in the world are by living conceptual artists: Jeff Wall, Cindy Sherman\u00a0and, at the top of the league, Gursky, whose\u00a0print Rhein II (1999) fetched \u00a32.7m in\u00a0auction at Christie&apos;s New York in November 2011 (below). It is,\u00a0for the time being, the most expensive photograph ever. It is also, sceptics might say, one of the most uninteresting photographs ever: a large-format landscape in which the river Rhine sits between two swaths of green grass under a grey\u00a0sky. Like several of Gursky&apos;s works, Rhein II is a digitally manipulated image \u2013 a\u00a0factory\u00a0building and some dog walkers were removed from the original photograph by a high-end version of Adobe Photoshop. When asked to comment on this, Gursky said: &quot;Paradoxically, this view of the Rhine cannot be obtained in situ, a fictitious construction was required to provide an accurate image of a modern river.&quot;     Andreas Gursky's Rhein II  fetched \u00a32.7m last year, setting a record for any photograph sold at auction. Photograph: Andreas Gursky/AP Photo/Christie's    Make of that what you will, but the fact remains that the most expensive landscape photograph in the world right now is of a scene that never existed. What, then, of photography that is not primarily concerned with the photographic or the conceptual? What of\u00a0documentary, reportage, portraiture and street photography? These more traditional forms are thriving too, and being constantly reinvented in response to the relentlessly mediated world\u00a0we inhabit. Increasingly, the lines between genres are becoming blurred, though. Is Paul\u00a0Graham, winner of the 2009 Deutsche B\u00f6rse prize and the 2012 Hasselblad\u00a0award, a documentary photographer or an art photographer?\u00a0Or is he neither? Or both? Are the\u00a0large-format, inordinately detailed works by Mitch Epstein in his American Power series, or Edward Burtynsky in his Oil\u00a0series, part of the landscape tradition or the documentary tradition? Is the term &quot;street photography&quot; an adequate description of the urban lightscapes captured by Trent\u00a0Parke? Do these generic terms even matter any more in the (post-) modern world? Where do we place the luminously intimate work of Rinko Kawauchi or the often provocative &quot;conceptual documentary&quot; style of Pieter Hugo? Photography is adapting to survive \u2013 as it always has. The coming of the cheap, relatively complex digital camera and the smartphone means we are living in the age of the techno-amateur. This has undoubtedly changed the world of photography on one level: there are millions \u2013 billions! \u2013 more images being made, shared and stored than ever\u00a0before. One sometimes wonders what the future holds for reportage in the age of citizen journalism, in which a single dramatic image can be\u00a0captured on a bystander&apos;s mobile phone camera and instantly broadcast around the world over\u00a0the internet. The shooting of the Iranian anti-government protestor Neda Agha-Soltan in June 2009 was captured in this way and became the most widely witnessed death in\u00a0history. For all that, no amount of technology will turn a mediocre photographer into a great one. Nor, in conceptual terms, will it transform a bad idea into a good one. For that you would still need to possess a rare set of creative gifts that are still to do with seeing, with\u00a0deep looking. Photography, like print media and music, is certainly at a turning point, as the current art market most dramatically shows. But it was also at a turning point during the early- to mid-1960s, when artists such as Andy Warhol and Ed Ruscha were questioning its traditions and its modes of representation through the use of photographs in their artistic practices. You could even argue that Ruscha&apos;s artist&apos;s books of serial photographs, Twentysix Gasoline Stations (1963) and Every Building on the Sunset Strip (1966), are\u00a0among the most influential postwar photography\u00a0books. Whatever upheavals it has witnessed, photography has endured. It\u00a0continues to do so, even as we drown in a sea of uploaded images whose sheer quantity mediates against their meaning. Photography, in more\u00a0ways than one, thrives on a\u00a0crisis. The\u00a0instant endures.", "sentences": ["There are currently more than 100 annual photography festivals worldwide, from Brighton to Bamako and beyond, as well\u00a0as several big photo fairs such as Paris Photo, Miami Photo Fair and the just launched Unseen in Amsterdam."], "title": "Photography: an art form that never stands still | Guardian photography guide", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/16/sean-ohagan-photography-art-form", "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-16T23:45:01Z", "article": "There used to be a hierarchy. At the top were historic grand narratives of religious or temporal events: big\u00a0paintings of Roman heroes and famous battles. Pretty much at the bottom was the humble depiction of everyday stuff: still life. The still life is democratic; anyone can do it. Pick up a pencil and draw your lunch, as the cartoonist Robert Crumb ritualistically does. Or take your camera and survey the ordinary things around you. Click the shutter on a bunch of grapes or a bottle of ketchup. Is\u00a0that a still life? Clearly it is more complicated than that. Or\u00a0is it? The photographs of Wolfgang Tillmans appear to be genuinely random and casual, as seen in this image: Still Life, Grays Inn Road I (1999) (main image). This Turner prizewinning artist uses his camera to keep an ever-changing diary. He pins his pictures up for exhibitions as if they were on a kitchen noticeboard. They include shots of flowers, keys and whatever else happens to be around, juxtaposed with portraits of friends. The way Tillmans photographs his everyday material surroundings is so convincingly spontaneous that &quot;still life&quot; seems too formal a term to describe it. But why? Surely Tillmans is a major artist of the still life? Old perspectives, new ideas     Edward Weston's Nautilus, (1927). Photograph: Edward Weston/PR Newswire    Bear in mind the low status that was once\u00a0allotted by the art establishment to still\u00a0life. The reason this is worth remembering is that the term has taken on an almost pretentious quality nowadays. Far from suggesting something humble, it implies something grand and serious. Edward Weston&apos;s exquisitely beautiful black and white photographs, such as his Nautilus (1927) (left), aspire boldly to be art. Weston sculpts form with light. He has an ability to make a photographic print look as pure and precise in its beauty as a marble statue by Canova. But for all his brilliance, Weston embodies a dangerous myth about still life. He was an artist who came of age in the 1900s, in the glory days of high modernism. He took his photographs at a time when the revolutionary ideas of modern painting were being popularised. His noble, austere, difficult ideal of the modernist still life translates the\u00a0paintings of C\u00e9zanne and de\u00a0Chirico into\u00a0photography. The ideal we have inherited from these modernists raises the still life from zero to hero. From the humblest art it becomes a metaphysical exploration of reality that is arguably the most profound of all modern art\u00a0forms. Jasper Johns when he painted a flag, Damien Hirst when he pickled a shark, were aspiring to join that avant garde\u00a0tradition of the philosophical still life. Is this how a photographer should approach still life? Should you be looking for metaphysical bananas, or arranging dead butterflies on a table to take an artistic picture of death? Is the still life, as some might say, essentially a vanitas, or emblem of\u00a0mortality? Should you put a skull beside that array of nice food? Metaphysical boundaries At its best, the metaphysical still life can work powerfully in art photography, but the recipe for a more truthful approach to still life photography can be found in the older tradition of still life painting \u2013 in the days when it was despised by the elite.     Caravaggio's A Basket of Fruit (c 1599). Photograph: The Bridgeman Art Library    In the 18th century, when history painting ruled and still life was considered minor, the name of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio was forgotten. Today, however, his work is universally popular \u2013 and this has a lot to do with the &quot;photographic&quot; qualities of his work. Caravaggio&apos;s painting A Basket of Fruit (c 1599) that hangs in the Ambrosiana gallery in Milan is revered as the greatest still life in the world (above). It&apos;s said an ancient Greek painter called Zeuxis once depicted a bunch of grapes\u00a0so realistically that birds came down to peck at the illusory fruit. That painting no longer exists, but Caravaggio&apos;s painting makes such miracles seem possible. The basket of moist, shiny, hallucinatory fruit balances on the edge of a table, forever on the brink of tottering over, falling out of the canvas and into our dimension. Mastering the craft     Caravaggio's Supper at Emmaus, 1601. Photograph: From Caravaggio and Rembrandt exhibition at the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam    Caravaggio had an astonishing gift for depicting nature, but flowers and fruit were seen as trivial themes in baroque Italy. So he often had to incorporate his observations of the material world into narrative paintings \u2013 like his eerie Supper at Emmaus (above) \u2013 to get ahead. Look closely at the food on this table and you&apos;ll see how lighting and shadow animate and dramatise the relationships between fruits in the basket. The variety of forms and textures \u2013 such as the opened red flesh of a pomegranate, or the dusty skin of a grape \u2013 are acutely revealed by their juxtapositions. These techniques can be emulated by any photographer: arrange a rich, suggestive scene, then carefully set up the lighting. Yet Caravaggio&apos;s lesson is more subtle than it might seem. Even though his art has that &quot;photographic&quot; realism - and the artist and art historian David Hockney even argues that he used a camera obscura to compose his images - many still life photographs miss out on his deepest insight. Compare his painting of a basket of fruit with photographs on the covers of food books and in food magazines. Determined to capture the lush colours of fish scales, artichokes and even wooden tabletops in the best light possible, they end up being kitchen glamour shots rather than still life pictures.     Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin    Jonathan Lovekin&apos;s photographs in the Observer and elsewhere are good examples of\u00a0how to depict food in a more Caravaggesque way: the trick is to reveal the rich colours and contrasts and spicy textures without over-lighting the scene (left). Just as Caravaggio&apos;s light sources were high windows in Roman palaces, Lovekin often lets cool sunlight creep in to his peculiarly British scenes. Caravaggio&apos;s revelation is that the truth of objects is more fascinating than any beautified fantasy. Where is the art? It is in the loving observation of truth \u2013 with a camera as much as in paint. And yet for Caravaggio, that knowledge leads to pathos\u00a0as well as poetry. There are signs of\u00a0rot among his fruits. Opened fruits suggest\u00a0sex and death. Bruises evoke his violent world. All that deeper meaning comes\u00a0from\u00a0observation.

The Israel-born artist Ori Gersht has created powerful photographic still life images that are eerily precise. His Blow Up: Untitled 5, for instance, casts a keen eye on the colours and textures of flowers by freezing them with liquid nitrogen - so that even as he explodes the arrangement and photographs its destruction, shards of red, blue and white petals reveal their natural beauty (left).

Hitherto flying has soared above climate change regulation but from 30 April 2013 the EU dictates that it must sign up to emissions trading. In common with other heavily polluting industries, this means putting a cap on CO\u00b2 emissions for planes arriving or departing from EU airports. Airlines would trade in pollution permits on an aviation carbon market. The theory is that fleets that are low carbon would be rewarded and this would incentivise airlines to invest in eco-friendly fleets. OK, so this is no tax on aviation fuel and there&apos;s plenty of turbulence to come \u2013 industry lobbyists are battling like fury to water down legislation, and outside the EU some carriers are refusing to report their emissions. (Preposterously, China claims dispensation on account of being a developing country.) But the fact that the aviation industry is being made to act like other massive energy consumers (US commercial airlines burn about 50m gallons of kerosene per day) may offer you comfort. It&apos;s true, this industry can be hard to love. Traditionally it&apos;s countered criticism by provoking &quot;hairy environmentalists&quot; (so termed by Michael O&apos;Leary of Ryanair) or by pleading that air travel contributes just 2% of greenhouse gas emissions. Critics contend that this doesn&apos;t factor in radiative forcing: at altitude, the negative effects of burning kerosene are amplified to the power of three. Let&apos;s be fair: there has been some eco innovation. Aircraft have been updated for more efficient models. Check each airline to get the &quot;environmental&quot; sell on its fleets (the newer the better). But gains in fuel efficiency can only go so far. Some airlines, notably BA and Virgin, have switched attention to alternative fuel sources, meaning biofuels. Virgin Atlantic flew a plane to Amsterdam in 2008 with one engine using a\u00a0proportion of coconut oil and babassu nuts; other airlines have used jatropha oil and even algae, upping the biofuel content in each flight. Butit&apos;s still a tiny proportion of aviation fuel, and where will land-based crops be grown? On land needed for food? Despite so many unanswered questions, even climate-change protestors seem to fly these days (I note some picked up their boarding passes after the Copenhagen climate change negotiations collapsed. Was this the ultimate display of kick-the-planet frustration?). Unfortunately there is still no such thing as an eco jetsetter. Green crush: Levi&apos;s Water&lt;Less and Waste&lt;Less collections As eco fashion took some time to cast off its sackcloth image, there may be mixed feelings about the return of the eco-friendly dungaree. Following its Water&lt;Less\u00a0collection (denim made with a\u00a0fraction of the water \u2013 Levi&apos;s has already made more than 13m products and saved more than 172m litres of water), Levi&apos;s will launch Waste&lt;Less jeans in January. Each piece contains at least 20% recycled plastic bottles. And for those who think dungarees are\u00a0best left to\u00a0Meryl Streep in Mamma Mia!, there will be a 511 skinny jean and a 407 straight fit, too.

And having enjoyed the frisson of sensation with which my jottings about my mother and casual buggery had been received, was emboldened to embark upon a second volume. I had made no preparation for leaving Christie&apos;s, which I departed in 1967 having resisted the fumbling frottage behind the Fragonards with the many public-school so-called heterosexuals working there, for whom the phallus remained an object of fascination. So I was forced to live in a dilapidated house in Barnes. My lover at the time was Claudio, a floppy-haired Quattrocento Sicilian, for whom I had almost as much affection as I had for my dog, though my promiscuity remained largely untamed due, for the most part, to my proximity to the Thames where there was never any shortage of muscular rowers to be found behind the boatsheds. A living, if that is what it can be called, I made from selling a couple of undistinguished Titians, and, within a year, I was thoroughly exhausted by the unrelenting sodomy that I had forced on myself. In need of a rest, I took myself to Cadaqu\u00e9s where Salvador Dal\u00ed forced me to masturbate in front of his Debris Christ, an act that was unrewarding for us both. Dal\u00ed told me that he had an exceedingly small anal aperture, and, the following year, I took him an instrument from a medical suppliers in Wigmore Street to enlarge it. The Mentmore sale of old masters was a high point, I suppose, though I could not accept the attributions of some lamentable Leonardos and, throughout the 70s, spent a great many days in Fortnum and Mason&apos;s, watching Lucian Freud thrust his pudgy fingers up the skirt of a lubricious girl as if into a ripe persimmon. It was also my misfortune to spend equal amounts of time with corpulent Cork Street dealers and gallery panjandrums who couldn&apos;t distinguish a real Rembrandt from a sixth-form pastiche: only a prolonged cleansing in the bath houses of New York and Amsterdam could rid me of their ill-informed stench. Most of my summers were spent travelling in Turkey as there was nothing more invigorating than viewing the troglodyte churches of Cappadocia by day, and being sucked off by a Turkish boy at night. Not even the vision of Bernard Breslauer&apos;s minuscule, mephitic penis being attended to by a swarm of dis-interested amputees, nor my dear friend Jill&apos;s clumsy attempts to entice me towards her desiccated vagina, can spoil the memories of such perfect, untroubled times, which ended with the exposure of Anthony Blunt as a Russian spy. Seldom can the establishment have acted with such hypocrisy: it is an unforgivable outrage that Anthony&apos;s brilliance in cataloguing the works of Poussin should have been overshadowed by such a trivial matter. Anthony&apos;s fall from grace coincided with my mother&apos;s dementia, which made her even more hateful than before, and I was not at all sorry when she later died, for she had made both my life \u2013 and those of the many thousands of men whom she had chanced upon fisting me in her kitchen \u2013 an abject misery. With work drying up, I was forced to embark on the life of a miserable scribe, first for that frightful frump Libby Purves at the Tatler, then for the Mail on Sunday and the Evening Standard. It has, for the most part, been an entirely unrewarding experience, working for vicious lesbians and servile lickspittles who would rather I wrote 800 words on the vacuous Tracey Emin than allow me three weeks to consider the importance of Titian. Not even frequent fucks in the third-floor lavatories of Harrod&apos;s could relieve such painful longueurs. Thus I carry on alone and un-regarded, awaiting the inevitable final heart attack that will remove me from these quotidian travails. And now I must leave you to masturbate myself, for there is no one left to perform the task for me.

Yes, the man who finally delivered the Champions League to the Russian with the goofy grin is out and likely to be replaced by a Spaniard with facial hair. But contrary to expectations, the figure in question is not Pep Guardiola but instead Rafael Ben\u00edtez, with the former Liverpool manager having, according to reports, already spoken to Abramovich about taking over at Stamford Bridge on a short-term contract, most likely until the end of the season when yet another attempt to lure Guardiola out of his New York sabbatical will be attempted. If Di Matteo is looking for tea and sympathy in the coming days he can always turn to Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, who knows exactly what it feels like to &quot;part company&quot; with Chelsea. He is now at Tottenham, of course, and will apparently be handed a &quot;\u00a320m kitty&quot; in January to boost the club&apos;s stuttering attempts to qualify for the Champions League. Roma&apos;s Miralem Pjanic, Ajax&apos;s Christian Eriksen, CSKA Moscow&apos;s Alan Dzagoev and Porto&apos;s Jo\u00e3o Moutinho are all said to be on Spurs&apos; radar. Across north London, meanwhile, Arsenal are weighing up a \u00a35m move for Ajax goalkeeper Kenneth Vermeer, with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger having sent scouts to Amsterdam last week to watch the 26-year-old make his Holland debut against Germany. More now on the less-than-inspirational tale of Stewart Downing&apos;s career. Having made next to no impact at Liverpool following his \u00a320m move from Aston Villa (still hard to believe, isn&apos;t it?), it appears Downing could be on his way to Middlesbrough, with the north-east club interested in bringing the winger back to his boyhood club. Any deal is initially likely to be on loan. On his way to Anfield, meanwhile, could be Jeffr\u00e9n Su\u00e1rez. The 24-year-old Sporting Lisbon winger (no relation to Luis), has been of interest to Brendan Rodgers for some time and may be Merseyside-bound as early as January. As could John Stones, the Barnsley right-back who is wanted by Everton. The England Under-19 international has apparently been watched by David Moyes&apos;s &quot;spies&quot; for some time. There are also transfer rumblings in East Anglia, with Ipswich keen on signing Southampton goalkeeper Kelvin Davies, and Norwich interested in Swansea striker Danny Graham. Graham was the Welsh club&apos;s top-scorer last season with 14 goals but has struggled to establish himself under Michael Laudrup and may be allowed to move to Carrow Road for \u00a35m. And finally, David Beckham is wanted by clubs from six different countries having announced his decision to leave LA Galaxy on Tuesday. Paris Saint-Germain remain favourites to sign the 37-year-old, but there is also interest from Australia, China, Brazil, South Africa and Russia. Oh, what&apos;s this, West Ham also want the boy from Leytonstone. Make that seven different countries, then.

Since then, there have been high-profile deaths, a huge demonstration and an election in which the mayor promised the London Cycling Campaign that he would &quot;go Dutch&quot;. Now the London assembly has weighed in with an excellent report setting out the steps the mayor must take to reboot his revolution. Since he was elected for his first term, the mayor has made some improvements. The cycle hire scheme has been a huge \u2013 if relatively expensive \u2013 success, and the cycle superhighways, even if badly designed and implemented, have seen rapid increases in cycling. But cycling levels, previously rocketing upwards at 10-15% a year, appear to have reached a plateau. In the second quarter of this year, cycling levels dropped 10% on the year before, which Transport for London attributes to poor weather conditions in April to June. Until 2007 the risk of cycling was falling while cycling increased. Since then both nationally and in London, cycle casualties have been increasing faster than the rate of cycling, undermining the idea that if you get more people cycling, it will inevitably become safer. In evidence to the London assembly, cycle safety experts from Denmark and the Netherlands both pointed to the fact that safety of cycling in cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam has improved at the same time that cycling has increased - the &quot;safety in numbers&quot; idea. So why hasn&apos;t this been happening in the last few years in London? Well, the idea of safety in numbers is not purely a result of a relative increase in cycling. CTC has pointed out that safety must be improved, but the focus must be on interventions that also increase cycling levels, not measures that restrict, or put the responsibility solely on cyclists. To achieve safety in numbers you need to overcome the barriers to cycling \u2013 chiefly the fear of injury \u2013 and tackle the sources of danger. Broadly speaking, this requires reduced speeds and better quality cycling infrastructure, together with improved road user behaviour. It&apos;s the last of these points that marks the really substantive change over the last few years. According to recent figures CTC acquired from the Home Office, in 2008 the Metropolitan police cut its traffic policing force in half \u2013 from 612 officers to just 290, and it&apos;s barely recovered since then. Unless there is systematic policing of the road network, bad drivers will continue to go unpunished. We know that most cycle casualties are the fault of the driver, so the emphasis must be on enforcing the law and preventing bad driving occurring in the first place. Of course, it&apos;s not just about policing. The main thrust of the London assembly&apos;s report is focused on infrastructure. This is where there has been a growing demand from campaigning organisations, bloggers and the general public. The problem with so much existing cycle infrastructure is that it does little to improve safety, but also undermines the status of cycling, relegating them to a narrow, unhelpful cycle lane the users of which must give way to all other road users. Part of the problem the assembly report has identified is that regulations outlaw the simple measures that are commonly used in the rest of Europe to provide good quality facilities \u2013 things like small traffic lights at cycling eye-level or simple markings to give priority over motor traffic. The London assembly has called not only for more resources to go to the junction review - which is reviewing the 500 worst junctions in London \u2013it also wants the mayor to follow  the lead of New York, which has introduced cheap and cheerful - but reasonable quality - cycling facilities by taking away space from motor traffic. The 2012 Games Lanes - incorrectly forecast to lead to traffic mayhem - show how space can be easily acquired from motor traffic for alternative transport needs if the political will is there. Better cycling infrastructure, an enforced road traffic law and a reduction in the space available to motor traffic are all required to get cycling growing again in London. Meanwhile, nationally, we inevitably will have to follow London&apos;s lead - in the capital, spending on cycling is \u00a310 per head. In Amsterdam it&apos;s \u00a320. For everywhere else in Britain it&apos;s barely \u00a32. \u2022 Chris Peck is the policy coordinator of the UK&apos;s national cyclists&apos; organisation, the CTC", "sentences": ["In evidence to the London assembly, cycle safety experts from Denmark and the Netherlands both pointed to the fact that safety of cycling in cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam has improved at the same time that cycling has increased - the &quot;safety in numbers&quot; idea.", "In Amsterdam it&apos;s \u00a320."], "title": "Why is there no safety in numbers for London's cyclists? | Chris Peck", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2012/nov/21/safety-london-cyclists", "tags": ["Road safety", "London", "UK news", "Cycling", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-21T18:12:53Z", "article": "Two eminent, widely published and very different photojournalists give a Guardian Masterclass in telling stories with images.

Her off-guard portraits are testament to the delicate relationships photojournalists construct with individuals and how powerful and revealing they can be. This masterclass is a must for any photographer wanting to explore and develop their documentary practice. It includes a Q&amp;A session with the tutors, and promises to offer compelling first-hand testimony and the kind of tips you only get with a lot of experience.

A sleepwalking home defence dawdled and when Angel Di Mar\u00eda swung in a cross from the right Maicon watched Karim Benzema wander away to slot home past a helpless Joe Hart. Cut to a Roberto Mancini looking embarrassed at what he had witnessed. A few moments later the emotion on the City manger&apos;s face was fury: this time Cristiano Ronaldo skipped past Maicon too easily and flipped in a ball from the left that Sami Khedira, again unmarked, hit just wide. Lax defending and an unhappy search for fluidity and a menacing edge have killed City in this second campaign among the continent&apos;s elite. When the team sheet dropped the first thought was that Mancini had conceded the tilt at the European Cup and was resting some of his more trusted talent for Sunday&apos;s trip to Chelsea in the Premier League, the competition City lead by a point. Gareth Barry and Carlos Tevez were not in the XI, with the manager plumping for a 3-5-2 that had Edin Dzeko partnering Sergio Ag\u00fcero in attack and Maicon and Aleksandar Kolarov the wingbacks. The formation would not last the opening half \u2013 further evidence of Mancini&apos;s fumbling search for a successful strategy. All the talk before a match City were required to win to keep any faint hope still flickering consisted of not giving up. In his programme notes, Mancini was at it again: &quot;I&apos;ve said before that our task is now very difficult, but this won&apos;t affect our attitude or effort in our remaining two games,&quot; he said. &quot;We will be giving everything to beat Madrid and [Borussia] Dortmund and end with eight points \u2013 if that is enough to take us into the knockout stages I think it will be our destiny to go on and do very well in this competition.&quot; Maicon had impressed as a wing-back when Mancini switched to three central defenders and he entered as a second half replacement in the 2-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur in this stadium 10 days ago. But against the big teams the system comes across as still in an embryonic stage, hardly the mode required to take on a side featuring a Ronaldo intent on making mugs of the cross-town rivals during his six years at Manchester United. Maicon, the right-back in Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s 2010 Champions League winners Internazionale, enjoyed his sole moment of light before the break on 27 minutes. A give-and-go with Ag\u00fcero swept the Brazilian into the Real Madrid area \u2013 the home side&apos;s first foray there during the period \u2013 but the shot came to nothing. By around this juncture Mancini was informing his team to revert to the usual 4-2-3-1, and when the second half started it was Javi Garc\u00eda, not Barry, who was brought on for Kolarov as the specialist in the holding role alongside Yaya Tour\u00e9. One indictment of City&apos;s display before the teams changed ends was that Ag\u00fcero&apos;s spin-and-shot on 21 minutes and an earlier Kolarov free-kick that Iker Casillas punched away were about as good as it got. A deeper fault-line in this doomed Champions League quest is the difficulty in nominating any star turn during the five group games now played. Tour\u00e9 has plodded, at best. Samir Nasri, pulled off here on the hour for Tevez, has been virtually anonymous. Questions asked of Vincent Kompany at crucial moments have not been answered by the captain, like the duck under Ronaldo&apos;s winner in the opening group match between these teams. Tevez has no goals in the competition and Ag\u00fcero, who was injured at the season&apos;s start, two. The second of those came with the 73rd-minute penalty the Argentinian won here and coolly converted. Mancini had also written: &quot;Our problem has been concentration during Champions League games this season \u2013 if we had defended better for those final few moments in the Bernab\u00e9u [in the 3-2 loss] and focused harder in Amsterdam [a 3-1 defeat] and again when Ajax visited us [2-2], I think we would now be in a much stronger situation.

It was painted shortly after Amy Winehouse died, aged 27, last year.  Photograph: Marlene Dumas/PA    A melancholy painting of Amy Winehouse, made shortly after the singer&apos;s death in July 2011, has been acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in London. The work by South African artist Marlene Dumas is not huge \u2013 no bigger than a sheet of A3 paper \u2013 but it packs a punch carrying &quot;tremendous emotive power&quot;, said the gallery&apos;s contemporary curator Sarah Howgate. &quot;Detail bleeds into and out of her work, directing and dispersing the gaze of the viewer.&quot; The title, Amy-Blue, and the translucent colours used by Dumas point to the singer&apos;s musical influences as much to the melancholy of her life. Winehouse&apos;s father Mitch Winehouse said: &quot;It is a fantastic piece of work and we are fascinated to know how Amy was seen and remembered by family, friends and artists of all kinds. With the Amy Winehouse Foundation, Amy is our inspiration and it is profoundly moving to find that she still inspires so many others too.&quot; It has been acquired by the gallery with support from the fundraising charity The Art Fund. Dumas, who is based in Amsterdam, sought out images of Winehouse online for the work which draws the viewer in to the singer&apos;s distinctive eyes and eye liner. The portrait is the gallery&apos;s first painted image of Winehouse, although the collection does have photographic portraits by Mischa Richter and Venetia Dearden. It went on public display at the gallery today, given an entire wall to itself and is the first portrait that visitors will see as they enter the contemporary galleries from the main entrance.", "sentences": ["Dumas, who is based in Amsterdam, sought out images of Winehouse online for the work which draws the viewer in to the singer&apos;s distinctive eyes and eye liner."], "title": "Amy Winehouse painting acquired for National Portrait Gallery", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/26/amy-winehouse-painting-national-portrait-gallery", "tags": ["Amy Winehouse", "National Portrait Gallery", "Art", "Art and design", "Music", "Museums", "Culture", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-27T14:42:01Z", "article": "Traditionally, Christmas is the time when if you&apos;re going to give someone a book, you give them a hardback. Well, I&apos;ve always thought so, anyway. (Incidentally, no one&apos;s given me a book for Christmas for some time now. They don&apos;t get it, do they? I like books.) Paperbacks are seen as slightly cheap; and as for a Kindle upload, or whatever they&apos;re called, eurgh, over my dead, cold body. But times are hard now, and paperbacks are cheaper, and they take up less space. So here is a selection of the paperbacks I&apos;ve liked this year; some are from small publishers, and every day you buy something from one of them is Christmas day for them, too. Anyone who loves literature also likes teasing it, so they&apos;ll love John Gross&apos;s Oxford Book of Parodies, pretty much every writer from the dawn of Eng lit gets it in the neck. Witness John Clarke&apos;s demolition job on Edward Lear: &quot;There was an old man with a beard, / A funny old man with a beard. / He had a big beard, / A great big old beard, / That amusing old man with a beard.&quot; One of my favourite books of the year was Robert Walser&apos;s Berlin Stories. This, published by New York Review Books, is a collection of vignettes written as if by some kind of innocent angel, or holy fool. His celebration of the ordinary is like seeing things for the first time, and for his almost mindless optimism not to irritate but to charm shows a sincere genius. Everyone who reads him falls in love with him. Even Kafka did. (A companion for this book is \u2013 also NYRB \u2013 Amsterdam Stories by Nescio.) My favourite science-cum-history book of the year was Jane Brox&apos;s Brilliant (Souvenir), which tells the story of artificial light, including the amazing detail that candles in the Shetlands used to be made by sticking a wick down the throat of a dead petrel. Sonia Purnell&apos;s Just Boris (Aurum) is an indispensable examination into the mind, ambitions and deep insecurities of London&apos;s mayor; Boris hates it because she dares speak truth to power. You must know someone who likes poetry, surely, so they&apos;ll love it if you get them Carcanet&apos;s Collected Poems of Elizabeth Jennings. It costs a bit but you do get well over 1,000 poems, with barely a duff one; heck, you could even give it to someone who doesn&apos;t like poetry, and suggest it will change their mind. You must know someone who likes HP Lovecraft, or MR James&apos;s ghost stories, or atmospheric stories about weird goings on: so they&apos;ll like Penguin Classics&apos;s selection of Arthur Machen, The White People and Other Weird Stories. Underneath it all is a troubled fear of atavism and sexuality \u2013 but also inspirational, surely, for Douglas Adams&apos;s Dirk Gently detective stories. For the cricket-lover in your life \u2013 and if you are a civilised human being, you will have a cricket-lover in your life \u2013 get Chinaman by Shehan Karunatilaka (Vintage), a deliberately rambling account of a dying sportswriter&apos;s attempts to get to the truth of the disappearance of a Sri Lankan bowler. It&apos;s really about Sri Lanka, but it does help just a wee bit to know something about cricket. (And if you do, it&apos;s brilliant.) If you know someone who loathes sport, then give them Barbaric Sport by Marc Perelman (Verso), which rails against the encroaching brainlessness and greed of the sporting establishment (do not, under any circumstances, buy anyone The Nolympics (Penguin), a slovenly, mean-minded and cynical look at this year&apos;s Olympics by some illiterate masquerading under my own name). One of the best war books I have ever read was Midge Gillies&apos;s The Barbed Wire University (Aurum), the story of allied PoWs during the second world war; the tales of courage, resilience and bloody-minded mischief in the face of intolerable oppression had this stony-hearted reviewer in tears. A passion for romantic Borgesianism will be satisfied by Hector Abad&apos;s Recipes for Sad Women (Pushkin), cute vignettes which address a darker sadness; and anyone who fails to be charmed \u2013 no, delighted \u2013 by Jenny Diski&apos;s What I don&apos;t Know About Animals (Virago) must have something wrong with them. And if you, like me, don&apos;t consider collected columns a con, you must get Howard Jacobson&apos;s Whatever It Is, I Don&apos;t Like It (Bloomsbury), if only for the title alone \u2013 but the trick is he likes lots of things. Loves them, in fact. But the book I would most like to thrust on people is Marcel Aym\u00e9&apos;s The Man Who Walked Through Walls (Pushkin), stories which have now become some of my all-time favourites. Which reminds me, because they are so well translated, of David Bellos&apos;s Is That a Fish in Your Ear? (Particular Books), which is about translation, and has very much deserved its somewhat surprising success. As for me, it&apos;s not a paperback but for Christmas I would like Mrs Weber&apos;s Omnibus by Posy Simmonds (Jonathan Cape), please. \u2022 To order titles with free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846. theguardian.com/bookshop", "sentences": ["(A companion for this book is \u2013 also NYRB \u2013 Amsterdam Stories by Nescio.)"], "title": "Christmas books: paperback choice", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/27/christmas-books-nicholas-lezard-paperbacks-roundup", "tags": ["Paperbacks", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-11-29T12:20:00Z", "article": "A minivan with an unusual group of passengers moves through the countryside and villages of western Uganda. Its passengers take in the poverty but also the very visible signs of a dynamic rural economy. Lorries move maize across porous borders to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and southern Sudan, and take the local staple matooke (cooking banana) from roadside collecting points to the capital Kampala. The vast majority of this produce comes from small farms. Like many regions that were once considered remote, this area is now heavily influenced by national, regional and global trade. And alongside that trade comes the globalisation of expectations, with youth looking beyond the farm for their future. The passengers in the minivan know that the world&apos;s half-billion smallholdings are carrying a heavy weight of expectations. Small-scale farmers are being cast as the future guardians of global food security, as new partners with big business, and as central to the adaptation of agriculture to climate change. These expectations also come with no shortage of external advice on how small-scale farmers should organise themselves in the market. Many donors, businesses and NGOs are now looking for ways to bring small-scale farmers into &quot;inclusive&quot; trade with big business, through producer organisations and co-operatives. Last week, a large conference in Addis Ababa added to calls for small-scale farmers to be brought into modern value chains, supported by government policy. But a strong counter-argument calls on smallholders to resist the forces of globalisation and protect their rights before they are swept aside in the rush for land, food supplies and profits. The proposed solution to the smallholder &apos;problem&apos; strongly mirrors the politics of each advocate&apos;s organisation. But this particular minivan driving through western Uganda contains a much more diverse set of outlooks \u2013 a &quot;learning network&quot; of leaders from the worlds of business, farming, civil society, and research. The network formed in 2010 to generate new insights on how smallholders can ride the big waves of change that are sweeping through the countryside. Convened by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and the Dutch development organisation Hivos, and led from Bolivia, the network set out to generate and integrate its own knowledge on smallholders and globalisation. Their work has also been complemented by a series of debates in Europe on some of the core dilemmas at the heart of smallholder agriculture. The network will launch the results in Amsterdam on 29 November, as a book and three regional reports, which challenge our assumptions of the roles of smallholders and agribusiness. All are free to download from the IIED website. The work, based on a three-year study, cautions that globalisation and modernisation are not sweeping away informal and local economies, but spreading in parallel with them. What is clear to see from this minivan in western Uganda \u2013 and throughout the developing and emerging economies \u2013 is that the majority of small-scale farmers act around and outside the borders of formal &apos;modern&apos; markets. Indeed, in countries with weak central authority, the cracks where small farmers can find spaces for economic and political agency may be so large that the informal economy becomes the mainstream, as in Bolivia. We should not continue to expect multiple wins \u2013 on poverty reduction, food security, and rural development \u2013 from the single-minded approach of including farmers and their organisations in value chains and &quot;empowering&quot; them in markets as beneficiaries of external initiatives. To get the future right for the majority of small-scale producers who cannot readily participate in modern value chains, or for the many youth with aspirations out of farming, we must recognise other layers of the picture. The current debate has paid too little attention to small farmers as active economic agents making choices in multiple markets, under multiple resource constraints. Understanding farmers&apos; own strategies, interests, expectations and limitations will contribute to better informed policies that do more for inclusive economic growth, social cohesion, and small-scale farmers&apos; wellbeing.

More than 800 people died and more than 3 million were affected in what was, for insurers, the most costly fresh water flood in history. More recently, an extreme storm in Beijing took 79 lives. And then hurricane Sandy showed us that even the most advanced cities cannot always protect themselves from the elements. According to reinsurance company Swiss Re, flooding affects 500 million people a year and the financial losses have risen from less than $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) to $15bn (\u00a39.4bn) per year in less than four decades. I&apos;ve previously written that sustainable cities&apos; principal goal is their long term economic competitiveness. Livability, good environmental stewardship and efficiency can help attract talent and investment. That talent and investment may not be deterred by vulnerable cities but it can be repelled by cities that fail to make themselves resilient. China may be especially exposed. A recent OECD report showed that six of the cities with the highest potential asset risk are Chinese, including Guangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin and Hong Kong. Their combined population is 68.5 million, more than the total population of the UK. However, in Shanghai, where I moved earlier this year, investment in infrastructure and sustainable initiatives is impressive. Shanghai is making great progress in providing a more livable and attractive urban environment but its growth is putting its resources under strain and testing its infrastructure&apos;s ability to handle extreme weather. The scale of China&apos;s potential investment in urban resilience means that the rest of the world will be able to learn from their experience. That said, mature economies have led the way until now. London built its very effective flood barrier in the 1970s. Despite recent events, New York has a resilience strategy based on its nine-step adaptation assessment process to minimise the impact of climate change. Rotterdam has set itself the ambition to achieve 100% resilience by 2025. We also see good practice in Singapore, Copenhagen and elsewhere. But we do also see that legacy cities, in particular, often struggle to achieve best practice. And one challenge they face is how to combine resilience with social, environmental and economic sustainability \u2013 or as the Chinese would put it, harmonious urbanisation. I would argue that there are four key approaches cities should consider as a part of their efforts to combine resilience, sustainability and livability: \u2022 City governments should assume leadership to fully realise the value of resource efficiency, advanced technologies and solutions. That will result in an integrated master plan, which involves co-operation from various departments and agencies within government. The Rotterdam climate proof strategy, for example, comes under the direct responsibility of the mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb. \u2022 Technological advancement. Take Boston, which responded to the recurrent problem of snow-buried fire hydrants delaying fire fighters in emergencies. The city developed an adopt a hydrant phone app that allows people to take photos of their community fire hydrants, name them and maintain them voluntarily.The app has gone viral. \u2022 Cities should align partnerships with various stakeholders to explore effective collaboration models. We have worked with the Amsterdam Innovation Motor and the city&apos;s utility provider, Alliander, to build a co-operation model to accommodate potential carbon reduction solutions proposed by both the private and public sectors. That partnership resulted in more than a dozen pilot projects deployed in two years. In Japan, Accenture and six other companies partnered with the Yokohama city government to build a collaborative intelligent city, which last year won the first Barcelona Smart City Award. There are now 31 corporate partners involved. \u2022 Cities should take a value-driven approach to infrastructure development and technology deployment. Technology is not an end in itself. The citizen&apos;s user experience must be at the heart of thinking. That&apos;s why it&apos;s important to invite creative app developers in to exploit public sector assets and data to create user friendly apps and services. I tend to look at many things through a Chinese lens these days. Here we expect 300 million people to move to cities in the next 15 years alone. In some ways, these cities have a relatively blank slate to get resilience right. The sheer challenge of coping with explosive growth gives the Chinese a unique approach to urban sustainability. But the more complex efforts of long standing mature market cities can teach Chinese cities lessons in improvisation, navigating constraints and accommodating the sensitivities of multiple interest groups. Both Beijing and New York have suffered similar natural disasters in the last few months. We are likely to make most progress by learning from each other.

The manager has no plans to sell Lescott in the January transfer window and the 30-year-old is still considered an important member of his squad. Lescott was not included in the 18 player match-day squad by Mancini for Wednesday evening&apos;s 2-0 win at Wigan Athletic, with Kolo Tour\u00e9 preferred as the substitute central defender.

On my visit they had all three Westvleteren Trappist beers in stock (some of the rarest and reportedly best beers in the world) and I was able to try all for the first time.

Why? Because, as this fly-on-the-wall series reveals, everything at the hotel has to be perfect. It takes days of work, for example, to transform an entire floor to a temporary palace for foreign royals who haven&apos;t even confirmed their stay. Sharp questions from behind the camera and humour prick the how-to-spend-it bubble. General manager Thomas Kochs on the perils of jotting a note to U2&apos;s guitarist: &quot;You can&apos;t write, &apos;Dear Mr The Edge\u2026&apos;&quot; JW The Real Man&apos;s Road Trip: Sean And Jon Go West9pm, Channel 4 More amusing culture-clash frolics as liberal city-slicker-type comedians Sean Lock and Jon Richardson travel to the US state of Louisiana in the first of a two-parter hanging out with Creole cowboys in the bayou. Among their chores are to herd cattle, journey across alligator-infested swamps and castrate a bullock. All of which is a particular challenge to Richardson, whose vegetarianism is a source of amused perplexion to the locals. DS The Fear10pm, Channel 4 Something is unsettling criminal kingpin Richie Beckett, but then he has a lot to be unsettled about. Maintaining a veneer of self-restraint that made him a respected \u2013 if feared - member of the Brighton business community isn&apos;t easy when his sons drag him into a face-off with east European pretenders to his crown. Richie&apos;s irascible side soon bubbles up, despite a desire to keep the peace. Peter Mullan puts in a performance that could easily be Walter White&apos;s Caledonian cousin, in a convincingly uncompromising crime drama. Continues throughout the week. MJ Junior Doctors: One Year Check Up9pm, BBC3 If you watched the original Junior Doctors, you might be forgiven for thinking some of the Chelsea and Westminster trainee medics couldn&apos;t cure their way out of a paper bag. But one year on they&apos;re all grownup. Andy, who couldn&apos;t get a canula in, is plunging veins like a natural and Priya, who had the air of a woman who&apos;d already been a doctor for 10 years, is off to dermatology. Aki sums their first few weeks up with frightening honesty. &quot;It was a nightmare,&quot; he sighs. &quot;I feel a million times more confident now.&quot; HV Ottolenghi&apos;s Mediterranean Feast9pm, More4 Yotam Ottolenghi&apos;s journey through the Med concludes this week in his homeland of Israel, the place where his obsession with food began. He finds fabulous produce in Tel Aviv and experiences seafood with twist. He also wades into hummus, and discovers how a visually unappealing chickpea goo conquered the globe. Then it&apos;s on to making shashuka \u2013 a quintessentially Mediterranean dish of eggs poached in a spicy tomato and hot pepper sauce \u2013 before heading off to pick fresh pomegranates, easily the most glamorous fruit on the planet. A fitting conclusion to his journey. BA Grimm9pm, Watch Granger, a Wesen (the human/monster hybrids only visible to Grimms) goes on the run with his daughter, leaving his estranged wife lying bloody and beaten at home. With a trail of battered bodies in his wake as he and his offspring attempt to outrun child services and Grimm justice, Granger&apos;s seems a cut-and-dried case. But that isn&apos;t quite so. While the main story is a deceptively standard one, there&apos;s more pleasure to be had from Nick finally taking Hank to his secret trailer full of helpful information on monsters, as well as the weaponry to deal with them. PO&apos;N  Tuesday Last Tango In Halifax9pm, BBC1     Anne Reid (Celia) and Derek Jacobi (Alan) in Last Tango in Halifax. Photograph: Helen Turton/BBC/Red Productions/Helen Turton    Thankfully there&apos;s little opportunity for the reunited pensioners to get busy with the butter this week as their pesky families are all grabbing the screen time. Caroline has ditched John, but he refuses to leave the house and indulges in some decadent behaviour while listening to The Archers. Gillian has problems, too, as Raff gets a police caution for beating up Paul. And what of Alan and Celia? Well, they&apos;ve obviously been busy as Celia wants to overshare the details of their love life with a reluctant Caroline, and a lack of church attendance threatens to scupper their wedding plans. HV Body Of Proof9pm, Channel 5 Is this show about a police medical examiner who is also a mum, or is it about a mum who is also a police medical examiner? This week it&apos;s tipped towards the latter as Dr Megan Hunt&apos;s private life eclipses everything else. Good news on the dating front is soured when she hears her ex is moving away and taking their daughter along. While this makes things a bit more soapy than usual, it&apos;s just as well as the case-of-the-week \u2013 a teenager found dead after a rave \u2013 isn&apos;t much of a poser. PO&apos;N Imagine: Jeanette Winterson \u2013 My Monster And Me10.35pm, BBC1 &quot;It was very difficult not to get things wrong,&quot; says Jeanette Winterson of growing up with her mother, a woman who &quot;spoke like the Bible&quot; and wanted her adopted daughter to be a missionary. Which, the author reflects, she might be, albeit someone proselytising on behalf of literature. Here the Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit writer&apos;s honesty and &quot;combative energy&quot; shine through as she takes Alan Yentob to her childhood home, and discusses a suicide attempt and her search for her birth mother. JW The Dark Ages: An Age Of Light9pm, BBC4 The word &quot;barbarian&quot;, says Waldemar Januszczak, has its roots in a Greek term for someone who spoke a foreign language, rather than a marauding pagan. It&apos;s a counter-intuitive starting point for a debunking of what we think we know about the Huns, Vandals and Goths. Each of these tribes left behind stunning works of art as they spread out across Europe and, in the case of the Vandals, north Africa. Camden resident Januszczak delights in the irony of the original Goths being &quot;colourful, inventive&quot; people rather than black-clad gloom-mongers. JW Why Poverty? The Great Land Rush10pm, BBC4 Part of BBC4&apos;s Why Poverty? season. Hugo Berkeley and Osvalde Lewat&apos;s film notes that after a period of stability, food prices spiked at the beginning of the 21st century. They look for reasons why in Mali. Mali is poor, with a wealth of agricultural land. This has attracted foreign investors, who have been buying land from beneath the feet of the 75% of its population who subsist from agriculture. A scheme to lease farmland aims to please everybody \u2013 but faces difficulties in figuring out who owns it in the first place. AM Alphas10pm, 5* US superhuman crime squad serial, now in its second season. Hoping to foil supervillain Stanton Parish&apos;s doomsday plot, Cameron and Kat respond to a telekinetic tip-off, and stumble across Mitchell (Hobbit Sean Austin), an Alpha able to store the memories of others. Can the pair get him back to base before Parish&apos;s goon gets to them? Meanwhile, Dr Rosen, the Xavier to Parish&apos;s Magneto, shows his ruthless side when a memory-wiped senator starts asking tough questions. Enjoyable, briskly paced fluff, with enough moral complexity at its core to keep things interesting. GM  Wednesday The War On Britain&apos;s Roads9pm, BBC1 More and more cyclists are taking to the roads, competing for space with four-wheeled traffic \u2013\u00a0with prickly and often perilous consequences. This documentary sees both sides of the conflict, using footage from helmet-mounted cameras now used by cyclists as documentation of their near-collisions with irresponsible drivers. We see also some of the liberties taken by red-light jumping cyclists, and hear from those involved in road rage incidents. A well-made film, if a little high on adrenaline and drama rather than information. DS The Town9pm, ITV1     The Town (ITV) Photograph: Big Talk Productions    A few years ago ITV promised to build an empire around the talents of Martin Clunes, but no one quite envisaged something as spooky as The Town, in which Clunes features as the dishevelled, often drunk mayor. Renton is the town&apos;s name, and the vibe here is decidedly unsettling: amid the calm of the semi-detached houses, there&apos;s the humming of sinister business. When an unexpected turn of events causes the not exactly un-weird Mark (Andrew Scott) to return to his hometown, he finds nothing, eerily, has really changed. A bit too stylish and odd to fit with the channel&apos;s other output, but an intriguing story, nonetheless. JR Chris Tarrant&apos;s Extreme Railways9pm, Channel 5 In this first of a new series, Chris Tarrant travels to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to experience the oft-ramshackle rail network running through the spine of the nation. Viewers not in possession of thick glasses and sturdy notebooks can rest easy: the programme delves more into the culture and history alongside each route rather than poring over, say, the benefits of broad-gauge tracks, while Tarrant remains engagingly game throughout. MJ Rome: A History Of The Eternal City9pm, BBC4 First part of Simon Sebag Montefiore&apos;s attempt to do in two episodes what took Edward Gibbon several volumes. In this instalment, he unspools the irony that Rome owes its status as a monotheistic holy city to its pre-Christian history as the habitat of a vast, unruly pantheon. As Montefiore demonstrates, these gods were consulted \u2013 and sacrificed to \u2013 on every major subject: no wonder so many Roman emperors sought to join their number. AM Nation&apos;s Best Am Dram9pm, Sky Arts 1 Tonight it&apos;s the battle of the Bard. All four remaining companies perform the eye-gouging scene from King Lear at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford. A web designer playing Gloucester meekly gainsays his director about the excessive violence in her blocking. Another man intends to play Lear&apos;s Poor Tom as a junkie complete with Calpol syringe. Judges Miriam, Bill and Quentin squabble entertainingly as per and it all adds up to another hour of superbly gripping viewing. JNR The Office: An American Workplace10pm, Comedy Central The show is still dragging out Michael&apos;s farewell; tonight his replacement, Deangelo Vickers, arrives. So the old boss has to sit and watch all his loyal underlings try to impress (suck up to) the new guy. It&apos;s more a hindrance than a help that Vickers is played by Will Ferrell; he goes full-tilt in his performance, which is seldom advisable. Seeing the regulars debase themselves in front of him isn&apos;t much fun either, Jim and Pam pimping their baby&apos;s cuteness, Kevin wearing a wig. Thankfully the show is saved by Andy who is mistaken for the office buffoon and desperately has to assume that role. PO&apos;N  Thursday Great Continental Railway Journeys9pm, BBC2     Michael Portillo presents Great Continental Railway Journeys. Photograph: Steve Peskett/BBC/Boundless Productions/Steve Peskett    Ever clutching a copy of George Bradshaw&apos;s 1913 Continental Railway Guide close to his pastel attire, Michael Portillo concludes his retro trip around Europe with journeys through Holland, Belgium and France. Amsterdam&apos;s central station, he discovers, was built on reclaimed land. In Brussels, he makes friends by handing out praline chocolates. Portillo&apos;s odyssey ends in the forest of Compi\u00e8gne, where the 1918 armistice was signed, and where, in a Foch-off gesture, Hitler later forced the French to concede defeat in 1940. JW Madeley Meets The Squatters9pm, ITV1 It is what it says it is: a documentary in which Richard Madeley sets off to talk to squatters, in the wake of the new law criminalising the squatting of residential property. It might be tempting to conclude that ITV is commissioning by plucking the names of presenters from one hat and the topic from another, but Madeley acquits himself rather well, honestly acknowledging his own wealth and (possibly not coincidental) reflexive distaste for squatting, yet giving those who do it (and those who suffer it) a compassionate hearing. AM Jamie &amp; Jimmy&apos;s Food Fight Club9pm, Channel 4 Caffeine-addled toddlers Jamie Oliver and Jimmy Doherty are out to prove that Brit cuisine is the best. So they&apos;ve decamped to a &quot;pop-up cafe&quot; in Brighton where each week they&apos;ll do battle with foreigners over a particular foodstuff (this week they take on the French at cheese-making). Well, that&apos;s the premise. In reality this is a largely formless affair; one minute Oliver and Doherty are sprinting around a town centre dressed as farm animals, the next they&apos;re challenging Alan Carr to a game of Sausage Roll Russian Roulette. Exhausting. GM The Secret Life Of Rubbish9pm, BBC4 In the 70s and 80s, the stuff we threw away didn&apos;t just reflect the times we were living in, it dictated the whole political agenda. The piles of uncollected rubbish left rotting in the streets during the &quot;winter of discontent&quot; led to refuse collection becoming the first of our public services to be sold off under Thatcher. So part two of this stealthily brilliant BBC4 doc is not just a load of rubbish, it&apos;s about privatisation and environmentalism \u2013 two concepts that weren&apos;t always in opposition, as the bloke who invented the bottle bank cheerily testifies. SJR Playhouse Presents: A Young Doctor&apos;s Notebook9pm, Sky Arts 1           Set in Russia in 1917 and based on the short stories of Mikhail Bulgakov, this might seem like a bleak prospect but far from it; starring Daniel Radcliffe as a doctor working in a small village at the start of the revolution and Jon Hamm as his older self in the Stalin era, this is very funny indeed in its bleakly provincial way, with echoes of The Irish RM and Blackadder. &quot;We have a lot of fun round here,&quot; one of Radcliffe&apos;s new colleagues promises him on arrival. &quot;Only last month I heard a very amusing anecdote.&quot; Take his word for it. DS Europe&apos;s Forgotten Desert9pm, Nat Geo Wild The Tabernas Desert in southern Spain is the only desert in Europe, with far more in common with Africa than the Costas. The ancient former seabed is the parched home to scorpions, reptiles and vegetation somehow thriving in drought. A landscape without human habitation, it is arid and mountainous, nicknamed &quot;the Badlands&quot;, and not without reason. Plants and animals have learned to cope with the scarce rainfall, which comes in the form of infrequent but dramatic deluges. Scenery such as this is a gift to photograph and document, as evidenced here. BA  Friday North Pole Ice Airport8pm, Channel 5 Fans of John Carpenter&apos;s The Thing may experience a jolt of deja-vu at the start of this documentary, in which a helicopter crew flies over the icy wastes, searching for something very particular. In fact, these Russians are looking for the perfect site on which to build, of all things, an airport, just 25 miles from the North Pole, with a runway &quot;like no other in the world&quot;. This new series follows the construction of Ice Station Barneo, and follows its prospective guests (scientists, adventurers, tourists), braving temperatures of -40 C. AJC Westminster Abbey9pm, BBC2     Ptolemy Dean in Westminster Abbey (BBC2). Photograph: BBC/Kate Scholefield    Sweeping cameras herald this new series going behind the scenes at Westminster Abbey: &quot;a flagship institution, right at the centre of public life&quot; as the Abbey&apos;s master of the choristers James O&apos;Donnell says. In this first episode, we meet the dean, the vergers and plumbers&apos; assistants responsible for the smooth running of this self-contained indoor city, approximately 1,000-years-old. If there&apos;s a beatific calmness and quiet majesty about the place, it&apos;s made abundantly clear that it takes superhuman levels of unflustered planning to keep it that way. AJC. Peter Kay\u2013 In Conversation9pm, Channel 4 Whatever you think of Peter Kay&apos;s catchphrase-y schtick, the man has a particular genius for getting the most out of a relatively slim portfolio of material. Here then is a timely bit of self-promotion for Kay&apos;s new standup DVD \u2013 itself cobbled together from the same run of shows as last year&apos;s Tour That Didn&apos;t Tour Tour release \u2013 as the Boltonian comedian chats about a career that only the churlish would deny has been hugely successful. Danny Baker, making a welcome return to our screens, asks the questions. GM Spy8.30pm, Sky1 Tim is invited to the summer ball at Marcus&apos;s school but his ongoing datelessness prompts cruel taunts from Portis and the other spies in the office. Meanwhile, Phillip is ousted from the school in Mrs Godfrey&apos;s own night of the long knives while her daughter Bernice coldly swats away the boyish advances of Chris. Mathew Baynton as Chris steals this episode when he fashions his feelings of rejection into an impressive musical missile and aims it straight at Bernice&apos;s head. Silly and brilliant. Silliant. JNR AC/DC Live At River Plate9pm, BBC4 There are few things more cringe-worthy in rock than a musician mangling the native language of the audience they&apos;re playing to, in some misplaced attempt at bonding. Brian Johnson doesn&apos;t even try. &quot;We don&apos;t speak very good Spanish,&quot; he growls at 200,000 Argentinian fans. &quot;But we speak rock&apos;n&apos;roll pretty good!&quot; He&apos;s not wrong. Recorded in Buenos Aires in 2009, there&apos;s a whole lotta classics here, from Back In Black to Highway To Hell and For Those About To Rock (We Salute You). Play it quietly while sipping a herbal infusion, just to confuse people. AJC Rattlesnake Republic9pm, Animal Planet How many ways can you catch a rattlesnake? Loads, if this documentary which follows Texas types with massive beards &apos;n&apos; bellies hunting them down for cash is anything to go by. Those rattlers love &quot;cracks, crevices and critters&quot;, and there&apos;s a price on their heads. Of course, danger lurks everywhere: lazy apprentice Dalton gets frisked by a snake while he takes a rest on a rock; showman Jackie \u2013 bitten 10 times \u2013 is reaching for the anti-venom again; and young guns Danny and Jase are dicing with death. It&apos;s like a land-locked Deadliest Catch, but more rattly.

The launch of the Open Data Institute (ODI) on Tuesday 4 December is the antithesis to that view. Founded by the creator of the world-wide-web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel Shadbolt, professor of computer science at the University of Southampton, the institute aims to unlock enterprise and social value from the vast amount of open government data made available by the public services reform agenda. We have to facilitate supply by providing &quot;plumbing-like&quot; processes and technology standards, says Gavin Starks, chair of the ODI. &quot;Second, we need to make sure they are used. This means training people on what open data means, how to use it, and why it is valuable. Finally, we need to demonstrate value, nurturing organisations, new and old, to deliver positive change.&quot; User demand has grown since the establishment of an Open Data Institute was announced in the Chancellor&apos;s autumn statement in 2011. Accountancy firm Deloitte found that between January 2010 and September 2012, demand for open data on data.gov.uk, measured by the average number of page views for each dataset, has grown by 285%.  But David Rhind and Hugh Neffendorf, members of the government&apos;s advisory panel on public sector information (Appsi) argue that we need a more strategic approach to how public sector information should be reused.  Indeed, &quot;our latest guide to public spending has been the hardest to get the information for - ever&quot;, says Simon Rogers, editor of The Guardian Datablog and Datastore. Inaccessible PDFs, incomparable data and departments that have failed to file their spending reports by the July deadline are just some of the inherent flaws, he says. However, Starks is honest about a &quot;culture of experimentation, to explore and discover what works, what is useful, what is surprising, and what may lead to unexpected results&quot;, being nurtured by the ODI. Our live online discussion with cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, which takes place between 12pm-1pm on Tuesday 04 December, aims to establish how the Open Data Institute will benefit users and policy making in practice. We want to know: \u2022 How the ODI will &quot;unlock&quot; relevant, quality data at scale and how its effectiveness will be measured? \u2022 How does the ODI define &quot;useful&quot; and &quot;valuable&quot; data? \u2022 What the ODI&apos;s approach to anonymised, confidential data will be? \u2022 Is there a shortage of the information management and analytical skills needed to maximise the benefits of open data and should we regard data science as a key management discipline? \u2022 Should government seek to generate revenue from licensing and add value to raw data? What data should remain freely available? \u2022 Why is it so hard to get a breakdown of public spending?  Expert panel Sir Jeremy Heywood is cabinet secretary for the British civil service.

His crime was one of which countless thousands of people could now be guilty: squatting. A 21-year-old from Plymouth, Haigh was arrested for living in a house in Pimlico that had been empty for over a year. He had come to London seeking work as a bricklayer; now he has a criminal record. When section 144, which makes it an offence to squat in a residential building in England and Wales, came into effect at the beginning of September, many people agreed with it, including 52% of Guardian readers in an online poll. But is squatting really a menace or a burden to society? Might it even be beneficial? And when we talk about squatting, what do we really mean anyway? Those questions are raised again this week, albeit belatedly, by a surprising new adjudicator: Richard Madeley. In Madeley Meets The Squatters, the former breakfast TV maestro turns investigative reporter, visiting squatters and anti-squatters alike, and bringing more nuance to the subject than the current administration did when it drafted section 144. Grant Shapps, co-chair of the Conservative party, has a very clear idea of what squatters are: they are people who come and steal your home while you are on holiday. Justifying the law change in this paper, Shapps cited some well-publicised recent incidents of homes stolen by squatters, including that of Oliver Cockerell, a Harley Street doctor, which was occupied during renovation work while his wife was pregnant. Dr Cockerell blamed &quot;gangs of anarchists and eastern Europeans&quot;. Shapps went on to describe squats as &quot;death traps of despair&quot; and spoke of squatters&apos; lives as &quot;characterised by gloom and anguish&quot;. &quot;The gentle and romantic image of communal harmony and a counter-cultural lifestyle is an illusion,&quot; he declared. These negative stories have dismayed many long-term squatters. Take Joe Blake and Reuben Taylor, two squatters in their 20s who live in an abandoned plant nursery near Heathrow airport. Their set-up, Grow Heathrow, is far closer to Shapps&apos; illusory harmonious community than a death trap of despair. In fact, you could call it a squat-topia. Blake and Taylor&apos;s group \u2013 now numbering 17 or so \u2013 cleared their site of 30 tonnes of waste and repaired derelict greenhouses to live in. They grow organic vegetables, which they sell via the local grocer. They hold bicycle workshops, arts and crafts sessions and gardening workshops for the local community. They even do the gardening for the local constituency office. They have displaced no one and the neighbourhood wants them there, since they campaign against the proposed third runway. It&apos;s a frugal existence, mind you. The only electricity is via a wind turbine and solar panels \u2013 just enough for music and the internet. It gets bitterly cold in winter. The &quot;shower&quot; is a Heath Robinson-like contraption consisting of a water butt on top of some scaffolding, with pipes leading to an old radiator with a fire underneath it. &quot;We&apos;re building a roof for it so we don&apos;t get rained on while we&apos;re showering,&quot; says Blake. It would be very difficult to paint these squatters as a burden to society. They don&apos;t even have a carbon footprint.     Grow Heathrow was set up in an abandoned plant nursery near the airport. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian.    Blake and Taylor are also members of Squatters&apos; Action for Secure Homes, or Squash, a voluntary group that has been leading the campaign against section 144. Most of the governments&apos; arguments for criminalising squatting they can instantly rebut. They say the well-publicised examples of squatters stealing people&apos;s homes represent an insignificant proportion of the estimated 20,000 to 50,000 people squatting in the UK, most of whom live in long-term abandoned properties (the government has done no research of its own since 1986). Last month, 160 experts on housing law wrote an open letter complaining that &quot;media and politicians are misleading about law on squatters&quot; and that the existing law was adequate to protect homeowners like Cockerell. In the government&apos;s own consultation last year, 96% of respondents agreed that the law did not need changing, including most homeless charities, the Metropolitan Police, the Criminal Bar Association and the Law Society. &quot;They completely overplayed it,&quot; says Blake over a cup of tea in Grow Heathrow&apos;s greenhouse kitchen. Shapps and co whipped up a moral panic, aided by sections of the media, then section 144 was &quot;sneaked&quot; through parliament during the bill&apos;s last three days, he says. &quot;Squatters aren&apos;t very well represented in the media, so you just hear these horror stories in the papers. But most squatters want to stay somewhere for a long time. They don&apos;t want to take someone else&apos;s home.&quot; &quot;What you don&apos;t get is the story about the pregnant squatter who&apos;s kicked out on the street,&quot; adds Taylor. &quot;Many squatters are homeless and vulnerable.&quot; &quot;From our point of view,&quot; Blake continues, &quot;the only people this law protects are property speculators and unscrupulous landlords who are keeping properties empty.&quot;     'They're not mafias. They are law-abiding citizens, workers' ... squatters in the Dharavi slum in Mumbai. Photograph: Bethany Clarke/Getty Images    Moral panic over squatting is not difficult to engineer, says Dr Hans Pruijt of the Erasmus University, Rotterdam, who has studied squatting across Europe. In the Netherlands, a country with a formerly enlightened squatting tradition, it was outlawed in October 2010, by a very similar process to the UK. In Spain, in the mid-1990s, squatting was tenuously linked to terrorism before being outlawed. It is invariably rightwing governments that push through the laws, Dr Pruijt observes, often on the basis of spurious arguments. &quot;I think it&apos;s part of a revanchist mood in politics,&quot; he says. &quot;Everything that people hate is blamed on soft, leftwing politics from the 1960s and 70s \u2013 migration, squatting, Muslims. So it&apos;s revenge against what happened in the past.&quot; Pruijt has identified five basic reasons why people squat: out of deprivation and an immediate need for shelter; as a strategy for pursuing an alternative lifestyle (often by the middle classes); for entrepreneurial reasons, such as setting up a community centre or small business; for conservation reasons; and what he calls &quot;political squatting&quot; \u2013 as an arena for confrontation with the state. The categories often overlap, as with Grow Heathrow, but none of them are intrinsically harmful to society, Pruijt says. Some forms of squatting are demonstrably beneficial. In Dutch there is a word krakers \u2013 literally &quot;crackers&quot; \u2013 to describe the type of constructive squatter who fixes up damaged buildings. &quot;Squatters quietly restore house&quot; is a story that rarely makes the papers, although in the 70s in Amsterdam, hundreds of squatters moved into and repaired dilapidated buildings in the historic Nieuwmarkt area, and fought to save the neighbourhood from large-scale demolition and redevelopment. It was the beginning of a successful conservation movement in the city. Furthermore, squatters are often involved in activities that bring little financial reward but are often beneficial, Pruijt points out, such as music or art or community projects. In the UK that category now includes teaching, nursing and studying at university. Some would say all squatting was political, though. Property equals power, and squatting has been historically linked with the struggle of the dispossessed, anti-establishment movements, and the control of space. The practice is as old as the notion of property itself. The origins of &quot;squatters&apos; rights&quot; lie in the ancient, unwritten law that if you could erect a dwelling overnight on a piece of land, it had the right to stay there \u2013 similar laws can be found around the world. As such, squatting was one of the processes by which European and even American cities grew, as makeshift settlements became permanent communities, which were often then appropriated by landowners and replaced with something more profitable. Particularly talismanic in the political context was Gerrard Winstanley and his Diggers, who provoked a wave of shortlived Christian communes in the 1640s. Winstanley questioned the very foundations of property ownership, and the class structure that resulted from it. Those sentiments run through the major postwar squatting movements: communist, anarchist, hippie, environmental. As a student, I squatted for three years in the early 1990s in the Leytonstone area of east London. Even in the halcyon days of student grants, London was expensive and squatting was a cheap option \u2013 with countercultural credentials to compensate for the lack of glamour, or hygiene. But there was also a political slant: this was along the route of the proposed M11 link road, which became a flashpoint in the movement against the conservative government&apos;s road-building agenda \u2013 as personified by celebrity crusty Swampy. We were getting a free place to live, but we were also fighting against the destruction of the community. Events came to a head on my former street, Claremont Road, which became the last, stubborn stronghold against eviction. In December 1994 (when I no longer lived there), it took several hundred police officers several days to remove the non-violent squatter-protesters. The appropriation of space is still a protest tactic, as shown by the Occupy movement today, but their gestures are largely symbolic forms of squatting rather than a long-term strategy.

Photograph: Glenn Copus/Associated Newspapers/Rex Features    But if squatting is on the retreat in Europe, it has exploded in the rest of the world. According to a recent UN estimate, some 800 to 900 million people around the world are technically squatters \u2013 over 10% of the world&apos;s population. The socio-economic conditions are different: these are overwhelmingly rural migrants settling on the outskirts of cities. But these are still people occupying land they do not own, without permission. Questions of whether or not squatting benefits society are redundant here; squatting is society. In Mumbai, India, for example, slum-dwellers represent roughly 60% of the population. In Turkish cities, it is roughly 50%, Brazilian cities, 20%. These squat neighbourhoods are often referred to as slums, shanty towns, favelas or bidonvilles. They are often characterised as grim places, with poor sanitation, high crime rates, drug gangs, and other problems. But it&apos;s often a misconception, says Robert Neuwirth, author of Shadow Cities: A Billion Squatters. He spent two years living in slums in four of the world&apos;s largest cities: Mumbai, Nairobi, Istanbul and Rio de Janeiro. &quot;They&apos;re not criminal enterprises. They&apos;re not mafias,&quot; he says. &quot;These are people, law-abiding citizens, workers. People who wait on the tables and clean the rooms in the tourist hotels. People help each other and take care of each other. These were wonderful places to live, once you step beyond the fact that they don&apos;t have a sewer system.&quot; In many cases, slum squatters are literally second-class citizens, with no power to improve their neighbourhood, and vulnerable to exploitation. In Rio de Janeiro for example, favelas are being razed in preparation for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. But in other cases temporary dwellings have evolved into more permanent neighbourhoods, just as they did in pre-industrial Europe. Rio&apos;s Rocinha district, for example, is technically a favela but is no longer recognisable as such; it has multi-storey concrete dwellings, plumbing and electricity. &quot;Where they can, you find people rebuilding their homes over 20 or 30 years, one wall at a time,&quot; says Neuwirth. &quot;From mud to cardboard, to wood, to brick, to reinforced concrete, as they save.&quot;     The 'vertical slum' ... Torre David in Caracas is a 45-storey tower block that houses some 2,500 squatters. Photograph: Daniel Schwartz/Urban-Think Tank    Is this entirely different to the European understanding of squatting? For one thing, the two are beginning to overlap. In the centre of Caracas, for example, stands the Torre David, a 45-storey bank tower that was abandoned halfway through construction. It is now home to some 2,500 squatters, who moved in, completed the building and divided its spaces using found materials. It has been called a &quot;vertical slum&quot; \u2013 with its own shops, amenities, water and electricity (there are still no lifts). In the broader sense, what ties together these disparate instances of squatting is human beings&apos; capacity to organise and provide for themselves. &quot;Wherever you go in the developing world, and, I would argue with most of the squatters in the UK and the US, you&apos;re talking about a notable act of self reliance by people facing a system that does not provide housing they can afford,&quot; says Neuwirth. &quot;This is something we should be saluting, rather than looking at it as some kind of horrific, criminal approach.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s the basic paradigm of our time: we shouldn&apos;t trust so much in the state. We shouldn&apos;t trust so much in big companies, we should take responsibility ourselves,&quot; says Pruijt. &quot;Squatters have pioneered this.&quot; It is difficult to see how outlawing squatting will benefit the British taxpayer. Squash predicts section 144 will cost the public purse an extra \u00a3790m in the first five years, due to greater demands on homeless rehabilitation, housing benefit and other government services. Plus police resources diverted to protecting properties and evicting squatters, and judicial resources diverted to processing and convicting them. &quot;The legal aid bill was supposed to be a cost-cutting bill, but this one clause will wipe out the entire expected saving,&quot; says Blake. One phenomenon that has taken hold in Holland that&apos;s likely to come our way is anti-squatting \u2013 in which a handful of occupants are officially permitted to occupy an empty property, thereby preventing real squatters moving in. Anti-squatters usually pay a nominal rent, but forfeit basic property rights: prospective buyers can visit at any time and they can be evicted at a moment&apos;s notice. So technically, anti-squatters are second-class citizens, not far removed from developing-world slum-dwellers. Still, that&apos;s a better option than the alternative housing strategy the coalition is offering Alex Haigh: prison.     The Rocinha favela in Rio de Janeiro ... squatters have installed plumbing and electricity. Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty Images)    What the squatting dispute boils down to is a split between those who consider private property to be sacred, and those who would prioritise the right to shelter. Few people would happily forfeit a second home to squatters, but nor does it feel morally justifiable for a nation to have an estimated 930,000 empty homes while people sleep on the streets. &quot;We&apos;re facing one of the worst housing crises we&apos;ve ever faced,&quot; says Blake. &quot;They&apos;re cutting housing benefits, cutting provision to homeless charities, there&apos;s massive youth unemployment and property prices are unaffordable.&quot; Those conditions are not likely to change any time soon. Nor do continual promises of new, affordable homes look likely to bear fruit in the near future. Grow Heathrow is safe for the time being, since section 144 only applies to residential properties, but they are in no doubt the law will be extended to include commercial properties, including their community. Like all long-term squatters, they are now wondering how long they have got before they are thrown out and reclassified as criminals. Shapps&apos; proclamation that squatters&apos; lives were &quot;characterised by gloom and anguish&quot; now looks more like a self-fulfilling prophesy. &quot;People are really scared at the moment,&quot; says Reuben Taylor. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of fear and anxiety. Some people will end up on the streets, some will end up on housing benefits, some will find other places to stay, and some might go to jail. It&apos;s a big unknown.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;Squatters quietly restore house&quot; is a story that rarely makes the papers, although in the 70s in Amsterdam, hundreds of squatters moved into and repaired dilapidated buildings in the historic Nieuwmarkt area, and fought to save the neighbourhood from large-scale demolition and redevelopment."], "title": "'Squatters are not home stealers'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/dec/03/squatters-criminalised-not-home-stealers", "tags": ["Squatting", "Housing", "Communities", "Homelessness", "Social exclusion", "Law", "Society", "Brazil", "Americas", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-04T16:03:43Z", "article": "&apos;HE&apos;S THE FACE ON THE RADIO&apos; The Fiver has never followed fashion, preferring instead to lead the way, safe in the certainty that one day the world will catch up, that ridicule is nothing to be scared of, and that in the fullness of time the Fiver&apos;s daring fusion of Marks and Spencer Blue Harbour knitwear, mid-fawn parallel-leg catalogue slacks and daring Michael Portillo-style oily-walnut-whip hairstyle will be considered the height of hipster chic.

Wenger, of course, is something of an authority on this subject, having spent the last few years pioneering the high-fashion full-length rain-sodden puffa gown, a coat that starts from the basic proviso that whatever else happens out there having slightly cold knees must be avoided at all costs, and which constructs its polyester-mix fashion cathedral on top of this single unflinching principle. The Fiver, incidentally, can produce definitive evidence of the fashion ascent of the Wenger-gown after noticing this week that the exact same coat is now worn by the woman who walks around near the train station down the hill from the Fiver&apos;s house demanding that passers-by give her money to help feed what is clearly a non-existent baby, even on occasion exposing to the passing traffic a single allegedly lactating side of her chest in the hope of extracting further funds by this method. When even lactating milk-scam woman can be seen wearing the Wenger-gown, when it is this same floor-length quilted robe that is being yanked apart at the chest to extort small change from passers-by, it is safe to say the Arsenal manager&apos;s own sartorial triumph is complete. &quot;It&apos;s fashionable to be against Arsenal,&quot; Wenger told the assorted dandies of the red-faced sherry-stinking press pack in Greece. &quot;We live in a world that needs a drama every day.

But the Dutch capital may lose its\u00a0reputation for tolerance over plans to dispatch nuisance neighbours to &quot;scum villages&quot; made from shipping containers. The mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, insists his controversial new \u00a3810,000 policy to tackle antisocial behaviour is to protect victims of abuse and homophobia from harassment. The camps where antisocial tenants will be rehoused for three to six months have been called &quot;scum villages&quot; because the policy echoes proposals from Geert Wilders, the far-right populist, who last year demanded that &quot;repeat offenders&quot; be &quot;sent to a\u00a0village for scum&quot;. But Bartho Boer, a spokesman for the mayor, denies that the plans are illiberal. &quot;We want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam,&quot; he says. &quot;We want everyone to be who he and she is \u2013 whether they are gay and lesbian or stand up to violence and are then victims of\u00a0harassment. We as a society want to defend them.&quot; According to Boer, the villages are not for &quot;the regular nuisance between two neighbours where one has the stereo too loud on Saturday night&quot; but &quot;people who\u00a0are extremely violent and intimidating and in a clear situation where a victim is being repeatedly harassed&quot;. Those deemed guilty of causing &quot;extreme havoc&quot; will be evicted and placed in temporary homes of a &quot;basic&quot; nature, including converted shipping containers in industrial areas of the city. &quot;We\u00a0call it a living container,&quot; says Boer. Housing antisocial tenants in these units, which have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation, will ensure that they are not &quot;rewarded&quot; by being relocated to better accommodation. Dutch newspaper the Parool has pointed out that in the 19th century troublemakers were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which rapidly became slums. But Boer insists that the administration has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to house the antisocial together. It would be more accurate to call them &quot;scum houses&quot; than scum villages, says Boer, &quot;because we don&apos;t want to put more than one of these families in the same area&quot;. After up to six months in these houses, scattered around the city, the tenants will be found permanent homes. The city government anticipates moving around 10 families a year into this programme, which starts in 2013. The temporary dwellings will be heavily policed, but antisocial tenants will also have access to doctors, social workers and parole officers. &quot;They are taken care of so the whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in,&quot; says Boer.", "sentences": ["Amsterdam still looks liberal to tourists, who were recently assured by the Labour mayor that the city&apos;s marijuana-selling coffee shops would stay open despite a new national law tackling drug tourism.", "&quot;We want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam,&quot; he says."], "title": "Liberal Amsterdam plans to create 'scum villages'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2012/dec/04/liberal-amsterdam-plans-scum-villages", "tags": ["Netherlands", "Europe", "World news", "Housing", "Communities", "Society", "Cities"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-05T00:02:00Z", "article": "     Roberto Mancini denied feeling embarrassed after Manchester City ended their European campaign with the lowest points tally of any English team in Champions League history \u2013 but admitted his side have a &quot;big problem&quot; scoring goals. Julian Schieber&apos;s 57th-minute winner for Borussia Dortmund also ensured City, who failed to qualify for the Europa League after finishing bottom of Group D, became the first English side not to win a single group stage game. Even the Blackburn side of 1995-96, hitherto regarded as representing the nadir of English incompetence in Europe&apos;s premier club competition, managed four points. City ended up with three. &quot;You can&apos;t be embarrassed when you play 100%,&quot; said Mancini, whose side have scored just four times in the past five games. &quot;I don&apos;t feel we lost our application but if you want to win games you have to score and at the moment we have this big problem. When we have a chance we don&apos;t convert it and we need to resolve this.&quot; Mancini also insisted that Group D was a proper league of champions, with the Spanish, German and Dutch winners having to fight it out like cats in a sack, and that his side had been unlucky in key moments. &quot;There were four teams in our group that could win a Champions League, and we made some mistakes in the opening few games and we didn&apos;t get time to recover,&quot; he said. &quot;We were ahead against Real Madrid in our first game and we were 1-0 up in Amsterdam and had two or three chances to score another but we paid for not taking our chances.&quot; Mancini, however, claimed that morale would not be a problem ahead of the Manchester derby on Sunday, adding: &quot;We didn&apos;t lose the Champions League on the night and we have five days to recover our strength.&quot; However a despondent Joe Hart offered a more downbeat assessment of City&apos;s performance, questioning whether his team-mates had lost their spirit after they went behind. &quot;I think it was there but then they score and it disappeared,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve not qualified, we&apos;ve not even got in the Europa League,&quot; he added. &quot;We wanted a win and we&apos;ve let ourselves down. We wanted to do it and if that meant Europa League then great. We&apos;ve only got ourselves to blame.&quot; Mancini is not certain that failing to qualify for the Europa League will provide an advantage in the title race over United, who remain in the Champions League. &quot;It could be because we don&apos;t play Thursday but we play a team like United who are used to playing Champions League every year,&quot; he said. &quot;It depends on us I think.&quot; There were words of encouragement for City from the Borussia Dortmund manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who pointed out that his side were knocked out in the first round of the Champions League last year. &quot;I&apos;m still very impressed by the quality that Manchester City have in their team but tactically we could minimise their threats,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a very good team.

Three points, no wins, muted performances and an alarming lack of know-how marked a path to bottom place in Group D. Even Europa League football \u2013 the &quot;prize&quot; for finishing third of four teams \u2013 was beyond reach. This goes down as the most dire English performance in the group stages of the continent&apos;s elite competition. The nadir of Blackburn Rovers in 1995-96, which featured the David Batty-Graeme Le Saux punch-up at Spartak Moscow, showed a final tally of four points and can now be replaced by City&apos;s humiliation. A phase that threw up the glory-soaked night of cash-strapped Celtic beating Barcelona 2-1 thanks to a late winner from an 18-year-old debutant, Tony Watt, had the \u00a31bn Sheikh Mansour project taught a lesson at every stop it limped into. City scored only seven times (two fewer than last year), lost 3-1 to a callow Ajax in Amsterdam, and ended a painful, six-game long capitulation by surrendering on Tuesday evening to a largely second-string Borussia Dortmund. The injured David Silva and Ga\u00ebl Clichy apart, plus the suspended Yaya Tour\u00e9, the XI sent out by Mancini, who cannot stop rotating strikers, was his strongest. For Dortmund, J\u00fcrgen Klopp fielded only five of the team that taught City a lesson in the earlier, reverse match between the two, as the captain, Sebastian Kehl, Sven Bender and Mario G\u00f6tze were injured and the star Polish trio of Lukasz Piszczek, Jakub Blaszczykowski and Robert Lewandowski were named only as substitutes. Dietmar Hamann, the former City midfielder who won the 2005 Champions League with Liverpool, summed up the disbelief at the performance that sealed City&apos;s exit from European football this season. &quot;The gulf looked very big,&quot; he told Sky Sports. &quot;Borussia rested some of their top players. The players who came in for City all cost a lot of money. The Borussia players didn&apos;t. I saw one team that had the will to win and one that didn&apos;t. If I didn&apos;t know beforehand what their position in the group was I would have thought that Borussia had something to play for and City didn&apos;t.&quot; As damning was the verdict of Ruud Gullit, a double European Cup winner with Milan: &quot;The manager takes the responsibility when you win and when you lose. If the intention was to get out of playing in the Europa League then they did a great job. If their intention was to win to get in to the Europa League then they made a fool of themselves. It was dreadful. There was no team at all. I didn&apos;t see anybody getting mad or angry or even looking like they wanted to do it. It was such a bad performance. Even though they didn&apos;t want to play in the Europa League, at least they could have made an effort. At least do something. &quot;They bought a lot of players for their name. I don&apos;t think they bought players for other reasons. I don&apos;t see the reason they bought Maicon. Maybe someone can tell me that. They had some good players and they sold them.&quot; In last season&apos;s Champions League bow City gathered 10 points, scored nine times and returned two victories to finish behind Napoli and Bayern Munich. Then, Mancini&apos;s mantra was that 10 points is usually enough to progress, and that lessons would be learned, the experience drawn on. Yet the alarm again sounded as early as the end of this term&apos;s opener at Real Madrid. 87th and 90th minute goals from Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo turned a 2-1 win into a morale sapping loss for City. &quot;Mancini said after one defeat that he knew what the problem was and he would fix it,&quot; Gullit added. &quot;That&apos;s what he said. I have not seen that he has fixed it. I just see them playing worse and worse.&quot; From Madrid, Mancini&apos;s men sleepwalked through the stage. Two weeks later, Mario Balotelli&apos;s late penalty salvaged a point at the Etihad after Dortmund&apos;s slick passing and clever technique took City apart. Then came the debacle at Ajax despite Samir Nasri giving City a 22nd-minute lead, when lax defending and foggy-minded attacking allowed Frank de Boer&apos;s band to win at a canter, 3-1. In the return, the Dutch champions were 2-0 up after only 17 minutes before goals from Tour\u00e9 and Sergio Ag\u00fcero salvaged a point. That made it only one managed from the six on offer against the group&apos;s weakest team. Ultimately, this return cost Mancini&apos;s gang the chance to retain hope of progressing into the final two matches as the Italian faced the indignity of having Jos\u00e9 Mourinho bring his side to the Etihad in late November with City virtually out and watch the man who may replace him one day oversee the 1-1 draw that finally killed any mathematical chance. Of this, Mourinho laughed and said: &quot;If it was Real Madrid the press wouldn&apos;t let me return to Madrid.&quot; At the Westfalenstadion on Tuesday Mancini claimed he was not embarrassed by City&apos;s failure. He added: &quot;Dortmund went out in the group stage last season, and were fourth. But this season they can win it in my opinion. When you start and make mistakes, like we did in the first two or three games, you cannot recover.&quot; Football&apos;s ruthlessness means Mancini will be lucky to get the chance to make it third time lucky next season.", "sentences": ["City scored only seven times (two fewer than last year), lost 3-1 to a callow Ajax in Amsterdam, and ended a painful, six-game long capitulation by surrendering on Tuesday evening to a largely second-string Borussia Dortmund."], "title": "Manchester City's Champions League campaign is new top English flop | Jamie Jackson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/dec/05/manchester-city-champions-league", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-06T12:18:00Z", "article": "Electric City, the 2012 edition of LSE Cities&apos; conference series, takes place today and tomorrow at the London School of Economics and Deutsche Bank&apos;s Alfred Herrhausen Society. This year&apos;s event is focusing on the different ways in which urban societies across the globe are being influenced by technological and environmental change. You can watch a live video feed from the conference here. The conference publication includes a wealth of detailed graphics covering topics including transport, energy consumption, pollution and urban planning, as well as a visualisation-rich case study on London. Below is a selection of the maps and charts on show, along with a summary of some of the most interesting patterns that emerge: Proximity to public transport     Proximity to rapid transit stations in selected cities, broken down by residential and commercial property. Click for larger image    Hong Kong&apos;s residents are the best-connected, with over 40% living within a 500m radius of a rapid transit station. The city also scores highest for commuting, with over half its places of work less than half a kilometre from a station. Stockholm scores second highest in both categories, while New York and London are third for residents and commuters respectively. Los Angeles scores lowest for each category, with less than 5% of its residents living within 500m of a station. How people travel     Methods of transport in selected cities. London has the highest proportion of trips made by car. Click for larger image    Of the six cities shown, London has the highest proportion of trips made by car, at 39.8%. Public transport accounts for 34% of journeys, while walking (23.7%), cycling (2%) and motorcycle trips (0.8%) make up the remainder. New York scores highest for public transport, with almost three in every five commuter trips made by taxi, bus, rail or metro. Hong Kong fares best for walking, with 44.7% of journeys made on foot. Copenhagen leads the way for cycling, with one in five trips powered by pedals. How cities change     Changes in measures including population, emissions and transport, shown for selected major cities across different continents and states of economic development. Click for larger image    Portland&apos;s CO2 emissions per capita have halved since 1993.Copenhagen&apos;s energy consumption per capita has fallen by around 20% since 1993, with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita dropping at a slightly faster rate. Singapore&apos;s population has risen steadily, and TransMilenio, its public transport system, has seen passenger numbers double since its 2001 launch. Despite its growing population, traffic incident fatalities have more than halved since the late 1990s. Cycling in Hong Kong has been booming in the last 20 years, and is one of the factors that have contributed to its falling CO2 emissions per capita.     Changes in measures including population, emissions and transport, shown for selected major cities across different continents and states of economic development. Click for larger image    Around the year 2000 London&apos;s technology sector really took off, and employment in the digital economy has increased by almost 50% since 1997. Taking inner East London as a standalone region, high tech employment has nearly doubled in 15 years. Mumbai&apos;s rapid population growth is symptomatic of nationwide trends, and has come at an environmental cost, with CO2 emissions per capita for India as a whole increasing at a faster rate than the port city&apos;s population. Peak electricity demand in Mumbai has also rocketed upwards, increasing by over 75% in ten years. Berlin&apos;s population has remained relatively constant since 1993, but a decreasing reliance on non-renewable energy across Germany as a whole has improved its environmental credentials. The capital&apos;s CO2 emissions per capita have dropped by over 30% in 18 years. Vehicle ownership in Sao Paulo is booming, but traffic speeds during evening rush hour have fallen since 1993, suggesting its road network is struggling to cope with congestion. Unpacking London: energy &amp; pollution     Data on energy and pollution in London, mapped and analysed over time. Click for larger image    Three quarters of London&apos;s energy consumption is fueled directly by oil and gas, with the vast majority of the remainder generated by fossil-fuel-powered electricity. Just 2.1% comes either direct from waste and renewables or from renewably-generated electricity. London&apos;s CO2 emissions per capita are higher than the world average, but lower than those of comparable developed cities New York and Portland, as well as Singapore. Landfill is gradually being phased out as a method of solid waste management, but still accounted for roughly one third of the total in 2011/12. Incineration and recycling/composting also make up around a third each. London&apos;s air contains more than 2.5 times as much NO2 than the EU standard - still slightly less than Paris - but is well below the EU&apos;s recommended ceiling for particulate matter. PM10 counts in Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam are all higher than that of London. NO2 levels closely follow London&apos;s road network, with Heathrow Airport and the M4 standing out as particularly high. Unpacking London: transport, tech and planning     Data on transport, planning and the digital economy in London, mapped and analysed over time. Click for larger image    Since 1993 car travel has decreased faster in London than across the UK as a whole, and average annual distance traveled per person in 2011 was roughly half of that for the country overall. Bus, tube and overground travel continues to grow, with distance traveled on public transport approaching the same level as car miles. Cycling has taken off in London, with the number of cyclists in the capital trebling since 1985, and overtaking that of both New York and Stockholm. Berlin remains ahead of London on this nominal measure, and at 13% has one of the highest proportions of cycle trips a share of all journeys. London&apos;s office space is well served by public transport links: almost 1m cubic metres was built between 2004 and 2011 within 500m of a station, with no new office construction more than 2km from a public transport hub. The City of London has seen more new office space than any other part of the capital, while the bulk of retail and leisure floorspace has gone to the Olympic Park and surrounding area. Shoreditch has the highest density of IT jobs in the city, followed by Holborn and parts of the City of London. Despite its strong performance in the digital economy, London has slower broadband speeds (both download and upload) than European neighbours including Berlin, Paris and Copenhagen, as well as Tokyo and Seoul, whose speeds are several times faster.

Michel Platini, the Uefa president, first revealed his plans for a pan-European tournament in June and Uefa&apos;s executive committee voted in favour at a meeting in Lausanne on Thursday. The Football Association has already put Wembley forward as a possible destination for the final and semi-finals, and Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland have the opportunity to host matches after previously expressing an interest in a joint bid for the 24-team event. Any decision on venues will not be made until the spring of 2014 and the bidding process will begin in March. It is understood that although the semi-finals and final will be played in the same city, they may be at three different grounds. David Bernstein, the FA chairman, recently said: &quot;Clearly Wembley is incredibly highly thought of by Uefa and it is something we will push for. Uefa want to hold the semi-finals and the final on the same ground, or in the same city and I think we would be on their shortlist \u2013 but there would be some strong competition.&quot; Platini has argued that at a time of economic uncertainty, Uefa does not want to burden a country without sufficient infrastructure. However, the decision has been met with fierce criticism in certain quarters. Mark Perryman, a spokesman for England fans&apos; groups, said: &quot;The issue is why on earth didn&apos;t England, or any other major country, bid to host 2020? Why didn&apos;t England try and step into the breach? Why didn&apos;t they launch pressure for the bid to be reopened. It seems extraordinary that a country like Germany, who haven&apos;t hosted a European Championship since 1988, or Italy, who haven&apos;t hosted it since 1980, didn&apos;t consider bidding for it. In terms of Germany and England, not a single new road or ground would need to be built. It seems incredible. &quot;If Platini is putting his foot down then Bernstein should be going public and saying &apos;why weren&apos;t we allowed to?&apos;&quot; He did argue, though, that travelling to different cities across Europe could be simpler than the arduous lengths supporters had to endure in Ukraine last summer. &quot;For England&apos;s group in the Ukraine, the travelling was more considerable than it would be, say, to play in Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels. That would actually be less travelling. It would be considerably cheaper and easier,&quot; Perryman said. Kevin Miles, the Football Supporters&apos; Federation director of international affairs, reiterated the concerns but revealed that Uefa has been in contact with fan groups across Europe. He said: &quot;We had a meeting with Uefa a couple of weeks ago to discuss the format in terms of where the group-stage games will be played, making sure that those matches are held close to each other. England&apos;s group games will be closer together than they were at the last Euros when they were split between Donetsk and Kiev. Uefa are aware of the issues and they did stress to us that it&apos;s a one-off.&quot; Euro 2020 will be the first major football tournament to span more than two countries. Belgium and the Netherlands were co-hosts of the European Championship in 2000, Switzerland and Austria did Euro 2008 and Poland and Ukraine combined last summer. Japan and South Korea came together for the 2002 World Cup. Georgia and Azerbaijan had made formal bids for 2020, in addition to interest from the Celtic nations. Wembley could face competition from Scotland for the final, although Glasgow may bid only to host group-stage matches. The Scottish Football Association chief executive, Stewart Regan, said: &quot;As something different and innovative, it does carry a lot of merit. We would be interested in the final but we first have to find out Uefa&apos;s minimum criteria for capacity \u2013 if they are looking for stadiums with greater capacity then of course we would be interested in hosting group matches.&quot; Jonathan Ford, the chief executive of the Football Association of Wales, said: &quot;This rules us very much in. We now have to see how this can work on a logistical basis. If we are part of a hub including Glasgow, Dublin and an English city this could be very exciting. What we don&apos;t want is fans having to travel from Rome, to Istanbul and then to Lisbon. Uefa will have to be very clever in their selection. We&apos;ve got to think of fans first and foremost.&quot; Uefa also ruled that ownership of players by a third party in Europe &quot;should be prohibited as a matter of principle&quot;. It said in a statement: &quot;Fifa will be requested to issue relevant worldwide regulations prohibiting third-party ownership of players. Uefa, through its Professional Football Strategy Council, would also be ready to implement a regulatory framework to prohibit third-party ownership arrangements in Uefa competitions, should Fifa not take the appropriate steps.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;For England&apos;s group in the Ukraine, the travelling was more considerable than it would be, say, to play in Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels."], "title": "Euro 2020 to be hosted across Europe, Uefa announces", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/06/euro-2020-across-europe-uefa", "tags": ["Uefa", "Football", "Michel Platini", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-07T09:43:02Z", "article": "1) Marco Boogers and his caravan You might have heard of Harry Redknapp. New manager of Queens Park Rangers. Almost got the England job. Not a fahkin&apos; wheeler-dealer. Redknapp famously bristles at suggestions he is just a crafty cockney, a reputation largely stemming from his days as West Ham&apos;s manager, when punts on the likes of Paolo Di Canio and Trevor Sinclair, and cut-price deals for John Hartson and Paul Kitson, were handsomely rewarded by some fine performances. Yet while he enjoyed success in some of his transfer dealings at Upton Park, they were rivalled by the failures. The \u00a318m received from Leeds for Rio Ferdinand was frittered away on no-hopers and Titi Camara. There was the curious case of Gary Charles or the time Redknapp claimed Florin Raducioiu went shopping at Harvey Nichols with his wife instead of turning up for a League Cup tie away to Stockport, which West Ham lost thanks to a storming own goal from Iain Dowie. But none could match the oddity that was Marco Boogers&apos; brief but eventful spell in east London. Boogers arrived at West Ham in the summer of 1995 for \u00a31m from Sparta Rotterdam, having built up a perfectly acceptable reputation in the Dutch league, but it would later emerge that Redknapp had never seen him play, instead relying on a video of the striker. That in itself is not so strange \u2013 Redknapp was hardly the first manager to rely on a tape \u2013 but it did him no favours when things took a turn for the worse. This being the days before Twitter, YouTube and European football experts, supporters had no idea what to expect and Boogers made his debut on the opening day of the season as a second-half substitute in a 2-1 home defeat by Leeds. He made little impact. But not to worry. He was in a foreign land. Plenty of time to make his name. As it turned out, his next appearance off the bench a few days later would be rather more eventful. West Ham were trailing Manchester United 2-1 when Boogers was thrown on with the minutes ticking away. He did not take long to make his mark \u2013 on Gary Neville, that is. Shortly after coming on, Boogers flew through the air and fulfilled many a Liverpool fan&apos;s lifelong dream, taking Neville out with what the Sun called a &quot;sickening horror tackle&quot;. Thankfully, Neville was not hurt and finished the match but Boogers was immediately sent off and given a four-match ban for his recklessness. That should have been that but Boogers, affected by the media attention and suffering from homesickness, went back to Holland. Again, nothing remarkable about that. Foreign player visits own country shock! He was not the last West Ham player to do so, after all. In 1998 the Chile defender Javier Margas played three games in England before going awol for a year; he returned the following season and showed his commitment to the cause by dyeing his hair claret and blue. For Boogers, though, a simple trip home turned into one of the strangest stories in English football as it was reported that &quot;Barmy Boogers&quot;, as one paper put it, had gone to live on a caravan site in Holland. West Ham had signed a nutcase. A nutcase off a video tape. West Ham&apos;s managing director, Peter Storrie, was forced to deny rumours that Boogers had been deemed &quot;mentally unfit&quot; to play in September 1995. &quot;We had our meeting in the Hilton hotel at Amsterdam,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&apos;t see a caravan, or a tent for that matter. He is certainly not mentally unstable. It is absolute nonsense.&quot; Storrie was telling the truth because the story had stemmed from a misunderstanding between a member of staff at West Ham and a journalist and snowballed from there. Strangest of all, the club employee, Bill Prosser, cleared the story up in a letter to the Fiver in 2005:  &quot;Here&apos;s a stitch-up of a work colleague, albeit an accidental one. In the 90s I was the PA announcer at Upton Park. I also handled all of the club&apos;s travel arrangements. You will remember that Marco Boogers famously went a bit doolally shortly after joining the club and was reported to be living in a caravan in Holland. Although this was 10 years ago, it is often quoted as fact to this day. Unfortunately it is untrue and it is my fault.  &quot;Marco was depressed after being sent off in his second appearance for West Ham at Old Trafford and disappeared for a few days. West Ham&apos;s Clubcall reporter phoned me and said he was trying to find Boogers for an interview but could not reach him. He asked if I had booked any flights for him.  &quot;I told him I hadn&apos;t, but added: &apos;If he has gone back to Holland, he&apos;s probably gone by car again.&apos; The reporter misheard me and stated on Clubcall that I had said: &apos;If he&apos;s gone back to Holland, he&apos;s probably gone to his caravan.&apos; As you know, journalists often listen to Clubcall. Which explains why, the following day, the back page headline in the Sun was: &apos;Barmy Boogers Living In A Caravan&apos;. The legend endures \u2026 I feel a bit responsible for his misfortune.&quot;  Boogers made only two more appearances for West Ham and, after suffering a knee injury, he returned to the Dutch league in February 1996. It is easy to laugh now but, as Redknapp admitted, West Ham did not handle the situation especially well. This was the start of English football&apos;s foreign revolution and perhaps there was not enough care for foreign players, which has changed now. All of which still did not stop Redknapp from naming Boogers as his worst ever signing at West Ham. At least he kept Sandra out of it. Jacob Steinberg 2) Pfaffing about Your country is at the World Cup and has just reached the second round, thanks mainly to a fine victory over Argentina. The obvious thing to do, as the tournament enters its latter stages, is drop your goalkeeper, who is commonly regarded as one of the best in the world. Right? Well that&apos;s what Belgium did in 1982 and, if you consult summaries of the tournament, you&apos;ll see that the odd reason usually given for the sudden demotion of Jean-Marie Pfaff is that the manager Guy Thys was punishing the goalkeeper for pretending to drown in the hotel swimming pool. So far, so petty. But there was a little more to it than that, though pettiness remains a prominent driver of the story. Pfaff arrived at the World Cup having just sealed a transfer from Beveren to Bayern Munich. His reputation was growing but his popularity with national team-mates was not. His perceived cockiness irritated them. While in Spain for the World Cup, the Belgium management arranged a poolside bash at the team&apos;s hotel to which the country&apos;s media were invited. The country&apos;s best-known radio commentator, Jan Wauters, was there and, being a close friend of Thys, he felt sufficiently at ease to play a merry prank: so he crept up behind Pfaff and pushed him into the pool. &quot;Hehehe!&quot; went the revellers \u2026 until a problem became apparent: the goalkeeper couldn&apos;t swim. After being rescued, Pfaff was furious, with the players and with the manager, whose buddy went unreprimanded. When the press later asked Pfaff about his near-drowning, he played it down and said he had been only pretending to be in distress. Ill-feeling undoubtedly remained, however, and led to certain interpretations being put on subsequent events. In the 62nd minute of the last group game, against Hungary, Pfaff came to cut out a cross and inadvertently clobbered his captain, Eric Gerets. The full-back, who lay motionless on the pitch for about a minute before he was eventually substituted. An ambulance was called. It did not arrive until after the match and when the concussed Gerets was taken to it, there was no room for him \u2026 because Pfaff had got there first, complaining of a shoulder injury. Off sped the ambulance without Gerets, leaving the aggrieved captain and his chums outraged. Pfaff&apos;s wound turned out to be only minor but resentment towards him was major. Thys chose to leave him out for the next match and picked Theo Custers instead. Belgium were beaten 3-0 by Poland but rather than recall Pfaff for the make-or-break clash with the USSR, Thys turned to his third-choice keeper, Jacques Munaron. Belgium lost 1-0. Gone were their hopes of making a big splash in the tournament. Paul Doyle 3) For Steve Ogrizovic&apos;s eyes only With its moles, sleeper agents, intelligence, counterintelligence, top-secret files protected by impenetrable encryption codes and electronic surveillance, the clandestine world of espionage is not one you would readily associate with famous footballers. Despite Ryan Giggs&apos;s urbane sophistication, rugged good looks and smouldering sex appeal, he is unlikely ever to be considered as a replacement for James Bond should the MI6 agent decide to hang up his Walther PPK. The Manchester United midfielder&apos;s well-documented attempt to keep a secret couldn&apos;t have been less successful if he&apos;d personally called every house in the UK and told the occupants exactly what it was he didn&apos;t want them to know. Of course it&apos;s a sweeping generalisation to suggest that, just because one might not necessarily trust West Ham&apos;s striker Andy Carroll to successfully pull off a clich\u00e9d park-bench briefcase swap with a Russian counterpart, it is inconceivable a professional footballer might one day be considered to work for the secret service. However, one can&apos;t help but feel that if the current head of MI6, Sir Robert Sawers, was looking to recruit somebody from the professional ranks to investigate a shadowy crime syndicate run by an evil cat-stroking megalomaniac, the former Coventry City goalkeeper Steve Ogrizovic would hardly be the first port of call, even if he was a notoriously safe pair of hands. Younger readers may not be familiar with the man they call Oggy, an aesthetically challenged former policeman and FA Cup-winning Coventry legend who had a famously crooked nose, made 507 appearances between the sticks for the Sky Blues between 1984 and 2000 and most recently made headlines when he was forced to confirm that, contrary to speculation that he&apos;d been thrown in jail by the Kazakhstani government on suspicion of spying, he was in fact safe and well on the sovereign soil of his native England. According to a petition posted on www.petitiononline.com in 2003, Ogrizovic had been travelling the world using only public transport in an attempt to raise money for a charity called Over The Bar, which was devoted to helping young goalkeepers develop their skills as athletes. On his way through Kazakhstan, the petition informed readers, the unfortunate Ogrizovic had accidentally trespassed on to private military land, resulting in the hapless tourist&apos;s incarceration. &quot;The British embassy has contacted the Kazakhstani government but nothing has come of this,&quot; wrote the author of the Free Steve Ogrizovic appeal. &quot;Here is our petition to Tony Blair and the Kazakhstani government demanding the release of footballing legend Steve Ogrizovic and protesting his innocence.&quot; Anyone in doubt of Oggy&apos;s popularity among Coventry City supporters was quickly set straight when a whopping total of just under 300 people flocked to sign the petition calling on Kazakhstan to release their hero, a number that, in the intervening nine years, has mushroomed to more than 700. &quot;Please free Steve as he&apos;s a bent-nosed hero to millions,&quot; implored one signatory. &quot;He&apos;s obviously innocent and this is no way for a rubbish goalkeeper to have to spend his time,&quot; wrote another. A reporter from the Coventry Evening Telegraph, detecting the whiff of rodent in the air, becoming suspicious of the story of Ogrizovic&apos;s internment and using the kind of dogged investigative techniques for which the names of the Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein have long been synonymous, eventually managed to discover that the then academy director wasn&apos;t in fact languishing in a Kazakhstani cooler, by going to the club&apos;s Ryton training ground \u2026 and asking him. &quot;This is a complete hoax,&quot; said a slightly surprised Ogrizovic, upon being told of his plight. &quot;I haven&apos;t a clue where it has come from. I haven&apos;t made any trips to Kazakhstan lately \u2013 nor am I planning to. I can only assume that with the well-documented breakthroughs in science of late, I have obviously been cloned.&quot; While Oggy&apos;s good humour in the face of such a bizarre and potentially upsetting story is to be commended, it is perhaps worth noting that although he emphatically denied ever having set foot in Kazakhstan, to this day he has never said he isn&apos;t a spy. Barry Glendenning 4) Bernie Slaven&apos;s canine quandary &quot;There was an explosion of green,&quot; said David O&apos;Leary, remembering the reaction to his winning penalty for the Republic of Ireland against Romania at the 1990 World Cup. It put them through to the quarter-finals, where they would meet Italy. &quot;The biggest mistake was standing still. I nearly got killed by all my team-mates.&quot; Only one of them might have meant to do any harm: the substitute Bernie Slaven, who had spent the whole of the tournament on the bench. &quot;I basically trained for six weeks with a group of fringe players,&quot; Slaven told the Glasgow Evening Times in 2003. He was pleased to be there, but didn&apos;t hold out much hope of playing. &quot;We called ourselves the Muppets.&quot; By the time Ireland reached the knockout stages, Slaven had had enough. He wanted to get home to his dogs. &quot;I became a figure of fun when I called home on that trip,&quot; he recalled. &quot;While others were speaking to their wives, I would go on the phone and say: &apos;Put the dog on.&apos;&quot; The Middlesbrough forward was taking his dog for a walk when he found out he&apos;d been called up to Ireland&apos;s World Cup squad, and once left Ayresome Park at half-time to take the dog out, after being substituted. &quot;I could see the floodlights and hear the crowd from where I was walking, which was surreal,&quot; he said. Not quite as surreal as the picture that Tony Cascarino, Slaven&apos;s World Cup room-mate, paints in his autobiography. &quot;I&apos;d be sitting in the bed alongside and Bernie would be howling like Lassie into the phone: &apos;Woof, woof, aru, aru, woof!&apos; He&apos;d be kissing the receiver and lavishing affection \u2013 &apos;Hello, lovey dovey&apos; \u2013 on a dog! The first time it happened, I nearly wet myself.&quot; &quot;The reason was simple,&quot; Slaven explained, trying to save everybody a change of underwear. &quot;I got more sense out of her.&quot; Unfortunately his canine chum couldn&apos;t get her chops around the words &quot;Brian Deane&quot; or &quot;Neville brothers mare&quot; to warn Bernie off betting that Boro wouldn&apos;t beat Manchester United at Old Trafford in December 1998. Georgina Turner 5) A snappy idea There are a few ways to stop pitch invasions: electric fences, a heavy police presence, or making your team so bad that no fans turn up to run on the field in the first place. But the Romanian fourth division is a rough and ready place. Back in 2003, Steaua Nicolae Balcescu had been threatened with expulsion from the league after a series of pitch invasions and clashes. Steaua&apos;s chairman, Alexandra Cringus, perhaps showing why the team he was running were in the fourth division rather than the first, decided the best way to stop the hooligans was by building a crocodile-infested moat around the pitch. Because if you can&apos;t build a crocodile-infested moat around the pitch, what&apos;s the point in being in charge of a football club, eh? &quot;This is not a joke,&quot; insisted Cringus. &quot;We can get crocodiles easy enough and feed them on meat from the local abattoir. The ditch is planned to be wide enough that no one could manage to jump over it. Anyone who attempted to do so would have to deal with the crocs. I think that the problem of fans running on to the pitch will be solved once and for all.&quot; This wasn&apos;t some slapdash plan, though. Cringus had had a good long think about health and safety too: he planned to build the moat far enough from the pitch that players wouldn&apos;t accidentally tumble to their doom. He even thought of the crocs too: Romanian winters can be harsh so the water would be heated by electric pipes. You may not be surprised to discover that local authorities rejected the scheme. Tom Lutz 6) Sechsy time with Franz A different kind of receiver trouble now: remember the fun you had in German classes at school, when it came time to learn to count to 10? Eins, zwei, drei, vier, f\u00fcnf \u2026 sechs \u2013 ho ho! You said sex! Days of fun. So imagine the hilarity in 2004, when Franz Beckenbauer decided to take o2 up on the offer of a personalised phone number and chose 0176 (the usual prefix for chat lines) 666666. Hundreds of men apparently started calling Beckenbauer looking for sechsy times \u2013 enough to make a Kaiser pine for the days when &quot;Sepp&quot; would show up on screen as the phone shrilled into action.

At first glance, the proposal on the part of Amsterdam&apos;s Labour council to dump antisocial tenants in &quot;scum villages&quot; made out of shipping containers is the sort of thing that Policy Exchange might think up to get the Mail cheering and liberals worrying \u2013 you could imagine Michael Howard thinking it a potentially useful idea during his tenure as Tory leader. It also suggests an even more extreme version of Britain&apos;s vicious housing politics, the cleared estates, the evictions of rioters and their families. Yet it is being seriously proposed and very possibly implemented by a social democratic local authority. We could think also of the Swedish free schools that became Michael Gove&apos;s unlikely example for the future of education, or Grant Shapps&apos; enthusiasm for the elective get-up-and-go of Dutch self-build housing as a possible solution to our housing crisis. Somehow, the parts of northern Europe that the centre-left used to hold up as exemplars of more egalitarian, tolerant and productive societies are providing even more extreme blueprints for disciplining, excluding and generally putting the squeeze upon the undeserving poor. In his essay Ill Fares the Land, the late historian Tony Judt argued that the northern European welfare state still represented an alternative to the neoliberal model embraced by the US and the UK. The standard of living was higher, the Gini coefficient lower, the housing better and the population, it would seem, happier and less neurotic. Judt claimed that the social contract, worked out between capital and labour after 1945, continued to have a real presence in France, Germany, the Low Countries and Scandinavia \u2013 and a viable future should start from there. A visit to any of these places can still have a startling effect if you&apos;ve spent too long in dear, miserable Blighty. There are far fewer signs of poverty, not every surface is slathered with advertising and CCTV, not every high street is divided between chain stores and dereliction and things like social housing, that were abandoned here decades ago, are still getting built. A city such as Rotterdam, Aarhus or Hamburg visibly works far better than a British equivalent like Liverpool, Portsmouth or Glasgow \u2013 even getting round them is easier, given their integrated, usually publicly owned transport systems. Regeneration projects, such as Hamburg&apos;s vast HafenCity, are infinitely better built, more sensitively designed and more cohesively planned than direct equivalents like Salford Quays or Edinburgh Harbour. That immediate impression hides the fact that the same interests are being served. The average German provincial city&apos;s regeneration project will have better built, more spacious housing with a U-Bahn line running underneath, but it will still be aimed at a better class of resident. Improbably, the UK, at least until the crash of 2008, was often held up as a sexily dynamic, high-growth alternative to staid old Europe. So in Berlin the squats are evicted, in Denmark public housing is privatised, and in the Netherlands a real estate boom capsized the economy as much as in the UK \u2013 in fact, the Dutch even went so far as to privatise their trains, with the predictable effect of massively unreliable timetables, chaotic upgrade programmes and price rises. Welfare benefits are under attack everywhere, although admittedly starting from a stronger position. It would seem there&apos;s a central problem with Judt&apos;s otherwise admirable work. Northern Europe might still sometimes practise a form of social democracy, but its social democratic parties are nearly as eviscerated, morally bankrupt and tired as New Labour. Many social democratic parties in Europe have a distinctly Blair-like approach to triangulation \u2013 both to the left (with strong challengers like Die Linke in Germany and the Socialist party in the Netherlands) and the far right. New Labour is an obvious inspiration for Amsterdam&apos;s &quot;scum villages&quot; \u2013 here they would no doubt be called &quot;asbo estates&quot;. As with asbos, the behaviour that would lead to punishment in a scum container is not actually criminal \u2013 if it were, a real rather than &apos;&quot;pop-up&quot; prison would be the likely result. As with New Labour, it dresses up authoritarianism via reference to apparently cosy, consensual values \u2013 apparently the villages are only for people whose rudeness or violence disrupt Amsterdam&apos;s liberal norms \u2013 so that&apos;s all right then. What makes it all so depressing is that formerly social democratic Europe has so much to lose \u2013 more, in many ways, than we do. The same fight has to be fought, and refought. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 December 2012.

The Outsider, by Jonathan Wilson, is a forensic study of the position, the people who have played there and the intricacies of the role. The chapter about Thomas Nkono and Joseph-Antoine Bell, &quot;Tommy and JoJo&quot;, may\u00a0be of particular interest to Ferguson at a time when the Manchester United manager appears to be suffering from an unusual lack of\u00a0clarity. Nkono and Bell were rivals in the Cameroon team for almost two decades, and are probably the best African goalkeepers there have ever been. In different circumstances they would have been undisputed number ones in their own right. It was just their misfortune to come up against one another at the same time. Just as David de Gea and Anders Lindegaard are doing at United, they shared the role. Both men came to think it did nothing but confuse the team&apos;s defence. Peter Shilton and Ray Clemence used to think the same when Ron Greenwood was alternating them. On one occasion \u2013 England&apos;s 4-3 defeat in Austria in 1979 \u2013 Greenwood selected Shilton for the first half and Clemence for the second. Yet the policy did not take into account that a defence needs an understanding with its goalkeeper, and vice versa, and that for this position \u2013 perhaps more than any other on the pitch \u2013 there is clear sense in nominating a regular first-choice and sticking with him. The bottom line is, goalkeeper rotation does not work. It probably speaks for itself that there are so few other examples (C\u00e9sar S\u00e1nchez and the young Iker Casillas is one, though Real Madrid&apos;s coach, Vicente del Bosque, soon realised &quot;San Iker&quot; was the better option) at a time when Ferguson continues to swap around De Gea and Lindegaard while complaining he can barely remember United being so vulnerable defensively. There are not many times when Ferguson can be accused of sustained indecision, but this is one of them and the longer it goes on the more confusing it gets. De Gea played the first two games of the season but was dropped because of\u00a0a mistake against Fulham. Lindegaard came in for the next two and then they took turns, one after the other, for the following four games. De Gea was back for the next five, then Lindegaard for one, and then De Gea played three in a row before needing a wisdom tooth removing. Lindegaard kept his place for five games until De Gea was recalled for the match against Cluj on Wednesday. United, meanwhile, have conceded 33 goals in the various competitions and been derided by their manager for Cartoon Cavalcade defending. It is not an exact science, but it is difficult not to think the two things are\u00a0linked. The lesson of history is fairly clear. Of Ferguson&apos;s 12 titles, Peter Schmeichel played every game in 1992\u201193, missed two in 1993-94, 1995-96 and 1996\u201197, and four in 1998-99. Post\u2011Schmeichel, United struggled to fill the position, but Mark Bosnich still played 23 of the 38 league fixtures in 1999-2000, the year of Massimo Taibi. Fabien Barthez played 32 times the next season and 30 in 2002-03. Edwin van der Sar made 32, 29, 33 and\u00a033 appearances in his title-winning seasons. This is the pattern of just about every successful team. Petr Cech played in all but 11 games during three championships with Chelsea. Joe Hart did not miss a single match for Manchester City last season. How Ferguson must wish he had paid the \u00a3100,000 that Shrewsbury Town wanted for Hart a few years back. &quot;We all make mistakes,&quot; he says. That is not to say Hart has been flawless this season. In fact, broadening the argument, it has been a pretty undistinguished campaign so far for goalkeeping in the Premier League. Rob Green, Pepe Reina, Shay Given and Adam Federici have all, at one point of another, lost their places because of mistakes. If Southampton are trying to\u00a0work out why they have been in the relegation zone, the performances of Kelvin Davis, Artur Boruc and Paulo Gazzaniga represent Exhibit A. For Arsenal, Wojciech Szczesny and Vito Mannone have taken turns making supporters pine for the security of David Seaman. Tim Howard, Jussi Jaaskelainen, Mark Schwarzer, Simon Mignolet and Ali al-Habsi have all let in soft goals. It is a long list. Yet Ferguson is currently the only manager unable to decide on a first-choice and it is rare to see him this indecisive. Just as perplexing, there is little consistency. At the start of last season, when De Gea genuinely looked a danger to his own team, Ferguson persisted with him until a particularly bad run at Christmas. This season, one mistake and the Spaniard was out. The problem for Ferguson is that neither De Gea nor Lindegaard have an exceptional case. A few days ago I asked a former pro \u2013 a striker who studied goalkeepers for potential weaknesses \u2013 who he would choose. &quot;Neither,&quot; he replied. &quot;They&apos;re not good enough for Manchester United.&quot; Gary Neville seems unenthused, too, noting the goals his old club have conceded from set pieces and the absence of a goalkeeper dominating the penalty area. Neville knows what he is talking about. &quot;The defenders will be nervous about what&apos;s behind them,&quot; he\u00a0says. So who should it be? At a push, I&apos;d say De Gea would edge the kind of vote London&apos;s now defunct Evening News held in 1978, when it asked 22 players whom they would choose for England: Shilton or Clemence? Nine voted for Shilton and two for Clemence, one being his Liverpool team-mate David Johnson. Eleven could not decide. De Gea has, after all, shown flashes of brilliance and, though far from perfect, who would expect him to be, just a month after he turned 22? His potential is considerable and it would be a poor judge who could not see it. It is just that it is the manager after Ferguson \u2013 or maybe even further down the line \u2013 who will probably see it realised on a more consistent basis. For now, De Gea has been lucky United have had enough firepower over the past couple of seasons to ensure the goals conceded from his mistakes have not cost the team more points. Equally, however, it was always going to be the case that a new player, in a new country, would make errors. Overall, he has done about as well as could be expected since that bruising crash-course two autumns ago. It is easy, in fact, to feel a little sorry for him. It cannot be helping his confidence that his manager keeps playing football&apos;s equivalent of musical chairs. More than anything, it disrupts the team. Goalkeepers are different. This is the point Bell and Nkono make. Nkono, for example, always wanted a man on each post at set pieces, whereas Bell left them free. Bell liked to sweep up behind his defence, allowing them to play a higher line. With Nkono, the back four had to drop deeper. It was the same for Shilton and Clemence. Shilton hung back, Clemence moved forward. Shilton always wanted the area in front of him to be free, whereas Clemence liked the defenders nearer to him. Subtle yet important differences. De Gea, talented yet erratic, and Lindegaard, steady but not a man for the outstanding save, have their own styles. Together, they have been part of a team that are top of the league. Ultimately, though, the policy isn&apos;t working. Just look at United&apos;s goals-against column, 10 worse than City&apos;s. What is most surprising is that a manager of Ferguson&apos;s normally clear judgment is involved. He says it is because he has confidence in both goalkeepers. The impression it actually leaves is that he does not have total confidence in either. 2020 vision needed to see benefits of Platini&apos;s Euro expansion Never meet your heroes,&quot; they say. In this job it is not possible, but the phrase did come to mind in the summer, when I was sitting in a Michel Platini press conference in Kiev,\u00a0listening to him spring the idea of his multi-country Euro 2020 and wincing inside at his attempts to win over his audience. The low point was when a Ukraine journalist wanted to know what he had made of the country and its ability to host a major tournament. &quot;I&apos;ve drunk a lot of vodka,&quot; was the response. Someone else asked how he expected supporters to afford a tournament played in 32 different cities. &quot;There are budget airlines,&quot; he replied. But it was the shrug that was telling. The body language said one thing: deal with it. We know now that Uefa are going through with it and Platini&apos;s stock is so low these days it is not surprising so many people suspect one of the great figures in the history of the European Championship is going be the same guy who takes a sledgehammer to the\u00a0competition. Forgive me, however, for not being totally closed off to the idea. Yes, there are concerns. One of the beauties about a major competition is being at the hub of it, rather than dashing from one airport to another \u2013 and a semi-final or final in a city that has not been involved before that point might feel a strange, dislocated experience. There is the cost factor, too. Some news for you, Michel: even the sticky-carpet airlines stick a few hundred quid on when there are football fans to fleece. Yet, with a bit of common sense and organisation, it is surely possible to devise a system whereby Europe is split into sections. A group stage in, say, Amsterdam, Brussels, Manchester and Paris should be no more complicated to navigate than it was in Poland and Ukraine in the summer. The question is whether we can trust Platini and his colleagues to get it right. The wrecking ball here is surely not the\u00a0location, or locations, but the fact Uefa are expanding the competition from 16 to 24 teams. Now that truly is a dreadful idea. Making a hash of it Spare a thought for Jamie O&apos;Hara, the Wolves midfielder, who has closed down his Twitter account because of the reaction when he complained about the hardships of his \u00a335,000-a-week lifestyle. &quot;Things were so much easier when I earned 100 pounds a week on wts #stress&quot; he posted last week. Accused of being out of touch, O&apos;Hara got worked up as he pointed out he had bills to pay just like everybody else. &quot;Thanks to my real fans on here,&quot; he said before the final goodbye. &quot;It&apos;s a shame there&apos;s too many a********.&quot; Twitter can be a cesspit sometimes \u2013 just try criticising a footballer for his racist abuse, see where it gets you \u2013 but he wasn&apos;t really making it easy for himself, was he?", "sentences": ["A group stage in, say, Amsterdam, Brussels, Manchester and Paris should be no more complicated to navigate than it was in Poland and Ukraine in the summer."], "title": "Sir Alex Ferguson needs to figure out that two into one won't go | Daniel Taylor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/dec/08/sir-alex-ferguson-manchester-united", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Sir Alex Ferguson", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-09T21:30:01Z", "article": "One would expect the high-power headlights of luxury car brand Porsche to be pretty good at startling deer and blinding other drivers. But according to rumours circulating in Amsterdam, their high-intensity discharge (HID) xenon lamps are good for cultivating cannabis too. At the last count, 35 sets of headlights have been reported stolen from Porsche Cayenne and Panamera models in the Dutch capital in recent months. Oddly, the rest of the country has so far\u00a0been unaffected. Motoring blogs have blamed this trend on marijuana farmers being unwilling to fork out for the expensive lighting systems needed to maximise their harvest. As well as producing the correct light-to-heat ratio for growing cannabis, the xenon bulbs are highly energy efficient. Even small-scale cannabis farms require vast amounts of electricity, which makes the bulbs attractive for rogue herbalists. But could Porsche really have inadvertently engineered such a useful piece of horticultural kit? One Dutch hydroponic expert, known only as Midnight Gardener, says it is possible. &quot;HID bulbs would work. We sell normal HID bulbs, but the xenon ones must have something extra. It must be kids, or people who are down and out. It makes the whole growing business look bad though.&quot;      Another factor could be that the lights are simply too easy to steal. Online CCTV footage from late October shows a young man taking less than a minute to flick out the bulbs from a Panamera parked right outside someone&apos;s house. Porsche, which is working on ways to make the thefts harder, points out that it is not only its vehicles getting parts pilfered; it says the desirability is for xenon lamps, rather than specifically Porsche lights. &quot;Obviously there are other brands being stolen too,&quot; says Hannie Steeman of Porsche Amsterdam, &quot;but we don&apos;t know why. The only thing I can say is it\u00a0that it&apos;s a really local thing. It&apos;s restricted to Amsterdam.&quot; Currently the most popular lights used for growing cannabis are high-pressure sodium bulbs, which produce the optimum intensity and lumens (a measure of visible light) for the plants to flourish. Lumens, explains Midnight Gardener, &quot;are what get you the big tomatoes&quot;. He has 12 years&apos; experience in the business, and the news has sparked his curiosity. &quot;I&apos;m going to have to do some research. Maybe these bulbs have a different intensity that&apos;s good for\u00a0growers. I&apos;ve actually got a\u00a0Porsche Cayenne out the front.

Never imagine nothing can be done: UK Uncut packs a punch far above its weight, as did the suffragettes, slave trade abolitionists and most causes great and small. A clever protest deftly done on the right issue can catch the public imagination and the media&apos;s attention: now the public accounts committee investigates and the government is obliged to pledge action. At Saturday&apos;s Starbucks occupation of 40 coffee shops, the point was easy to explain to passers-by: companies massively avoiding tax help to cause the cuts that shut libraries, Sure Starts and women&apos;s refuges. This short occupation with an orderly exit and loud chants causes Starbucks deep reputational damage. Costa, nearby, does pay its taxes, while Starbucks avoids its duty to the civilised society it depends on. Take note, all other corporate avoiders: Manchester Business School estimates that Starbucks will see a 24% drop in sales over the next year, from the experience of reputational crises in 50 other companies. The eye-popping stupidity of choosing this same week to cut its staff&apos;s paid lunch breaks and sickness and maternity pay suggests a company whose only efficiency is in tax-avoiding. The \u00a320m it offers as a &quot;donation&quot; to HMRC may even be tax deductible: it can offset this &quot;overpayment&quot; against future tax, once public attention has drifted elsewhere, adding to the phenomenal recent drop in corporation tax receipts, as companies copy one another&apos;s avoidance schemes. In 2009 the Guardian&apos;s tax gap series kicked off this debate, exposing devious but legal devices such the &quot;double Luxembourg&quot;, the &quot;Dutch sandwich&quot; and Roger the Dodger of Barclays. This is the most dangerous kind of investigation, where any mis-step risks lethal lawsuits from those with deep enough pockets to kill: it cost us \u00a3100,000 in lawyers&apos; fees alone, plus months of journalists&apos; time digging into opaque company accounts. We told how Boots, bought by private equity firm KKR, abandoned its Nottingham home to put its HQ in Zug, the Swiss tax haven. By loading the company with debt, its tax bill dropped from \u00a3606m to \u00a374m \u2013 and Barclays lent them billions to do it. GlaxoSmithKline and Astra Zeneca moved to Puerto Rico and Shell took its trademark to Switzerland. Diageo transferred brand names to a Dutch subsidiary, so Johnnie Walker whisky paid just 2% tax. How did they put the profits from a whisky blended in Kilmarnock into low-tax Amsterdam? Deloitte did it, reportedly so proud they broke open champagne when it went through. And that is the crux of the matter. At the heart of almost every tax-avoiding scheme is one of the big four accountancy firms \u2013 Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young. Tax campaigner Richard Murphy, whose razor-sharp work with the Tax Justice Network fuels so much of this campaign, says these four are at the heart of the worldwide web of avoidance, with offices in all the main tax havens. PwC explained on the radio last week that the reason it had large offices in Bermuda was to audit the local hospital. Few clients could use these havens without one of the big four as auditor: virtually no business happens in havens, but bankers, lawyers and accountants need to be located there. The four have a grip on the auditing of many major firms. The dogged work of accountancy professor Prem Sikka shows how they work, cold-calling to offer elaborate tax schemes. They hardly ever give bad audits to companies hiring them, and despite grave failures in auditing banks, they are not disciplined by professional accountancy bodies. Nor does the Treasury recover costs, even when successfully challenging their elaborate scams. The public accounts committee last week gave a satisfying roasting to three boutique tax-avoidance firms. Margaret Hodge tore a strip off them, as one admitted that all his schemes had been declared illegal and shut down. But now the committee needs to go after the big four: none of this could happen without them. In his autumn statement George Osborne declared \u2013 as chancellors always do \u2013 that he would pursue avoiders. But he replaced only a fraction of the Revenue&apos;s cuts, with another 10,000 staff still to be lost. If Osborne were serious, stern regulation could stop all this. As it is, companies that pay their auditors \u00a3700 an hour will sometimes undeservedly get a clean bill of health, as did Northern Rock, HBOS, Bear Stearns and the rest. One radical suggestion is that the National Audit Office should take charge of all big company auditing itself, paid by a levy according to company size: it would protect shareholders from inadequate audit and taxpayers from avoidance. Banks are still receiving clean audits, despite the governor of the Bank of England declaring them to be zombies paralysed by undeclared bad debt. So far attacks on tax avoidance focus on the web, but now it&apos;s time to go for the spiders that spin it. The same firms that conspire to deprive the state of revenues are paid large sums as consultants by the very government they weaken. KPMG, along with McKinsey, is conducting much of the sale of the NHS to private contractors. If you want to see this curious contradiction, look no further than PwC&apos;s website, which blends its contrary functions in one sentence: &quot;Our Government and Public Sector practice comprises over 1,300 people, more than half of whom work in our consulting business, with the remainder in assurance and tax.&quot; Osborne has announced a consultation on making honest tax payment a condition of winning government contracts. But these companies are woven into every aspect of government and business. The chair of the NAO, Sir Andrew Likierman, is a director of Barclays and past president of the Chartered Institute of Management Consultants. The NAO auditor general, Amyas Morse, was previously global managing partner at PwC. Meanwhile, accountancy firms are major donors to the Conservative party. With political will, all this can be cleaned up. However remiss in office, Labour should seize the initiative. The OECD is urging the G20 to agree on a fair system for taxing companies according to where profits arise \u2013 though countries are locked in cut-throat corporation tax competition. However, the UK controls most tax havens and could shut them down overnight if it copied Charles de Gaulle: angered by tax scamming, he once surrounded Monaco and cut off its water\u00a0supply until it relented.", "sentences": ["How did they put the profits from a whisky blended in Kilmarnock into low-tax Amsterdam?"], "title": "Britain could end these tax scams by hitting the big four | Polly Toynbee", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/10/end-tax-scams-by-hitting-big-four", "tags": ["Tax", "Politics", "George Osborne", "Banking"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-10T23:30:01Z", "article": "People who feel lonely are much more likely than those who do not to develop dementia in old age, according to new research suggesting that loneliness is a risk factor for the condition. Those who suffer from loneliness have a 64% greater risk of dementia, according to a Dutch study that appears in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. But the authors stress that the risk depends on having those feelings and not simply the fact that someone lives alone or is socially isolated. &quot;Individuals with feelings of loneliness remained 1.64 times more likely to develop clinical dementia than persons who did not feel lonely. In contrast, objective aspects of social isolation no longer showed such an association,&quot; concluded the authors of the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly (Amstel), led by Dr Tjalling Jan Holwerda from VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam. &quot;These results suggest that feelings of loneliness independently contribute to the risk of dementia in later life. Interestingly, the fact that &apos;feeling lonely&apos; rather than &apos;being alone&apos; was associated with dementia onset suggests that it is not the objective situation but, rather, the perceived absence of social attachments that increases the risk of cognitive decline,&quot; the authors say. They studied risk factors for depression, dementia and high death rates among 2,173 Dutch people aged 65 or over who did not have dementia, then examined their health again three years later. &quot;We hypothesise that feelings of loneliness may ... be considered a manifestation of the deteriorating social skills that are seen as part of the personality change accompanying the process of dementia,&quot; they conclude. Feeling lonely can be considered &quot;a major risk factor&quot; for dementia, regardless of whether someone has vascular disease or depression, they add. But British experts in Alzheimer&apos;s reacted cautiously to the study. Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer&apos;s Research UK, said someone&apos;s age was still the biggest factor in the development of dementia. &quot;But this study links feelings of loneliness to a slightly higher risk of the condition. While such a finding could have important consequences for society, it is hard to determine cause and effect at this stage. Feelings of loneliness could be a consequence of the early stages of dementia rather than a contributing factor.&quot; Jessica Smith, research officer at the Alzheimer&apos;s Society, said that while &quot;as this study suggests, feeling lonely could have close links to dementia&quot;, more research was needed to ascertain if it was a risk factor or an early symptom of the disease.", "sentences": ["In contrast, objective aspects of social isolation no longer showed such an association,&quot; concluded the authors of the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly (Amstel), led by Dr Tjalling Jan Holwerda from VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam."], "title": "Dementia linked to loneliness, study finds", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/dec/10/loneliness-dementia-link", "tags": ["Dementia", "Alzheimer's", "Depression", "Mental health", "Health", "Society", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-11T00:22:19Z", "article": "Police were treating the inside of a transatlantic flight diverted to Heathrow as a crime scene last night after a male passenger became ill and died. The KLM flight, a Boeing 777 that was bound for Amsterdam from the Peruvian capital, Lima, was diverted after what police described as a medical emergency on board. The plane landed at Heathrow shortly after 2.15pm, where it was met by paramedics, and a male passenger, who is believed to have been in his 30s or 40s, was pronounced dead at the scene. John Hopwood, a nurse from Manchester who was returning after a holiday in South America, said he and other passengers were kept on board the aircraft for five hours before they were told that it was going to be treated as a crime scene and that they would have to disembark. &quot;There was no commotion on board. We were just told initially that someone had taken ill,&quot; he said. After passengers were addressed by a senior police officer in one of Heathrow&apos;s terminals, he said that they had been told by police that the death was being treated as &quot;suspicious&quot;. &quot;[The police officer] said they were bringing a forensics team over from the other side of London,&quot; added Hopwood, who said that he was sitting about six seats behind the passenger, in the economy section of the plane. &quot;We did ask why it took so long for it to be designated as a crime scene. We were kept on the plane for five hours and during that time people would have been walking past the seat where the passenger was.&quot; &quot;People are confused about why it took so long. There are a lot of Latin American people who still have not reached the end of very long journeys, and who were unhappy because there was no one to properly translate what was going on.&quot; A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police confirmed that inquiries were under way into the circumstances of the death, which was being treated as unexplained.

The picture comes from a trio of vast studies by the Amsterdam-based International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), which compared dozens of countries based on assessments carried out at various times on samples of hundreds of thousands of students. The IEA&apos;s methods aim to gauge absolute achievement against set standards, allowing countries to see whether their schools are performing better or worse overall compared with those of others. The so-called Pirls assessment \u2013 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study \u2013 which gauged the language skills of 325,000 students aged about 10, ranked England 11th out of 45 nations, notably better than the 15th from 40 seen in the previous study in 2006. The other two measures fall under the IEA&apos;s Trends in International Maths and Science Study, or Timms, which has a pair of assessments, for students aged about 10 and those around 14, bringing in more than 600,000 children in all. In maths, both age groups in English schools held steady in terms of absolute scores against the last sample, in 2007, although their league places moved slightly. The younger pupils came ninth out of 50 nations and territories against seven from 36 before, with the 14-year-olds 10th out of 42 compared with seventh from 45 in 2007. The news on the science front was less good, with both English age groups losing years of gradual gains to revert back to the scores seen in the first such study in 1995. The 10-year-olds are now rated 15th from 50 entrants, as against seventh out of 36, with the older pupils going from fifth to ninth in a group which reduced from 45 to 42. The three reports, covering almost 1,400 pages in all, carry a wealth of detailed information aimed primarily at education professionals, although other facts stand out, for example that England is ranked 39th out of 45 countries for gender equality in reading, with girls greatly outperforming boys. Such is the studies&apos; size and complexity, much like that of equivalent but separate global education league tables drawn up by the OECD, any government can seize on the data to confirm its policies are correct. The junior education minister, Elizabeth Truss, a right-leaning Tory MP who believes the UK should more closely mirror the hard-edged economic and educational policies of Singapore, Korea and Hong Kong \u2013 all of which cluster near the top of the IEA&apos;s tables \u2013 said a lack of progress in maths and a drop in science was &quot;a real concern&quot; and connected to the end of compulsory tests for all 11-year-olds. In a speech at the London base of Microsoft, Truss said England was now following the lead of &quot;the world&apos;s most successful education states&quot;. She said: &quot;That is why we are driving forward the academy programme and giving schools the freedom to make their own choices. That is why we are bringing in new rigorous exams that will be on a par with the best in the world and reforming the curriculum to focus on core arithmetic, algebra and geometry like high-performing jurisdictions.&quot; The paradox is that while Truss and her boss, the education secretary, Michael Gove, seek a move towards an Asian-style system of crammed facts and rigorous exams, educators in those countries are wrestling with the paradox that their pupils too often emerge competent but narrow and uncreative in their thinking. Earlier this year Singapore&apos;s education minister proposed a long-term move towards a less restrictive system. It is also a good bet that Truss and her colleagues will fail to highlight the position in the IEA tables of Sweden, the government&apos;s model for its ambitious free schools programme. While Sweden saw a marginal improvement in science, its maths scores have flatlined and it is one of only four countries whose reading standards have declined over the past decade.", "sentences": ["The picture comes from a trio of vast studies by the Amsterdam-based International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), which compared dozens of countries based on assessments carried out at various times on samples of hundreds of thousands of students."], "title": "Global survey sees English schools rise in reading but slip in science", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/dec/11/english-schools-reading-science-survey", "tags": ["Schools", "Education", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-11T19:14:46Z", "article": "Dozens of fake and inappropriate jobs have been posted on the government&apos;s new job search website weeks after its launch. The Universal Jobmatch site, which has so far cost taxpayers more than \u00a317m, has advertised fake jobs including for an MI6 &quot;target elimination specialist&quot; and &quot;international couriers&quot; for CosaNostra Holdings, as well as listing pornographic websites. There are fears that jobseekers could become victims of identity theft. On Tuesday, the Department of Work and Pensions minister Iain Duncan Smith admitted 6,000 jobs had been blocked since the site launched on 19 November and scores of employer accounts had been blocked. On Sunday an advertisement was posted for the mafia asking for &quot;three international couriers, ideally with their own transport, who can travel to our production hub in Amsterdam to collect high value packages and bring them into the UK to pass on to our national distribution network&quot;. The posting was later taken down. On Saturday a job appeared for a female presenter paid a little above the minimum wage to host &quot;internet babe chat&quot;. Applicants were asked to send in personal details such as a recent photo, email and age. The company involved, Bluebird Live, could not be contacted but its website is advertising jobs. That posting was also removed following an outcry on social media. Speaking about the pornography job advertisement, Duncan Smith told the Commons: &quot;We already have checks in place. Over 6,000 jobs have been blocked so far. Sixty attempted employer accounts have been blocked and 27 bogus employers have been blocked and we act swiftly if anyone raises a complaint about it.&quot; He added: &quot;Over 5m average daily job searches are working on this [website]. This system will be a massive improvement and a benefit to job seekers.&quot; A search by the Guardian on Tuesday uncovered further fake and dubious adverts. One so-called apparent employer who listed a sales assistant job with pay ranging between \u00a317,000-\u00a325,000 while admitting the company was not a registered business but would apply once it took on employees. The employer would not say whether the business was based in the UK and an address for the company led to a mailbox service in east London. Fears have been raised that criminals could use the site to get personal data included on CVs such as dates of birth, addresses, names, emails and phone numbers. A group of hackers wanting to draw attention to the security flaws in the site  told Channel Four news last week that they had managed to obtain passport and national insurance details from 70 jobseekers. The DWP told the Guardian that the site was still being piloted before a national rollout and that manual checks alongsideas well as automated checks were taking place to combat the problems. The DWP said all new registering employers would now be checked manually to ensure they were genuine. A spokesperson added that CVs placed on site were protected as employers could not see any personal information relating to the jobseekers unless they applied directly for a job. Monster, the company that operates the site, had been previously caught out by Ukrainiane-based hackers in 2007 when the confidential details of more than 1.3 million people were stolen. A manager at one legitimate recruitment business said that he was shocked and angry that his jobs were being placed among fake and inappropriate listings. The manager, who did not want to be named said: &quot;If you don&apos;t have some sort of vetting process on the website then what happens is you got all sorts of, scams, phishing, pornographic adverts and basically the amount of replies dwindles\u2026 and then people don&apos;t use the site. So if they are allowing this to go on, then it is toally taking away the legitimacy of the site itself.&quot; The company said it had placed 300-400 job listings with the government site last month. It added: &quot;As soon as employers are made aware of this going on they aren&apos;t going to want their company names associated with it... That seems absolutely crazy.&quot; Jobseekers told the Guardian they felt they were being forced Responding to criticism, a DWP spokesperson said: &quot;The security of a claimant&apos;s data is of the utmost importance to us and we have a number of checks in place when employers register to use the site. &quot;We are disappointed that a small number of inappropriate adverts have been posted and we have introduced additional checks to address the issue of bogus employers and jobs. &quot;Anybody seeking to acquire personal data by publishing fake job adverts should be aware this is potentially an attempt to commit fraud and that is a criminal offence.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 11 December 2012 because the original stated that thousands of fake and inappropriate jobs had been posted on the government&apos;s new job search website. Dozens of such jobs have actually appeared on the site, and the DWP has since clarified that a ministerial statement about 6,000 jobs being blocked referred to adverts that were blocked before appearing on the website. The article was further amended on 12 December 2012 to correct an error introduced into the article in the earlier attempt to correct the error in the original version, and to revert to the original headline.", "sentences": ["On Sunday an advertisement was posted for the mafia asking for &quot;three international couriers, ideally with their own transport, who can travel to our production hub in Amsterdam to collect high value packages and bring them into the UK to pass on to our national distribution network&quot;."], "title": "Fake and porn jobs on government site", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/11/fake-adverts-government-jobs-website", "tags": ["Job hunting", "Work & careers", "Money", "Iain Duncan Smith", "Politics", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-14T13:04:00Z", "article": "Divisions between David Cameron and Nick Clegg over Britain&apos;s &quot;war on drugs&quot; emerged on Friday after the Liberal Democrat leader said that current policy was not working and accused politicians of &quot;a conspiracy of silence&quot;. Committing his party to pledging a major review of how to tackle the drug problem in its 2015 election manifesto, Clegg claimed Britain was losing the war &quot;on an industrial scale&quot;. He said Cameron should have the courage to look at issues such as decriminalisation or legalisation of drugs. Clegg threw his weight behind the report from the Commons home affairs select committee earlier this week that recommended that a royal commission look at such options. &quot;In politics, as in life, you can&apos;t keep on doing something that does not work,&quot; said Clegg, in an interview with the Sun. &quot;You can&apos;t keep making the same mistakes. &quot;If you were waging any other war where you have 2,000 fatalities a year, your enemies are making billions in profits, constantly throwing new weapons at you and targeting young people \u2013 you&apos;d have to say you are losing and it&apos;s time to do something different.&quot; But Cameron told a press conference in Brussels: &quot;Of course the deputy prime minister is entirely entitled to take a view for the next election and beyond for his manifesto, wanting to go further, wanting a royal commission. &quot;I personally don&apos;t support a royal commission. In my view there&apos;s always a danger, as someone said, that they can take minutes and last for years. &quot;I am very happy to debate and discuss drug policy. I think the coalition government has taken a series of good steps. &quot;The government, I think, has got a good record on these things and there is some good evidence that drug use and drug abuse is falling.&quot; Ed Miliband was opposed to decriminalisation but said drugs policy needed re-examination. &quot;We will look in detail at the home affairs committee report then come to a conclusion. &quot;What would be a problem would be to push into the far future any changes,&quot; said the Labour leader. &quot;We need to look now at whether drugs policy is working. I am not in favour of decriminalisation but we will look at the report.&quot; Clegg said he had already challenged Cameron on the issue. &quot;I was disappointed that the Home Office ruled out an open-minded, level-headed look at all this before the ink had even dried on the committee report,&quot; he said. &quot;I told the prime minister that this was a missed opportunity. He knows my views on this. He and I don&apos;t agree on this.&quot; Clegg criticised attitudes at Westminster. &quot;For too long, people in politics have worried that saying something differently can somehow look like you are being soft. It&apos;s important now to pluck up the courage to speak.&quot; He said politicians knew the &quot;war on drugs&quot; wasn&apos;t working, but when in government they said everything was fine. &quot;We&apos;ve got to level with the British people and tell them what many people already know: it&apos;s time to do something different,&quot; he said. Clegg has asked Jeremy Browne, a Lib Dem Home Office minister, to go on a fact-finding tour to look at approaches in Portugal, Amsterdam, the US and Latin America. He said the former Mexican president Felipe Calder\u00f3n had privately admitted to him last year that his country&apos;s attempt to crush drug barons by military force had failed, claiming 60,000 lives. &quot;He said to me: &apos;It&apos;s not working. We can&apos;t win against these odds.&apos;&quot; Britain should be leading international debate, Clegg said, although he was not in favour of full legalisation. He said decriminalisation of possession while cracking down on traffickers and dealers might be a solution. &quot;Far from being soft, I want to get tougher on gangs who profit from the misery of drug addicts,&quot; he said. Although the coalition government was doing &quot;great things&quot; on treatment, &quot;we owe it to young people to find out what does work and then do it&quot;. A Downing Street spokeswoman was asked whether taxpayers&apos; money should be spent on sending Browne around the world to research changes to drug policy that Cameron opposed. &quot;It is the government&apos;s role to keep policies under review and to ensure that they are meeting what is required, but the prime minister&apos;s view is that the policy is working,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s part and parcel of a minister&apos;s job to make sure that they look at examples of policies in different countries. That&apos;s par for the course in many areas.&quot; Danny Kushlick, of Transform, which campaigns for drugs policy reform, told the Sun Clegg should be congratulated for &quot;telling us the truth about the war on drugs&quot;.", "sentences": ["Clegg has asked Jeremy Browne, a Lib Dem Home Office minister, to go on a fact-finding tour to look at approaches in Portugal, Amsterdam, the US and Latin America."], "title": "Nick Clegg and David Cameron clash over drug law reforms", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/14/nick-clegg-reform-drugs-laws", "tags": ["Drugs policy", "Nick Clegg", "Drugs", "Politics", "UK news", "Society"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-15T00:05:23Z", "article": "Frank Ocean Lost (Def Jam) Rap fool Pitbull likes to list the names of countries in his hits in order to show everyone how popular he is (&quot;Look how many idiots are falling for this shit the world over!&quot; it screams).

Ellie Goulding Figure 8 (Polydor)   Just as Ellie Goulding splits with noted hair criminal and part-time aural activist Skrillex, she goes and releases her most &quot;Skrillex&quot; single yet. After a fairly tuneless intro that features a lot of cooing and general &quot;atmospherics&quot;, there&apos;s one of those almighty drops that makes your bowels shift slightly before the chorus detonates, splintering the song into tiny fragments. It&apos;s a bold choice for a single completely undermined by a video that looks like a poorly realised GCSE media studies version of a perfume advert. Girls Aloud Beautiful &apos;Cause You Love Me (Fascination)   Like most fans of Girls Aloud, I assumed the band&apos;s low point had been reached in 2007 when they teamed up with Sugababes v3 for a depressingly limp reworking of Walk This Way, which at the time was their only single not to have been produced by Xenomania. Well, I was wrong, because at least that was for charity. Beautiful &apos;Cause You Love Me \u2013 a ballad, never their strongest suit \u2013 also misses Xenomania&apos;s midas touch and features lyrics so sappy and toe-curlingly condescending Jessie J would have turned it down for being &quot;a bit much&quot;.

Produced by Rodney Jerkins, the man behind the Spice Girls&apos; last and least-loved album Forever, Hold Me Down is a sweetly sung ode to not giving up even though everyone wants you to. There&apos;s something tragically poetic about it all, really. Robbie Williams Different (Island)   As much as Robbie Williams bangs on about his brief return to Take That rejuvenating him creatively, it&apos;s &quot;interesting&quot; that Different is his second single in a row to feature penmanship from Take That overlord Gary Barlow. It&apos;s as if pop&apos;s very own boring uncle won&apos;t let Williams move on unless he has a say in where he goes next, which if the epic Different is anything to go by, appears to be straight back to therapy. &quot;This time I&apos;ll be special, oh God, make it so&quot;, he strains on the chorus over a musical backing last heard on an Embrace album.

Trafigura has attracted international scrutiny for its links to dumping of toxic waste in the Ivory Coast and for oil trade with Iraq under the United Nations&apos; oil-for-food programme. Now it could be poised to enter the spotlight by spinning off its Puma Energy business, which owns petrol stations, ports and refineries in countries across the developing world. If the share sale were to take place, it would follow Glencore, also based in Switzerland, for selecting London as the place to float. Glencore&apos;s $10bn (\u00a36.2bn) listing last year catapulted the group into the FTSE 100 and made paper billionaires of its five executives. Puma&apos;s chief executive, Pierre Eladari, was reported as saying the company was considering a flotation. &quot;It&apos;s something we are prepared to do,&quot; he told the Sunday Times. &quot;We are almost finished in terms of corporate structuring to be able to do it.&quot; Reports that Puma could go public in the new year are thought to be optimistic. &quot;Puma Energy is well funded by its existing shareholders and has no immediate needs to go to the public markets. As we have stated previously, an [initial public offering] could be one of various options at some point in the future,&quot; Trafigura said on Sunday. The company declined to put a figure on the value of Puma Energy but bankers said that it could be worth about \u00a33bn. It is thought the group would use the money to fuel a spending spree. Puma \u2013 which focuses on the refining, transportation and sale of petrol and other products in the developing world \u2013 bought BP&apos;s southern African arm in 2010 and has bought divisions from Exxon Mobil and Chevron. It is one of the fastest-growing parts of Trafigura&apos;s business and is expected to post profits of about $500m this year from $8bn turnover. Eladari is reported saying that could increase to $700m next year if he succeeds in buying the companies he is circling. Trafigura is privately-owned by about 700 traders who work for the group. Listing Puma would be a means of crystallising their wealth, without ceding control of the parent group. Trafigura sold 20% of Puma Energy to Angola&apos;s state oil company last year, reducing its stake to 65%. It is said to be keen to reduce its holding to below 50% so Puma Energy could raise its own debt. Eladari reportedly said: &quot;The 50% threshold is the key. At that stage, none of our financing would impact Trafigura&apos;s financing.&quot; Trafigura was founded in 1993 by six traders who previously worked for Marc Rich \u2013 the man who broke sanctions against Iran but subsequently received a presidential pardon from Bill Clinton. The company has been rocked by scandal since 2001, when a Trafigura-chartered tanker was intercepted in the Caribbean on suspicion of carrying illegal Iraqi crude. In a settlement, Trafigura agreed to pay a $5m fine, but was not charged with smuggling and denied wrongdoing Then in 2010, Trafigura was found guilty of exporting toxic waste from Amsterdam, which was later dumped in the Ivory Coast, causing a public health crisis. The company agreed to pay \u00a328.7m to compensate the 30,000 victims, although it did not accept legal liability.", "sentences": ["In a settlement, Trafigura agreed to pay a $5m fine, but was not charged with smuggling and denied wrongdoing Then in 2010, Trafigura was found guilty of exporting toxic waste from Amsterdam, which was later dumped in the Ivory Coast, causing a public health crisis."], "title": "Trafigura weighs up \u00a33bn London Stock Exchange flotation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/trafigura-london-stock-exchange-flotation", "tags": ["Trafigura", "Business", "World news", "London Stock Exchange", "Commodities", "Stock markets", "London", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-17T23:11:56Z", "article": "Ten years ago, Bernard Rose proclaimed that digital technology would change the face of movie-making, and he made a film to prove it. Ivansxtc, released in 2000, wasn&apos;t just a calling card for digital cinema: it was also Rose&apos;s goodbye card to the industry that had previously shackled him \u2013 a scathing critique of Hollywood rendered in a new, raw aesthetic. Ivansxtc chronicled the final days of a Hollywood agent, played by Danny Huston and based on Rose&apos;s real-life agent, Jay Moloney, a cocaine-addicted golden boy who killed himself in 1999, aged 35. Faced with death, Huston consoles himself with drugs and prostitutes, while his colleagues treat his impending exit as an inconvenience and an opportunity. The film is a glorious mix of sleaze and grace, a tragedy and a bridge-burning expos\u00e9 \u2013 close enough to the bone to suggest that Rose would never work in that town again, and didn&apos;t much care. &quot;Yeah. Well, I think that&apos;s definitely not the case any more,&quot; says Rose. I last met him around the release of Ivansxtc, when he was fired up with messianic zeal. He looks different now, cooler and healthier. I ask how he&apos;s changed and he pauses for a long time. &quot;I was a lot more ... angry. A lot more \u2026 sort of \u2026 at war with myself. Now I don&apos;t feel that at all.&quot; Hollywood has prevailed, of course. Rose still lives in Los Angeles, and he has worked in that town again. But he has also continued along the path he hacked out with Ivansxtc, following up with 2008&apos;s The Kreutzer Sonata, and now with Boxing Day. As well as the low-budget, digital treatment, what links these three films is that they all star Huston, and are based on Tolstoy short stories. Ivansxtc was an update of The Death of Ivan Ilych. The Kreutzer Sonata transposed Tolstoy&apos;s study of marital jealousy to modern-day LA. Boxing Day reimagines his Master and Man as an ill-fated road trip through the Colorado mountains. In Tolstoy&apos;s original, a wealthy landowner and his driver get lost on their way to buy a forest; here, they are a desperate would-be entrepreneur (Huston) and\u00a0his irritatingly talkative chauffeur, cruising the mountain roads, prospecting cheap, foreclosed\u00a0properties.           The parallel works extremely well. Tolstoy&apos;s themes of class division, capitalist amorality and spiritual emptiness resonate with a credit-crunched America; the insistent voice of the car&apos;s GPS reminds the two men that &quot;guidance cannot be provided&quot;. &quot;What&apos;s great about Tolstoy is that he asks the big questions,&quot; says Rose. &quot;The existential, spiritual and emotional questions, and he really tries to answer them. None of those questions have been resolved by us in the slightest \u2013 we&apos;re still dealing with the same things.&quot; It was Tolstoy who soured Rose&apos;s relationship with Hollywood in the first place. In his early career, he had been making great strides. He left school at 16 and cut his teeth on music videos, directing Frankie Goes to Hollywood&apos;s Relax, among others. His first few features were well received, including the horror film Candyman and Beethoven biopic Immortal Beloved, with Gary Oldman. It was through the latter, specifically Beethoven&apos;s Kreutzer Sonata, that he discovered Tolstoy. &quot;After that I was like, &apos;This guy&apos;s really good, man,&apos;&quot; Rose says, mocking himself with a fake American accent. Then he took on Anna Karenina. It was a major production: all the period trimmings, shot in St Petersburg, a cast led by Sophie Marceau and Sean Bean. But a nervous studio cut the film by half an hour, and the result was a critical and commercial failure. Rose blames himself, too. &quot;What was wrong with Anna Karenina had as much to do with the manner of adapting it as anything else,&quot; he says. &quot;You take an 800-page masterpiece and try to make it into a normal-length movie \u2013 in the end you just boil it down to a story about a woman who leaves her husband for a man who gets bored. And, of course, that&apos;s not the impact of the book. What I realised was that all the carriages and costumes and ballrooms, all that stuff just got in the way. None of it&apos;s got anything to do with the story. Really, the only way to make the story work was to use the same level of honesty Tolstoy used.&quot; There&apos;s a fundamental film-making point here: if a classic text is still relevant, surely it doesn&apos;t need a historical setting? It&apos;s a question worth asking when literary period movies are being churned out: we&apos;ve recently been inundated with Dickens, Austen and Bront\u00eb, not to mention another Anna Karenina. Rose hasn&apos;t seen Joe Wright&apos;s recent version. &quot;But if I was going to do Anna Karenina now, I would make her a Beverly Hills housewife, and have her throw herself under an SUV in the valet parking lot.&quot; Thanks to digital, Rose is free to make films the way he wants, but it&apos;s hard work. On Boxing Day, he is credited as director, screenwriter, cinematographer, editor, even composer and musician (he&apos;s a classically trained pianist). Most of the shoot consisted of just Rose, a sound recordist and the two actors. &quot;When I think about it, we were pretty stupid,&quot; he says. &quot;It was just four of us in a car, no backup. You&apos;re 10,000ft up. The GPS doesn&apos;t work and there&apos;s no phone signal. And it was unbelievably cold: -18 Fahrenheit [-28 degrees celsius], which is not funny.&quot; In a paradoxical twist, it doesn&apos;t look as cold as it really was, Rose explains, since there is no visible condensation on the actors&apos; breath. It was so cold and dry, the air had no moisture in it. Digital film-making hasn&apos;t yet brought Hollywood down, Rose admits, but there&apos;s still time. Anyone can make any film they want now, but getting it seen is a different matter. &quot;The inevitable effect has been an enormous glut of unreleased movies,&quot; he says. This year&apos;s Sundance film festival, for example, received more than 12,000 submissions. &quot;But I think this will evaporate in the next five years, because everything&apos;s going to be online. The thing that&apos;s really going to kill them is the distribution. When everything goes online, which is already happening, it&apos;s gonna change a lot. And then the next question is, can you get paid for it?&quot; Ivansxtc did not get Rose cast out of Hollywood, or not for long. &quot;I don&apos;t think there was any kind of fatwa,&quot; he says. Two years ago he directed Mr Nice, a jaunty studio biopic of drug dealer Howard Marks (Rhys Ifans). He&apos;s also just finished a major film about Paganini, shooting in Berlin and Amsterdam. &quot;I&apos;d still direct the next $100m superhero movie if someone asked me to,&quot; he says. &quot;But it&apos;s nice to do a range of things, big and small. And one feeds on the other. I found that when I went back to doing bigger films, the way I was doing that had changed radically.&quot; Rose isn&apos;t done with Tolstoy, either. He&apos;s already completed a fourth low-budget film, Two Jacks, based on the short story The Two Hussars. Again it stars Huston, alongside his nephew Jack Huston, in a tale contrasting old and new Hollywood.

Those bulges tease the imagination. Nearby, grubby old knitted dolls and stuffed plush animals sit around holding conversations. I hear animal noises. So what&apos;s going on under the blanket, in Mike Kelley&apos;s 1991 Lumpenprole \u2013 are they humping? What muffled whispers do they share, what furtive games are they playing? This is a children&apos;s game played by an adult \u2013 the artist at work. The Lumpenprole of the title won&apos;t grow up, or rather, the play he is indulging in has been consciously dragged too far into adulthood. At the same time, it is a very conscious play on floor-bound sculpture; a refusal of the normative. This seems to be the message, and it&apos;s a message as much about Kelley&apos;s working-class Catholic upbringing in the Detroit suburbs as about his own refusals to conform to gender stereotypes and parental expectations in his youth. Here is an awkward, acne-scarred boy who played with dolls, wore nail varnish and his hair long, was bullied, bunked off and smoked drugs in the mall, played in a band, went to local art school, ended up at CalArts and went on to become one of LA&apos;s \u2013 and America&apos;s \u2013 leading artists. Kelley&apos;s early work was a riposte to the kind of successful 1980s art that revelled in its market-friendliness. But poor art, as well as slick art, comes and goes: art and the market are full of traps. Much of Kelley&apos;s awkwardness and recalcitrance \u2013 let alone his intelligence and humour \u2013 was about resisting the packaging and easy assimilation of the market. He tried to stay a moving target, ahead of the game. Kelley never did learn to conform. Childhood and repressed memories, adolescent rites, traumas and fears fill Kelley&apos;s retrospective, which opened at Amsterdam&apos;s Stedelijk Museum last weekend. It crowds the museum&apos;s new extension. Kelley&apos;s work occupies two new suites of windowless galleries, in the basement and on the first floor. The exhibition admits no daylight; this feels apt. Kelley&apos;s art somehow always demands a bunker or cave, basements and spooky places. There is a sense of siege. There&apos;s too much to take in on a single visit. You feel as if his whole life is here, in room after room of works, hour after hour of film and video, installation after installation, if only you could unravel it. As it is, Kelley&apos;s life came undone by depression and he killed himself, at the age of 57, in January 2012.     Catholic Birdhouse (1978). Photograph courtesy Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts    Planned over several years as a mid-career survey show, this is now a retrospective. It is impossible not to look at his art without reading the artist&apos;s psyche through it. Much of Kelley&apos;s work was not just informed by autobiography, but made overt use of it. His art had a complex relationship to his life, which he used as both material and subject \u2013 whether he was reinventing his childhood in the long, unfinishable series of video and sculptural installations Day is Done (he planned an unmanageable, 365 interconnected installations, only 32 of which were completed in 2004-05), making works based on found high-school yearbooks, or constructing huge tabletop models of the house he grew up in and every educational establishment he ever attended. Kelley&apos;s 1995 Educational Complex is an all-white, bleached-out territory of halls and corridors, changing rooms, studios and classrooms. It incorporates misremembered details with emptiness, registering what he has forgotten or repressed. The model marks time as much as space and place. Peering over it, the model seems endless, measured in decades rather than physical space. There&apos;s even a mattress under the table, so you can lie and look up at the underside of the building. This sub-level is more than a place; it&apos;s a mental state. In the sculpture and video works Day is Done, we are plunged into a world of re-enacted childhood scenes, including nativity plays and one uncomfortable scene set in a barber shop, where a boy is teased about his long hair and frightened by leering barbers. &quot;Do you wanna shave, kid?&quot; Another customer smokes, his bearded mouth sucking lewdly on his pipe. The entire scene is sexualised and stomach-churningly unpleasant, with its innuendoes, bullying and references to the bathroom, which is built into the installation beside the screen. At a certain point, the devil makes an appearance on a second screen. Kelley loses me at this point, and the whole thing tips over into a kind of burlesque. Later, watching a screening of filmed performances and other videos, I come across Kelley himself as the devil, naked and writhing on a bridge at night, some sort of teenage rite. Then, somehow, a whole world is conjured in a toilet bowl, frothy continents and archipelagos formed in a stream of piss by a malevolent god. We&apos;re flushed away with it, ending up back at the bridge. And here&apos;s an actor playing Superman, reading from Sylvia Plath&apos;s The Bell Jar. Superman, and his city of Kandor, itself kept under glass, became a major theme in Kelley&apos;s work over the past decade. I found this \u2013 with its Hammer Horror S&amp;M-lite and its conflation of Superman and Gabriel Dante Rossetti \u2013 an overwrought project when I reviewed it. Kelley, like most artists, had problems with critics. &quot;Artist and critic are dependent on each other but have fundamentally different social positions and world views,&quot; he told an interviewer in 2003. &quot;As the story goes, the artist is uneducated but has a kind of innate gift for visual expression, which the educated and socialised critic must decode for the general population. The pathetic symbiotic relationship of this odd couple is endlessly amusing,&quot; he said.     More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid and The Wages Of Sin (1987).  Photograph courtesy Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts     Decoding isn&apos;t always viable, or even necessary. Not all of what Kelley did is easily read. His art consciously offers resistance, and his own commentaries make matters even murkier. But Kelley liked murk. The preposterously titled video play Extracurricular Activity Projective Reconstruction #1 (Domestic Scene), 2000, is about two men living in a seedy room whose centrepiece is a gas stove. Kelley developed the entire one-act scene from a still he found of a high school performance, and extrapolated the play from this single image. Kelley&apos;s play is as appalling and bleak as it is funny. The dominant man wheedles the other, an unfortunate street person, into putting his head in the oven. How could a performance be both so over-the-top and so nearly believable? I went a bit mad watching it. I&apos;d last seen this almost a decade ago, and its rancid humour had hung around in my head ever since. At his best, Kelley is as direct as he can be obtruse. In this exhibition, I kept losing the plot as well as my way, only to be brought up short by an incident in a video, or an object, a drawing or moment that thrills me, upsets me, makes me wince. Kelley at his best had real edge, whether he was knocking up ludicrous bird boxes, working with a cast of abject soft toys, making horrible scatological drawings or painting a series of shemales which he called Naked Majas after Goya. His art was parodic and painful, full of embarrassment. Maybe it&apos;s too soon for a full-on retrospective. Instead we seem to end up with a show of examples of Kelley&apos;s work rather than one that brings out his best, or most essential. Maybe we are too close properly to address his uneven trajectory \u2013 though retrospectives have a kind of duty to chart more than the highpoints. But right now, it&apos;s the best one we have.", "sentences": ["Childhood and repressed memories, adolescent rites, traumas and fears fill Kelley&apos;s retrospective, which opened at Amsterdam&apos;s Stedelijk Museum last weekend."], "title": "Mike Kelley: the nonconformist's whole life is here", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/dec/18/mike-kelley-nonconformist-whole-life-here", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Exhibitions", "Sculpture", "Netherlands", "Installation", "Film", "Modernism"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-19T10:55:26Z", "article": "Christian Eriksen&apos;s mind drifts back to Denmark&apos;s friendly against England early last year, when Ajax&apos;s prodigiously talented playmaker stole the show. It was a night when the English press had travelled to Copenhagen expecting to write about \u2026 &quot;Wilshere,&quot; Eriksen says, before there is chance to finish the question. &quot;I read that before the game, the fight between the two youngsters \u2013 hopefully I won it.&quot; The verdict was unanimous. Jack Wilshere, who was winning his first full cap, was upstaged along with the rest of England&apos;s team by a player who has become one of the most coveted in Europe. &quot;Too bad that I didn&apos;t score but it was a good game,&quot; Eriksen says, recalling a 2-1 defeat in which he hit the upright. &quot;It was one of my best games for Denmark. Everything was right on time, every pass was good.&quot; His career was already in the fast lane at that point. Eriksen was only 17 when Martin Jol, Ajax&apos;s manager at the time, talked about him in the same breath as Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart. A few months later, he became the youngest player to appear at the 2010 World Cup. In 2011, Eriksen helped Ajax win the title and was named Dutch Talent of the Year and Danish Player of the Year. This summer, at the age of 20, he carried the hopes of a nation. &quot;At the European Championships everybody wanted me to make three goals every game. And everybody hoped that maybe then we would have a chance to go through. But it didn&apos;t happen.&quot; Eriksen delivers far more often than not, though, which is why Europe&apos;s leading clubs are constantly linked with him. There is not much of him \u2013 he is 5ft 9in and has a slight physique \u2013 but with the ball at his feet he is a joy to watch. It is no surprise that the tricks, outrageous nutmegs, sublime goals and eye-of-a-needle passes have prompted comparisons with another great Dane who played for Ajax. &quot;In the beginning it was like you have a Michael Laudrup sign on your back,&quot; Eriksen says, alluding to the parallels that Johan Cruyff and so many others drew when he first broke through. &quot;But now I&apos;ve played a lot of games, I haven&apos;t read about the Laudrup comparison for a long time, so it&apos;s just Eriksen and I think that&apos;s a good thing. I&apos;m my own person and I think that&apos;s what everyone wants because it&apos;s difficult to be somebody else.&quot; Eriksen is talking in the canteen at Ajax&apos;s training ground, which feels like a retirement home for Premier League legends as Edwin van der Sar, Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars, who all work for the club, stroll through. Black and white photographs decorate the walls and provide a reminder of those glorious days when Cruyff inspired a team that won the European Cup three years on the spin in the early 1970s. Ajax&apos;s status has changed since those times, which is why there is an acceptance that Eriksen, who has 18 months left on his contract, will move on at some point. Does he have a preference for the country where he will play next? &quot;I heard sometimes [from others] I would like to play in the sun because it&apos;s better, so Italy or Spain, or in England \u2026 although it&apos;s cold and raining every day and no Christmas, so it&apos;s different there,&quot; he says, laughing. &quot;I&apos;m going to see what opportunities there are but I&apos;m still happy here and I don&apos;t have any thoughts that I have to leave.&quot; Eriksen gives the impression that he loves life in the Netherlands. He speaks Dutch fluently, enjoys the fact that he can walk through the streets of Amsterdam without being hassled \u2013 &quot;It&apos;s only tourists here&quot; \u2013 and sounds sincere in his affection for Ajax and the game he was born to play. &quot;Money has never been a motivation. I have chosen football before that every time and I still do that,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m addicted to football. When I get outside, I just want to stay on the training pitch.&quot; He remembers the days when he spent hours honing his skills in Middelfart, the small Danish town where he grew up &quot;playing a hell of a lot of Football Manager on the computer&quot; and running rings around friends with a ball at his feet. His father, Thomas, coached him from the age of three up until he turned 13, when he joined Odense. Bigger clubs soon took notice. He spent a week with Barcelona, three days with Milan and had two trials with Chelsea, at the age of 14 and 15. Chelsea liked what they saw but not enough to offer Eriksen a contract. &quot;I was not disappointed, for me it was just to see how it goes, it was not really for going [there],&quot; Eriksen says. &quot;It was another world. It was not like Denmark, or like this, where it is open and everyone can come [to training]. Everything was closed and if you are there as a 16-year-old and you have to be so closed, you lose a lot of things. And we thought the football was a little bit more power than what I wanted. &quot;Also Chelsea is such a big club, they have so much money that if they need someone for the first team, they just buy them. Ajax buy them if they are young and they see talent. And it&apos;s easier to go to the first-team here and that was also what I saw. At Chelsea it was like, Under-17 own world, Under-19 own world and then the first team another world. For a [young] player it was difficult to see how there could be a possibility.&quot; Chelsea&apos;s decision not to sign Eriksen was influenced by the fact that they already had Josh McEachran, who played in a similar position and was a year younger. Fast forward five years and McEachran has made one Premier League start for Chelsea and is on loan at Middlesbrough. Eriksen has played 136 times for Ajax. &quot;Exactly,&quot; Eriksen says. &quot;Of course it&apos;s a different league. And a lot of players in England, when they are with big clubs, they go out on loan. That hasn&apos;t ever really been spoken about here because I played. For me, I am at the right place at the right\u00a0time.&quot; It is difficult to think of a better club than Ajax for a gifted youngster, which is why it is easy to understand Eriksen&apos;s decision to reject interest from Manchester City 18 months ago. &quot;Again, it was the feeling to get to a big club where they buy some new players every six months. Then, probably, if you didn&apos;t do well in the beginning, you would go out on loan. I wouldn&apos;t like that. For me, it was just about wanting to play. At that point I was just 19 years old, so I had no hurry.&quot; Has that feeling changed? &quot;But of course we have won two times the championship and we&apos;ve played a lot in the Champions League. When I came everybody was saying: &apos;We have to be champions, we have to play in the Champions League.&apos; Now we have played there for two years and everybody knows how it is. But still, for me, as a young player, you have to play every week and you have to be better and better. That&apos;s what counts.&quot; He smiles when the conversation turns to the four points Ajax took off Manchester City in the Champions League this season. &quot;I think we won [at home] because we played different. In England, you play the long ball and you want the second ball. Here we play between the lines and it&apos;s easier for us to play football. I think everybody saw opportunities because we played against Manchester United last season and that was the same, we had our chances and we didn&apos;t take them. Against City, we took them.&quot; Although there is clearly a perception that English football lags behind technically, Eriksen expresses admiration for the &quot;exciting&quot; and &quot;competitive&quot; nature of the Premier League and leaves the door open to the possibility of playing here one day. &quot;I think for everyone who wants to get to the highest level, you have to be in the Premier League, of course. But when that should be, I have no idea. Maybe 10 years.&quot; The interview is coming to an end but Eriksen knows there is one more question coming and breaks into laughter when it starts with the suggestion that everyone is going to be writing his name when the transfer window opens next month. Could he move? &quot;I don&apos;t think so,&quot; he says. &quot;If something really exciting is coming, maybe you would look at it. But my feeling now is take it easy and see when it comes.&quot; Christian Eriksen has been named in the Guardian&apos;s inaugural World&apos;s Top 100 Footballers series, part 1 of which will be published on theguardian.com at midday on Thursday, counting down to revealing No1 on Monday", "sentences": ["He speaks Dutch fluently, enjoys the fact that he can walk through the streets of Amsterdam without being hassled \u2013 &quot;It&apos;s only tourists here&quot; \u2013 and sounds sincere in his affection for Ajax and the game he was born to play."], "title": "Christian Eriksen: is Ajax's coveted young playmaker ready to move on? | Stuart James", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/19/christian-eriksen-ajax", "tags": ["Christian Eriksen", "Ajax", "Denmark", "Sport", "Football"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-20T23:00:02Z", "article": "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas described Thursday&apos;s Europa League draw as &quot;wonderful and important for the competition&quot; after Tottenham Hotspur were pitted against Lyon and Liverpool drawn with Zenit St Petersburg in the last 32.

Newcastle United take on the Ukrainian side Metalist Kharkiv, with all first-leg matches taking place on 14 February. Tottenham face a last-16 tie against Internazionale if they get past Lyon and the Italian side overcome Cluj. Gareth Bale, who is available to face Stoke City on Saturday after a hamstring injury, scored a hat-trick at San Siro in October 2010, when Spurs lost 4-3 in the Champions League. Villas-Boas, the Tottenham manager, believes the respective ties will boost the allure of a competition that is often maligned when compared with the Champions League. &quot;Lyon is a tremendous tie for us in the sense that it gives this country, along with the Liverpool game, the chance to see wonderful Europa League fixtures being played,&quot; he said. &quot;Zenit-Liverpool and Tottenham-Lyon should both be considered like Champions League fixtures so I think this is something important for the competition, for how it&apos;s seen in this country. &quot;The fact that we play Lyon, who are used to being in the Champions League and used to winning trophies \u2013 it&apos;s an important reference for us. If we want to set our targets for Champions League qualification, this is the kind of team we will face, teams with a winning mentality, full of quality players. In that sense I think it&apos;s excellent for the publicity of the competition in this country. &quot;You see how well they have been doing in the league this year. They have been knocked off first place by Paris St-Germain but they are rebuilding again. They are a club also with financial difficulties. But they have a great winning mentality. It is an extremely difficult draw for us, among one of the worst teams you could get.&quot; Brendan Rodgers welcomed Liverpool&apos;s draw against Zenit, with the tie being staged a month before the start of the league season in Russia, but refused to be drawn on Zenit&apos;s largest supporters&apos; group, Landscrona, calling this week for the club not to buy black or gay players.The Liverpool manager said he would comment on that controversy nearer the time. &quot;It is a good draw for us. It was great to win our group because it means the second leg is at home. Zenit have invested a lot of money to win things but there are a lot of games to go before then,&quot; he said. Newcastle also face a journey to Ukraine and their manager, Alan Pardew, admitted Metalist Kharkiv are an unknown quantity for him. He said: &quot;I do know it&apos;s a long journey, I&apos;ve looked at that, and they won the group, so it&apos;s a tough agenda for us. But obviously, that&apos;s some way ahead and we are looking forward to it. &quot;It&apos;s a tough draw in terms of the travel; the opposition, I know very little about. I can&apos;t even comment on that until such time as we do some studying.&quot; Chelsea supporters who were disappointed at their team&apos;s exit from the Champions League may be appeased slightly with a trip to Prague and a potential game in Amsterdam or Bucharest in the last 16. Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s side will play either Ajax or Steaua if they advance. The Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris is expected to face Lyon, his former club, and Villas-Boas reiterated that Spurs are open to offers for Carlo Cudicini and Heurelho Gomes in January.

A biting wind sweeps across the six pitches at SC Buitenboys, where boys and girls from a couple of junior teams, training under the floodlights, tear around with a ball at their feet, seemingly oblivious to the freezing conditions. For a club run solely by volunteers and which started 27 years ago with a small wooden hut, it is an impressive setup. Almere, where the first house was built in 1976, is one of the fastest-growing cities in Europe, which helps to explain why Buitenboys has become so popular. These days they have 1,175 children and 225 adults playing across 110 teams. Annual membership costs between \u20ac200 and \u20ac255 and the only person on the payroll is the cleaner. Everyone else, including all four board members, works for free. Richard Nieuwenhuizen was among those parents who liked to help out at the club. A popular, football-mad father of three, Nieuwenhuizen lived in Almere with his wife, Xandra, and their two youngest sons, Mykel, 15, and Alain, who recently turned 18. Jamie, the eldest son and a former coach at Buitenboys, lived nearby with his girlfriend. Mykel played for one of Buitenboys&apos; eight under-17 teams and his father enjoyed running the line in those matches, which was what he left home to do on 2 December for a fixture against Nieuw-Sloten, a club from Amsterdam. It was a normal Sunday morning; father and son heading off to football together. By the end of the day Nieuwenhuizen was fighting for his life. The 41-year-old collapsed three hours after he was brutally attacked by a group of Nieuw-Sloten players. The following evening he died. Alongside 4,000 red roses next to the pitch where Nieuwenhuizen fell to the floor sits a banner with a tribute written by Richard&apos;s second son, Alain. It reads: &quot;Dear Daddy, senseless it was, for sure. It will never be better. Once the wounds will heal. But we will never forget you. We will miss you.&quot; &quot;When the one minute&apos;s silence was done in the professional stadiums [the weekend after the incident], they showed that banner,&quot; Rob Mueller, Buitenboys&apos; secretary, says. &quot;Alain made it and we printed it so that they could take it with them on the silent march in Almere.&quot; Mueller walks across to another artificial pitch, about 200 yards away, to show where Nieuwenhuizen was attacked at the end of the game between Buitenboys B3 and Nieuw-Sloten B1 (the B denotes it was an under-17 game and the number reflects the ranking of the team within that age group). The game finished 2-2, with Nieuw-Sloten coming back from two goals down. Those that were present recall a couple of incidents when Nieuw-Sloten players bickered among themselves during the game but say nothing happened to suggest there could be a flashpoint with Nieuwenhuizen after the final whistle. Yet moments after the players started shaking hands with the three volunteer officials, Nieuwenhuizen was knocked to the floor, then punched and kicked in the head by several of the Nieuw-Sloten team. Parents immediately ran on to the pitch to try to defuse the situation and get some control. Nieuwenhuizen eventually got back to his feet but he was knocked to the floor for a second time. Witnesses report that one of the Nieuw-Sloten players then took off his shirt, presumably to make it harder for him to be identified, before kicking Nieuwenhuizen while he was on the ground and then running off. Mykel, Nieuwenhuizen&apos;s son, saw\u00a0everything. Although clearly badly shaken, Nieuwenhuizen was able to stand up. He said he did not wish to involve the police. He decided to go home and returned to Buitenboys later in the afternoon to watch another under-17 game, which kicked off at 2.45pm. Mueller, who was standing on the opposite side of the pitch, watching one of his two sons play, recalls looking across at about 3pm and seeing Nieuwenhuizen get out of the dugout where he had been sitting, stand up and then fall to the floor. &quot;We immediately called for an ambulance and they drove on the pitch and took him to the hospital in Almere,&quot; Mueller says. &quot;I later went to see Richard. I said: &apos;Hi Rich, how are you doing?&apos; He said: &apos;Hi Rob.&apos; And he was very emotional. But at that stage, which was around 7pm, he still recognised me. I saw him once again at around 10pm, when he was still recognising me but he was getting worse. It became really bad so he had to be brought to another hospital, with a neurosurgeon specialist. &quot;In the meantime, we were called by the police to say that Mykel had to make a statement because he was a witness of the incident. So we took him to the police station to make his statement, but we said if we got one call from the hospital we would drive back. At 1am, we got the message from Richard&apos;s wife, Xandra, who said: &apos;It&apos;s not going OK, bring Mykel here.&apos; So the police took him with sirens and lights on, I drove behind. &quot;We stayed there in the waiting room and at around 4am we came to see him once again. He was still in a kind of coma, didn&apos;t recognise anything any more, and that was the last time I saw him alive, knowing already that he would die within six, 12 or 18 hours, because they explained clearly what happened \u2013 the brain was deprived of oxygen. &quot;I went home at about 5am and tried to sleep for a couple of hours. By 9am, I had 71 unanswered phone calls and then the rollercoaster nightmare started. Press came here, television and radio, so we had a small discussion with the board, the president did the television and I did the radio, both knowing that Richard would die but we couldn&apos;t say it. At 5.30pm, we got the call to say that he had died. Then it was not only news in Holland, it was\u00a0news all over the world. So a healthy guy, 41\u00a0years old, was kicked to death in a few seconds.&quot; &apos;People are still in shock&apos;     Flowers, linesmen's flags and the Dutch flag at half-mast surround the pitch where Richard Nieuwenhuizen collapsed    On the day Richard Nieuwenhuizen died, police arrested three teenagers, two aged 15 and another 16. Three days later another 16-year-old was arrested. On 11 December a further three teenagers, two aged 16 and one 17, were arrested along with a 50-year-old man. The seven teenagers all played for Nieuw-Sloten and the 50-year-old is the father of one of the arrested boys. All eight faced charges of manslaughter, assault and public violence. On Wednesday one of the two 15-year-olds was bailed after being charged with public violence rather than assault and manslaughter. The other seven remain in custody. Wim Snoek, Nieuw-Sloten&apos;s secretary and one of the founder members of a club that was formed in 2004, finds it difficult to believe what has happened. &quot;People are still in shock, they don&apos;t know how this could happen at our club, because I think our club is known for normal football,&quot; he says. &quot;We had two incidents earlier this season but a guy at the KNVB [the Dutch Football Association] said that we are in the top four or five teams in Amsterdam, with the fewest problems, so they didn&apos;t understand either.&quot; Snoek admits, though, that one of those incidents this season involved the team that attacked Nieuwenhuizen. &quot;It happened on 14 October,&quot; he says. &quot;The players were shouting at the person who was in charge of the other team. We took measures. Inside our club we have a so\u2011called yellow card for the team. If some players don&apos;t behave properly, we can give the whole team a yellow card. If they get a yellow card, then the next time something happens, big or small, the team will be withdrawn from the competition as a whole. &quot;We had a talk to the team, so we gave them a warning and we also monitored the team during training. We thought they were learning; they behaved better at training, they arrived on time, they didn&apos;t swear at training. So I still don&apos;t understand what has happened on the pitch, why some of the boys blew up. But there is somebody dead and that is very\u00a0tragic.&quot; The KNVB has faced severe criticism for its own handling of the incident. On the Sunday night, when Nieuwenhuizen was dying, Mueller was asked to help the police with their inquiries by contacting the KNVB to get names and addresses of the players involved in the game. The KNVB&apos;s response left him speechless. &quot;I called the KNVB, there is a special number in the case of an emergency, and the first thing he said was: &apos;Do you know what time it is?&apos; I said: &apos;Yeah, I know it&apos;s late, it&apos;s 11.30 in the evening but we have had problems with Nieuw-Sloten.&apos; He said: &apos;Yes, I heard about it.&apos; I said: &apos;OK, but we need some information.&apos; He said: &apos;You are the first call tomorrow morning at nine o&apos;clock.&apos; He was saying: &apos;Ring me back in the morning.&apos; I was angry as hell, of course, because I had seen Richard twice in hospital. I knew how bad it was. &quot;On the Monday morning, I didn&apos;t need to call any more because I knew arrests had been made. But during the day, Marcel [Oost, the club president] or me weren&apos;t called by the KNVB. And whenever the media asked, we said we hadn&apos;t heard anything. At 5.30pm, Richard died and everyone panicked, the KNVB as well, because the press jumped at them. And then one of the KNVB board members said: &apos;We had been in constant contact with the clubs.&apos; I was more angry with that. &quot;Tuesday morning the big guys came over here, including Bernard Fransen [the president of KNVB amateur football], who is a nice guy, and they apologised. And from that moment we got full co-operation. I can&apos;t give any complaints now. But they were very slow initially. They completely misread the situation. Something like this happens, for sure they couldn&apos;t have saved Richard but they could have helped us by sending one guy with media training, who could have said: &apos;Take a seat, we&apos;re going to do it like this.&apos; We would have liked it a lot if someone from the KNVB would have been here.&quot; Fransen admits the KNVB dealt poorly with the situation and says lessons have been learned. &quot;Our first response was not a good one at all. And we have apologised in public. I have been [to Buitenboys] myself for that, and within my organisation we have made sure that we will never, never make the same mistake again. It was an interpretation from one of the workers within the KNVB and it was a misunderstanding \u2013 we can&apos;t allow that. Now, fortunately, the club accepted our apologies and our help afterwards and we have been in close contact from that day.&quot; Following discussions with Buitenboys, the KNVB decided to cancel all 33,000 amateur matches scheduled for the weekend after the incident \u2013 the only other time that has happened since the second world war was during the 1973 oil crisis \u2013 as a mark of respect to Nieuwenhuizen. Buitenboys paid their own tribute with a silent march, on which 12,000 people joined them in Almere, while the following day 800 of the club&apos;s younger players, wearing club colours and each carrying a single red rose, formed a guard of honour when the hearse arrived at the crematorium. In the canteen at the club, which is upstairs in the two-storey building Buitenboys own \u2013 the pitches are rented from the council \u2013 candles flicker next to a framed picture of Nieuwenhuizen. Letters and cards, carrying messages of condolence from as far afield as Colombia and Australia, are piled up on the table. Outside, though, life goes on. A training session is under way on the pitch flanked by the 4,000 roses. &quot;To be quite honest, I want the players to look at the flowers,&quot; Mueller says. &quot;Because I don&apos;t want it to happen again.&quot; There was a fatal incident in Amsterdam 12 months earlier, when a 77-year-old supporter was kicked in the chest by an amateur player who has since been sentenced to three years in prison for manslaughter. That tragedy, however, received nothing like the same publicity as Nieuwenhuizen&apos;s death, which has provoked fierce debate in the Netherlands and been discussed by everyone from Mark Rutte, the prime minister, to Johan Cruyff, the country&apos;s most famous footballer. Eric van der Burg, the Amsterdam alderman whose portfolio in the city covers sport, explains why the response has been so different this time: &quot;What happened last year was horrible but this [latest incident] was more horrible because it was a group of young people \u2013 15 and 16 years old \u2013 and it wasn&apos;t an impulse; they stopped, followed him and kicked him again. And the fact he was a linesman also made it different because every linesman or referee, or their family, asked: &apos;Could it happen to me?&apos; Women told their men: &apos;You can&apos;t be a referee tomorrow because I don&apos;t want to lose you.&apos;&quot; Behind the image of the country that gave us total football, the Netherlands has more than its share of problems, which is why Nieuwenhuizen&apos;s death is being viewed by many in a much broader context and, in some cases, as a damning indictment of Dutch society. There is a strong racial subtext. Geert Wilders, the controversial far-right politician and Dutch Freedom party leader, tweeted: &quot;We don&apos;t have a football problem, we have a Moroccan problem.&quot; The ethnic background of those arrested has never been confirmed by the police or the public prosecution office but it has been reported in the Netherlands that several of the teenagers are of Moroccan descent. Snoek claimed he does not know the identify of all of those who have been arrested but said that, in terms of the team that played against Buitenboys on 2 December, &quot;about six or seven were Moroccans.&quot; He does not, however, accept Wilders&apos;s provocations. &quot;I reject the statement that it is a Moroccan problem. I think it&apos;s a community problem and it starts with the upbringing of the children.&quot; &apos;Give children their game back&apos;     Boys and coaches in one of the changing rooms at SC Buitenboys      Nieuw-Sloten is a relatively new town, which was originally intended to be the site of the Olympic Village for the 1992 games only for Amsterdam to lose out to Barcelona. It has about 15,000 inhabitants and, according to Achmed Baadoud, the chairman of the council of the Amsterdam borough Nieuw-West, it is regarded as &quot;one of the example areas of our district.&quot; Although the teenagers that were arrested played for Nieuw-Sloten, some of them lived in other parts of Nieuw-West, an area with a diverse ethnic mix and not without its problems. Baadoud, who was born in Morocco, says that parental responsibility is a big issue there. &quot;We have a group of parents that when they come with their children [to football], you really don&apos;t want to have them there. And we have another group of parents, they don&apos;t come. They even don&apos;t know in which team their children are playing; they deliver them at the door and they drive away. There are people who don&apos;t even know the teacher of their son or the team leader of the club. There is a lot of work to be done.&quot; He will not, however, accept that the finger of blame can be pointed at one group of people. &quot;It&apos;s very easy to scream and to say it&apos;s a Moroccan problem. On the other hand, I don&apos;t want to say we have no problems. I am very open and clear that we have to discuss. Families really need help and I&apos;m trying to open their eyes. But if you stand outside and you scream it&apos;s a problem, it won&apos;t be solved and it might create another problem \u2013 people will feel: &apos;We are not welcome.&apos;&quot; One thing that just about everyone in the Netherlands seems agreed on is that the country has a major issue with parental behaviour at children&apos;s matches. There is even a television programme, Heibel langs de lijn (Trouble Along the Field), where children can ring up and ask for their parents to be secretly filmed. The footage is then shown back to the parents, who sit alongside their son or daughter and, generally, cringe with embarrassment when they see themselves behaving hysterically and barking at their offspring from the sidelines. Things got so bad in 2007 an organisation called Sire, which is funded by the media industry and tries to raise awareness of social issues in the country, ran adverts on television showing parents behaving badly while watching their child play football. There was a growing feeling in the Netherlands that parents had become preoccupied with seeing their child win, rather than having fun. The campaign slogan was: &quot;Give children their game back.&quot; Four years later, realising things had got little better, Sire carried out further research and released two more adverts, this time showing parents having a bad\u00a0week at work and then taking out their frustration on their children on a Saturday. A spectator was filmed asking the angry\u00a0parent: &quot;Hey, how bad was your\u00a0week?&quot; The slogan at the end said: &quot;Leave Monday to Friday at home on Saturday.&quot; Buitenboys have had their own issues with parents. &quot;Before the incident with Richard we were already discussing here, around the table, the question of whether we should organise a weekend of games without any parents because some of the parents are crazy,&quot; Mueller says. &quot;They don&apos;t know how to behave. They shout and they make arguments to the linesman and the referee. I know for sure that if we had games here without parents, 90% of the incidents would disappear. &quot;We have boys and girls playing here, they are five- and six-year-olds, so they just want to kick the ball, they don&apos;t even know what winning is, but even there you get the parents shouting. We try to say to the parents: &apos;That&apos;s the wrong behaviour, be enthusiastic, be positive.&apos; They don&apos;t listen. And we don&apos;t have the time to continue to watch them.&quot; Van der Burg, who is speaking in his office at Amsterdam&apos;s City Hall, accepts that parents must take a large share of the blame but also believes that those at the top of the game could help to improve standards by being better role models. &quot;It&apos;s more than only parents. I think that professional football gives a bad example,&quot; he says. &quot;If you see European games, international games, matches in Dutch football and the UK, you see bad examples not only of the players but also of the coaches. And there it starts, because all of those little boys see their heroes misbehave and they think it&apos;s normal.&quot; He also has another interesting theory for the lack of respect shown to referees and other people in positions of authority in the Netherlands. &quot;The way we talk to our prime minister \u2013 I shouldn&apos;t think we should have to call him &apos;your excellency&apos;, but in the Netherlands everyone says &apos;Mark&apos; [even in talk shows]. Yet in France, it&apos;s Le President. In the United States, it&apos;s Mr President,&quot; Van der Burg says. &quot;In the Netherlands we certainly say more to a policeman than in a lot of other countries, so when it comes to authority we don&apos;t have the same respect. And I think one of the things we have to get back is respect for authority. It was better at one time and we lost it to policemen, personnel of the ambulance, the fire department \u2013 we have had some incidents there as well. That makes it a bigger problem than football. But, on the other hand, when you compare football with other sports, and even when you correct it for the figures because there are many more football players than in other sports, it&apos;s much more of a problem in football in terms of the number of\u00a0incidents.&quot; &apos;Without respect, no football&apos;     By the entrance to the pitch where the tragedy happened, a sign saying 'without respect you have no football'    In a nation where 1.2 million play football every weekend, the KNVB realises it has to do something. Some measures were implemented prior to Nieuwenhuizen&apos;s death, including special training for referees, severe punishments for abuse of match officials and having a disciplinary team in place that reviews the incidents that take place on a weekend to see if a club needs special attention. A programme was introduced to help board members and volunteers promote respect at amateur clubs. &quot;We try and do everything we can,&quot; Fransen says. &quot;We were thinking we were getting more of a grip on it but all of those rules and all those measures, they take already a long time and it&apos;s not enough. It takes a long time to change this culture, this behaviour. I can say also \u2013 and we are not hiding behind it \u2013 in Holland there is a culture of not accepting referees or authorities; we are a country of discussion. When it is discussion in a decent way, no problem. But when it is shouting and violence, we can&apos;t accept it.&quot; When all the amateur games were cancelled, the KNVB encouraged clubs to meet and talk about programmes that were working well, along with the problems they are experiencing. They also took out full-page newspaper adverts saying: &quot;Without respect, no football.&quot; There are plans to broaden training programmes at grassroots level so coaches are taught how to deal with behavioural issues, as well as the technical aspects of the game in which the Netherlands has for so long excelled. Doing away with linesmen at the majority of matches at amateur level, as is the case in some other European countries, is also being considered because of the accusations volunteers are inevitably left open to if they raise the flag, or keep it down, at the wrong time. The scale of the task facing the KNVB is obvious: even after the wave of publicity surrounding Nieuwenhuizen&apos;s death, another official was attacked in Arnhem last weekend. &quot;You can&apos;t believe it,&quot; Fransen says. &quot;Not so bad as in Almere but it was violence, they were shouting and then one guy hit the referee. After all that has happened \u2026 It was also a friendly game. It&apos;s terrible to say but it happens often. We do what we can and we will not accept it. This is the limit. We are as motivated as we can be to stop this idiocy.&quot; The KNVB must also decide whether Nieuw-Sloten should be allowed to continue. An independent committee is putting together a report as part of the KNVB&apos;s investigation and, depending on the verdict, the governing body has the power to close down the club. Fransen&apos;s view is that &quot;it was not a bad club&quot; before the incident but he also admits: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be proud to be a member,&quot; right now. Nieuw-Sloten held discussions with its 550 members over the weekend to gauge the mood. Snoek confirmed that two of the 41 teams \u2013 a girl&apos;s side and a senior men&apos;s side \u2013 have said they no longer wish to be associated with the club. One child has cancelled his membership after his father said that he was being bullied at school. There is an acceptance that more players may pull out but Nieuw-Sloten&apos;s intention is to carry on, albeit with stiffer punishments for players and parents who misbehave and more stringent checks applied to new members. On Thursday night, Snoek and the Nieuw-Sloten president, Frans Mobron, travelled to Buitenboys to meet Mueller and Oost for the first time since Nieuwenhuizen died. &quot;We talked about the past, the present and the future,&quot; Mueller says. &quot;They are ashamed of what happened and apologised lots of times. I asked specifically: &apos;Did you think you could have prevented it? Did you let guys play in these teams while you were knowing they were dangerous?&apos; They said: &apos;No, we could not have prevented it but now we are changing our rules.&apos;&quot; Buitenboys also have changes in mind. &quot;We will tell the people who come to our ground to play football that we have adopted the words &apos;Without respect, no football&apos;, so if parents are arguing against the referee or linesman, we will stop the game and give them a warning,&quot; Mueller says. &quot;If they continue, we stop the game and the game is finished. For sure, we will have a lot of additional administration but people will get the message. The parents will tell each other: &apos;Keep your big mouth shut or the game will be stopped.&apos; And the children will say in the car: &apos;Well done, Dad. Now I can&apos;t play football.&apos;&quot; It will be another three weeks before Buitenboys play again, on 12 January, after the winter break. There will be a memorial game a few months later \u2013 Frank de Boer, the Ajax manager, will put together a team of former Dutch internationals to take on a Buitenboys XI \u2013 while discussions about a permanent tribute to Nieuwenhuizen are continuing.

There follows, in no particular order, a much more personal selection, most of which are still available. Billy Monk: Nightclub Photographs, Dewi Lewis, \u00a330Alongside Lucas Foglia&apos;s A Natural Order, which I wrote about here, Billy Monk&apos;s Nightclub Photographs is perhaps my favourite photobook of 2012. From 1967 to 1969, Monk was a bouncer in the Catacombs, a sleazy nightclub in Cape Town. He was also an excellent amateur photographer, as this extraordinary book of intimate monochrome reportage shows. Cristina de Middel: The Afronauts, self-published (sold out)Though the first print run is long sold out and De Middel has no plans to republish, I have to include The Afronauts as it&apos;s the most talked about photography book of the year, earning her a place on next year&apos;s Deutsche B\u00f6rse photography prize shortlist. Self-published by the Spanish documentary photographer turned conceptualist, The Afronauts is a fascinating visual exploration of the short-lived Zambian space programme of the 1960s. Catch a glimpse of the work here and on De Middel&apos;s website. Marc Asnin: Uncle Charlie, Contrasto, \u00a335This extraordinary book landed on my desk just in time to be included. Asnin started studying photography in the 1980s and, simultaneously, began snapping his favourite (and most wayward) uncle in and around his home in Brooklyn. A riveting and at times disturbing visual diary of a troubled man with revealing conversations interspersed. Or, as Asnin puts it, &quot;It&apos;s my dance with my godfather.&quot; Paul Graham: The Present, Mack, \u00a345Graham explores the idea of street photography in a book that pays a tentative homage to the tradition as it subverts it. In his adopted city of New York, Graham made a series of twinned photographs, each taken from the same place but seconds apart. The full force of the street, its randomness and strange symmetries of movement and slight repetition, are made manifest \u2013 as is the momentum of street photography. A suspicious photographer in the best sense of the word.     Andy Warhol and Members of the Factory (Gregory Markopoulos, Taylor Mead, Gerard Malanga, Jack Smith) (1963) in the Factory, New York. Photograph: Dennis Hopper Trust    Dennis Hopper: The Lost Album, Prestel, \u00a335The maverick actor and director, who died in 2010, was also a serious photographer. The Lost Album gathers his images from the 1960s, including candid shots of Ike and Tina Turner, Paul Newman and LSD guru Timothy Leary alongside street photographs of hippy gatherings and protests. Meticulously composed shots from a man not known for the steadiness of his vision. Lise Sarfati: She, Twin Palms, \u00a351I interviewed Sarfati back in February for her exhibition She at Brancolini Grimmaldi in London, and found her an engaging and eccentric spirit with a fully formed, slightly leftfield vision. Now comes the book of the same name, featuring Sarfati&apos;s cinematic images of two sisters, Christine and Gina, and Christine&apos;s daughters, Sloane and Sasha. &quot;I like doubles, like mothers and daughters, or sisters or reflections,&quot; says Sarfati. &quot;This represents my research into women&apos;s identities ... I am interested in fixing that instability.&quot; Like all her work, the end result is both intriguing and elusive. Will Steacy: Down These Mean Streets, B Frank Books (sold out)Steacy is a streetwise, left-leaning New York-based photographer and the editor of the excellent Photographs Not Taken, which I reviewed here. Down These Mean Streets is a merging of his own photographs with newspaper clippings, journal entries and various found material pertaining to the long death of the American dream, from Reaganomics in the 1980s to the current economic recession. A radical book that is angry rather than reasoned \u2013 and all the better for that. Stephen Gill: Coexistence, Nobody Books, London, \u00a330Since his 2004 debut, A Book of Field Studies, Stephen Gill has been making increasingly beautiful and ambitious photobooks. His latest is no exception. Available with six different covers, each in an edition of just 250, Coexistence is a visual exploration of a large pond in an area of wasteground in the declining industrial town of Dudelange, Luxembourg. Microscopic photographs of pond water are interwoven with portraits of townspeople in what Gill calls a series of visual &quot;tapestries&quot;. A strangely absorbing book. Alec Soth: Looking for Love, Komenek Books, \u00a332Alec Soth goes back to his early days as a struggling photographer with a day job as a printer in a commercial photo lab and a social life that revolved around a bar and &quot;the solitude I found among strangers&quot;. A series of black-and-white images evoke the atmosphere of his life then: anonymous buildings, high school dances, bar rooms, teenage dating rituals and entwined couples that flirt or gaze sullenly at his camera. Easily Soth&apos;s most melancholy and wilfully monochromatic book.     Orbetello (1974). Photograph: Luigi Ghirri    Luigi Ghirri: Kodachrome, Mack \u00a325For the 20th anniversary of Ghirri&apos;s death, Mack have republished his first book, Kodachrome, which presents a beautifully deadpan view of Italy and, occasionally, Paris and Amsterdam. Billboards, theme parks, deserted playing fields and playgrounds and all kinds of odd details \u2013 people glimpsed through windows or reflected in mirrors; photographs of photographs. A book about colour, irony and what Ghirri called &quot;hieroglyphs&quot;, both obvious and elliptical. Now see this Two contrasting views of London, past and present, are on show at the moment. The first is the actor Steven Berkoff&apos;s East End Photos at the Lucy Bell Gallery in St Leonards-on-Sea. Given his first camera aged 11, Berkoff documented the old Jewish east end of London as it changed rapidly and finally disappeared altogether. &quot;I was fortunate enough to capture some images of that life,&quot; he writes, &quot;before it faded away along with the people who made it so memorable.&quot; Until 13 February 2013. In London itself, the Society Club hosts Stillsoho by Carla Borel, an evocative series of intimate black-and-white portraits of Soho characters from the last decade or so (artists, bohemians, drinkers) including some taken in celebrated hangouts such as the Colony Room and the French House.

Bloomsbury occupied half the Orange shortlist and this was the winner. It&apos;s a\u00a0novel I fell desperately in love with and pre-empted half-wildly. Its publication has been a dream from beginning to end. The book that deserved to do better: It has to be David Park&apos;s humane and beautiful The Light of Amsterdam. Yes, it was chosen for the Fiction Uncovered promotion; yes, it was shortlisted for the Irish Novel of the Year award. But it and its author deserve more. His day will come. I wish I&apos;d published: Zadie Smith&apos;s NW (Hamish Hamilton) because she is, quite simply, the bee&apos;s knees. Richard Beswick, publishing director, Little, Brown &amp; Abacus The book that made my year: After a long and occasionally twitchy gestation, the publication of Tom Holland&apos;s epic retelling of the clash of ancient empires and the rise of Islam, In the Shadow of the Sword, was 90% joy and 10% sheer relief. The book deserved its near-universal praise (with the exception of a rather crotchety man in the Guardian) and reached number 3 in the bestseller list. The book that deserved to do better: Jennie Erdal&apos;s brilliantly witty novel The Missing Shade of Blue sold very respectably and had glowing reviews. But in my dreams she was &quot;podiuming&quot; at the Guildhall. I wish I&apos;d published: I loved John Lanchester&apos;s Capital (Faber), which managed to be clever, funny, moving and informative. One of those on its own is pretty good for a novel. Simon Winder, publishing director, Penguin Press The book that made my year: I was particularly proud to have published Steve Roud and Julia Bishop&apos;s New Penguin Book of English Folk Songs. Every copy we have sold has added to the sum of human happiness. The book that deserved to do better: The Nolympics by Nicholas Lezard. The author and I were talking at the beginning of the year about the usual topic of the time: how the London Olympics was a disgusting nazified honeypot, from which some of the worst people in Britain were helping themselves to billions of pounds of public money, hiding behind the pointless actions of some monomaniac oddballs who ran about for a while or threw stuff. We thought it would be a fun idea if Nick wrote a day-by-day account of this outrage. Everything went exactly as planned \u2013 billions of pounds were taken off in sacks, glasses clinked and everyone geared up to move on to the financially extractive opportunities in Rio. The only unexpected event was that in the opening ceremony the letters &quot;NHS&quot; very briefly flashed up. This so completely disoriented liberals that they suddenly fell into line and went all Leni Riefenstahl for a fortnight. This, sadly, left The Nolympics, a very funny and engaging book, high, dry and unreviewed. I wish I&apos;d published: Chris Ware&apos;s Building Stories (Jonathan Cape). The serious publishing work on this unbelievably complicated and wonderful cardboard box filled with magazines, fold-outs, a diary and various bits of paper \u2013 all adding up to one of the great graphic novels \u2013 was done in New York and the Far East. But I would like to have been able to abuse the traditional editor&apos;s privilege of phoning an author up to burble about how much I admire, cherish and actually love him. Robin Robertson, deputy publishing director, Jonathan Cape The book that made my year: I was pleased for Sean Borodale, whose strange, intense and disarming first poetry collection, Bee Journal, has been shortlisted for many prizes, including the Costa and the Eliot in January. It&apos;s encouraging to see a fresh talent being noticed in an environment that is currently so fractured and factional. The book that deserved to do better: Light Lifting by Alexander MacLeod is a first book of stories, set largely in Windsor, Ontario. The styles and settings of these pieces couldn&apos;t be more different from his father Alistair&apos;s, but they are almost as good: honest, elegant, very powerful. Shortlisted for the Giller prize and already a Canadian bestseller, it received an extraordinary number of positive reviews comparing him to great Canadians such as Atwood, Munro and Ondaatje. Despite all this \u2013 and a series of very successful UK readings \u2013 the book did not sell in significant numbers, which can only be the result of the trade&apos;s prejudice against short stories. I wish I&apos;d published: John Banville&apos;s Ancient Light (Viking); Denis Johnson&apos;s Train Dreams (Granta). Two very different novels by two masters of the form. Roland Philipps, managing director, John Murray The book that made my year: Patrick Leigh Fermor: An Adventure by Artemis Cooper. Because Paddy was the greatest prose writer of the 20th century on the John Murray list, and because Artemis worked over so many years to produce her superb book, which summons the man in all his glory (and failings too). I was anxious that it would not appeal down the generations, but all ages of reader have taken the book up in huge numbers. The book that deserved to do better: The Illicit Happiness of Other People by Manu Joseph. Joseph&apos;s second novel confirms him, to my mind, as one of the leading new Indian novelists \u2013 he tells great truths about modern India while being thoroughly entertaining. It got great reviews in a few places, but not enough, and not enough sales in a very tough environment. I wish I&apos;d published: Bring Up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel (Fourth Estate) \u2013 an electrifying novel, eclipsing even Wolf Hall \u2013 and Robert Macfarlane&apos;s The Old Ways (Hamish Hamilton): travel writing, history, nature and people all beautifully woven together. Prose style aside, it reminded me of Patrick Leigh Fermor&apos;s best work. And Pulphead by John Jeremiah Sullivan (Vintage) had some of the most exciting prose and erudite insights of any book I read. Chris Hamilton-Emery, director, Salt The book that made my year: Without doubt the book that had the biggest impact on Salt was Alison Moore&apos;s Man Booker-shortlisted The Lighthouse, a novel that transcends genre while playing with genre motifs, providing dark humour as well as a deliciously transgressive view of fate and the horrors of recursive human experience. It transformed our finances for 2012 and put us on the map as a fiction publisher. The book that deserved to do better: Susan Wicks&apos;s third novel, A Place to Stop, is a revelatory morality tale and Wicks is an extraordinary prose stylist, well known for her award-winning poetry as well as a terrific memoir. This book puts all her strengths on show. It certainly deserved more critical approval. I wish I&apos;d published: Swimming Home by Deborah Levy, a triumph for another terrific small publisher, And Other Stories. As a subscriber, I&apos;d read this before the Man Booker prize shortlisting, and it&apos;s a wonderful, sly page-turner that plays around with expectations. We bought Levy&apos;s backlist immediately after reading this. Suzanne Baboneau, publishing director, Simon &amp; Schuster The book that made my year: Karen Thompson Walker&apos;s The Age of Miracles. A beautiful, understated debut to which I keep returning. It works on so many levels, making the reader stop and think about the rhythms of our lives and the enormous impact of one tiny twist of nature on the world, a community and a family. The book that deserved to do better: Tim Lott&apos;s Under the Same Stars is the dazzling story of two brothers who go on a road trip to the US looking for their missing father. Their relationship is strained at the best of times, the search for a father who deserted them long ago striking to the very heart of their rivalry. Reviewers were all over this, his first novel for five years; had their excitement translated to book sales, we would certainly have seen a major bestseller. I wish I&apos;d published: Gillian Flynn&apos;s Gone Girl (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson). I would have loved to have taken this extraordinary, one-of-a-kind thriller by the scruff of its neck and tried to publish the hell out of it here, to emulate even some of the incredible success it has had in America. The paperback deserves to be huge on word-of-mouth alone. Jamie Byng, publisher, Canongate The book that made my year: Richard Holloway&apos;s memoir Leaving Alexandria is the sixth book we have published together and the first to hit the bestseller lists. He deserves all the stunning responses he has had for this wise and generous and rewarding book. He is also a joy to know and work with. The book that deserved to do better: James Meek&apos;s The Heart Broke In is a major book in every sense by one of the most entertaining novelists writing today. I had hoped it might do even better than The People&apos;s Act of Love, and it has a lot of fans, but it never got any prize luck. It&apos;s been nominated for the Costa Novel of the Year award, though, so perhaps it will end up getting the wide readership it deserves. I wish I&apos;d published: Always hard to pick, but for financial reasons, Fifty Shades (Arrow); for pure entertainment, Rod: The Autobiography (Century); and for quality, Ben Lerner&apos;s Leaving the Atocha Station (Granta). Philip Gwyn Jones, executive publisher, Granta Books &amp; Portobello Books The book that made my year: Katherine Boo&apos;s Behind the Beautiful Forevers (Portobello). Who would think that a book about poverty in India could capture so many readers and bag so many prize nominations (including the Guardian&apos;s)? To see great literature triumphant is always energising. It proves again that publishing can be surprising, and that masterpieces can still sell to the many. The book that deserved to do better: Keith Ridgway&apos;s Hawthorn &amp; Child (Granta). This gave me my first experience of the publishing power of Twitter. While booksellers failed to order the book in any quantity, up stepped the network of really superb critics who commune about contemporary lit on Twitter to rally round. It has been picking up some &quot;book of the year&quot; mentions, so things are looking up for one of the best novelists on these islands. The book I wish I&apos;d published: If I must single one out, I&apos;ll go for Zadie Smith&apos;s NW. People complain that she leaves things incomplete, takes liberties, should be edited more and so on, but, dammit, she remains by far the most natural and most challenging novelist contemporary Britain has at hand to help imagine itself into what it&apos;s becoming. Stefan Tobler, publisher, And Other Stories The book that made my year: Swimming Home by Deborah Levy. It was so gratifying to see it chosen for the Man Booker shortlist. Levy is finally achieving the recognition she has long deserved \u2013 and her imminent book of stories, Black Vodka, will now reach the audience it deserves. The book that deserved to do better: Lightning Rods by Helen DeWitt. The novel, a hilarious &quot;what if \u2026&quot; book about corporate culture and clich\u00e9, hasn&apos;t done badly, but she&apos;s such a unique writer, it&apos;s disappointing that it hasn&apos;t reached more readers. I wish I&apos;d published: Sombrero Fallout by Richard Brautigan, a gem of a book in Canongate&apos;s Canon series. The slapstick is a hoot but then the lyricism takes you to a much more delicate place. At a punishingly busy time of the year, reading this book was a pure pleasure. Nicholas Pearson, publishing director, Fourth Estate The book that made my year: Best not dream that the first two instalments of a trilogy will both win the Man Booker. Hilary Mantel should have been read in huge numbers for the past 20 years, but it is never too late for everyone to catch up. The book that deserved to do better: Ian Sansom&apos;s Paper: An Elegy. As we enter a world beyond paper, Sansom tells us just how the white stuff has shaped us up to now. Non-fiction at its very best. I wish I&apos;d published: I didn&apos;t have the nerve in the vicious auction for Kevin Powers&apos;s The Yellow Birds (Sceptre), which recently won this paper&apos;s First Book award. It is full of a strange poetry and a fierce honesty, and deserves the high praise that has come its way.", "sentences": ["The book that deserved to do better: It has to be David Park&apos;s humane and beautiful The Light of Amsterdam."], "title": "The publishing year 2012", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/21/year-in-publishing-2012", "tags": ["Publishing", "Culture", "Books", "Best books", "Best books of the year", "Madeline Miller", "Hilary Mantel", "Zadie Smith", "John Lanchester", "Patrick Leigh Fermor", "Deborah Levy", "Alison Moore"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-21T22:55:12Z", "article": "John Banville 1 Who doubted he would be heard by the angelic orders? 2 Who had a precursor in a princedom by the sea? 3 Who worked all day, and got half-drunk at night?

Name the novels from which these three appearances are taken: 1 &quot;[Sir Sidney Ryden] wondered if madam would be a more suitable form of address or perhaps ma&apos;am, as one called the Queen. She looked at him hard and he shifted uncomfortably. He found the new prime minister&apos;s strictures about smoking something of a strain, and longed for a cigarette.

Strong and functional yet ornately decorated, the ranks of chests against the wall are a silent reminder of an eloquent truth. The building of a global empire is principally about the commodity the original owners of these imposing boxes hoped to fill them with: money. In Amsterdam, the city museum has just opened a fascinating new exhibition. They call it simply De Gouden Eeuw (The Golden Age). The age in question is the one that followed the 16th-century Dutch revolt against Spanish rule. The Netherlands became a world power within the space of not much more than a generation. It was also an\u00a0age of Dutch enlightenment, the age of Rembrandt, Spinoza, Grotius and Huygens. In those years, Amsterdam was the capital of the world. That era has long been called the Dutch golden age by historians. Yet an exhibition like this raises wider questions for all postcolonial European nations, including Britain. Can any age of empire, which this certainly was for the Netherlands, be described in something like an exhibition as a golden age? And, how should modern European nations like Britain and the Netherlands present their imperial past to the public? These are not just academic questions. Amsterdam&apos;s answer is full of lessons. The Amsterdam team are not blind to the ironies, or even the hypocrisies, that can sometimes be found behind continuing too confidently to a golden age. As good 21st-century exhibition curators must, they shine their light, a little diffidently at times, on the sordid as well as the splendid aspects of Dutch power. They also deftly point out lots of cultural and political connections and contrasts between Rembrandt&apos;s Amsterdam and that of Geert Wilders today. Nevertheless, you cannot miss the reality that the Amsterdam show exhibits a palpable, continuing pride in the Dutch nation their ancestors created four centuries ago (Amsterdam will also celebrate the 400th anniversary of its canal system in 2013, by the way). And even today the Dutch seem to have strikingly few hangups about describing their country&apos;s defining years as golden. On one level, it isn&apos;t at all hard to see why. In a few short years at the end of the 16th and the start of the 17th century, the Dutch republic made itself the hub of the world. State of the art shipping, weapons and science enabled them to capture and dominate the lucrative spice trade with the East Indies. Back in the Netherlands, the wealth and freedom fuelled by this trade brought a glittering age of writing, painting and technological invention. Their freedom of press and religion was a magnet to the rest of Europe. Its primary monument remains Amsterdam itself, so it is easy to feel the connection to this day. In his modern classic, Vermeer&apos;s Hat, Timothy Brook says simply that 17th-century Netherlands raised the curtain on the global world \u2013 which is our world. The Dutch bought and sold wherever they could find anything to trade. They wrote the fundamentals of international law to suit their needs. They mapped the globe and the heavens. Their way of life became multicultural. When Vermeer painted a geographer in 1669, he\u00a0dressed him in a Japanese kimono and gave him a globe depicting the Indian Ocean. The Amsterdam exhibition tracks all these aspects of globalisation&apos;s first wave. The Dutch established colonies in modern-day Brazil, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Java \u2013 and on Manhattan, too. Theirs was a connected world. In a 1656 picture of the centre of Amsterdam, Ottoman merchants are shown negotiating a deal just round the corner from where the picture itself now hangs. A Dutch translation of the Qur&apos;an was printed there in 1696. But this was a time of slavery and war too. Slavery was illegal in the Netherlands, but Dutch ships carried and sold slaves in Africa and Surinam, and Dutch fortunes waxed rich from the profits of the trade. The Dutch were renowned in China for their violence, and their arms industry \u2013 still the sixth-largest in the world today \u2013 was formidable. By modern standards, Dutch justice was anything but enlightened. Two ghoulish Rembrandt drawings of the public strangulation of a female murderer depict one of the many dark sides of the\u00a0golden\u00a0age. As a British visitor one constantly notices parallels and contrasts. England, in particular, had much in common with the 17th-century Netherlands. Both were northern Protestant republics (briefly in England&apos;s case) with strong navies, ambitious commercial elites and\u00a0a degree of freedom of speech unusual for the time. There is much in the Amsterdam show that resonates across the North Sea. Eventually, however, Britain became richer and more powerful, while the Netherlands dwindled in influence. London became the global city that Amsterdam had once been. The British empire was larger and lasted longer. The English language created a network of soft power that nowadays extends even into every corner of Anglophone Amsterdam itself. Yet we would never call ours a golden age. It is impossible to\u00a0imagine an exhibition on 18th- or 19th-century London that would make such a claim. The only golden age this country acknowledges with any confidence is the 2012 Olympic Games. Perhaps the explanation is only that Dutch prowess began to dwindle so long ago compared with Britain&apos;s more recent decline. Certainly, modern-day Netherlands is extremely conscious that it is now a small country, dependent on European alliances in a way that is manifestly not mirrored in increasingly Eurosceptic Britain. Perhaps a small country feels permitted to dwell on a distant golden age in a way that a bigger one does not. Or perhaps the explanation is simply that the British have not yet learned how to agree an account of the age of British global power and wealth. It would be fascinating to see a credible attempt to contain such a subject within an exhibition similar to the one the Dutch have just mounted in Amsterdam. It would be great to try. The subject may seem too big, too raw and perhaps still too politicised \u2013 until one visits the German Historical Museum in Berlin and realises that tougher assignments have been successfully carried out. A satisfactory alternative modern narrative of British power remains to be written. Perhaps this absence of a settled history helps explain why Britain has such difficulties with its relationship with the EU. Or perhaps \u2013 a nice thought with which to end the year \u2013 our golden age does not lie behind us. Perhaps, echoing Milton, our own golden poet, the world is all before us.", "sentences": ["In Amsterdam, the city museum has just opened a fascinating new exhibition.", "In those years, Amsterdam was the capital of the world.", "Amsterdam&apos;s answer is full of lessons.", "The Amsterdam team are not blind to the ironies, or even the hypocrisies, that can sometimes be found behind continuing too confidently to a golden age.", "They also deftly point out lots of cultural and political connections and contrasts between Rembrandt&apos;s Amsterdam and that of Geert Wilders today.", "Nevertheless, you cannot miss the reality that the Amsterdam show exhibits a palpable, continuing pride in the Dutch nation their ancestors created four centuries ago (Amsterdam will also celebrate the 400th anniversary of its canal system in 2013, by the way).", "Its primary monument remains Amsterdam itself, so it is easy to feel the connection to this day.", "The Amsterdam exhibition tracks all these aspects of globalisation&apos;s first wave.", "In a 1656 picture of the centre of Amsterdam, Ottoman merchants are shown negotiating a deal just round the corner from where the picture itself now hangs.", "There is much in the Amsterdam show that resonates across the North Sea.", "London became the global city that Amsterdam had once been.", "The English language created a network of soft power that nowadays extends even into every corner of Anglophone Amsterdam itself.", "It would be fascinating to see a credible attempt to contain such a subject within an exhibition similar to the one the Dutch have just mounted in Amsterdam."], "title": "The full story of the British empire is yet to be told | Martin Kettle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/28/full-story-british-empire-dutch", "tags": ["Netherlands", "UK news", "Europe", "World news", "Exhibitions", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2012-12-30T20:23:01Z", "article": "View from the Shard  Renzo Piano&apos;s creation, the tallest building in western Europe, finally opens its 69th-floor viewing platform to the public \u2013 at \u00a325 a ticket.
