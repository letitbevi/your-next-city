The church of Santa Teresa in Milan was originally built in 1674, but closed for worship in the early 19th century. The city council purchased the building in 1974 and in 2003 it opened as a media library. No one can tell how many there are. Neither the Catholic church nor the arts departments at various levels of government have seen fit to count them. But there are probably several thousand places of worship all over Italy which have been deconsecrated and sold. The permutations seem endless: here a bar or a country house, an artist&apos;s studio or a garage, there the head office of a bank, a library or function rooms. But sometimes a whiff of incense seems to linger, as if long after the last mass the spirit of the place still clings to the walls. This may be yet another sign of the hard times on which the church has fallen and Italy&apos;s increasingly secular society. But that is not what prompted the Milanese photographer Andrea Di Martino to set up his camera at the entrance to a series of ex-churches. Much as for a passport photograph, he adopted exactly the same angle for each picture: the effect is striking yet poetic, &quot;an encounter between an umbrella and a sewing machine&quot;. &quot;I started the Mass is Ended project four years ago,&quot; says Di Martino. &quot;A bit by chance to start with, in Lombardy, then in other parts of Italy where I was working. After that my research became more systematic, indeed an obsession. I looked for deconsecrated churches all over the place, particularly on the websites of estate agents. I discovered yet more places through the grapevine. My objective now is to cover the whole of Italy, for use in a book to be published next year. Obviously people may put a political spin on my work, see it as an illustration of the church&apos;s decline, but what interests me is primarily the architecture.&quot; More recently, he travelled to China, photographing the area round Shanghai to which whole chunks of European landscape \u2013 an Eiffel tower, a London neighbourhood, an Amsterdam canal \u2013 have been imported. The pictures of churches feel equally strange. Each one seems like a contradiction in terms: a black Audi parked in the nave, a bookcase at the foot of a column. What are they doing there? How about the plastic chairs, reminiscent of some provincial village hall? Who put them there? Who designed these installations? Actually, no one. They just happened by chance or necessity. The destiny of a place can change over time. Nothing lasts forever, even if churches supposedly prepare us for eternal life. There is nothing new about Italian churches being deconsecrated. The Napoleonic campaigns, which foundered on resistance by the papal states, and then Italian unification led to the closure of many places of worship, respectively as an act of vengeance, and for lack of funds. After being turned into barracks or storehouses, they are now coming back on to the market. The price can be high, though, up to \u20ac1m ($1.25m) for the finest, well-maintained specimens. \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde", "sentences": ["Obviously people may put a political spin on my work, see it as an illustration of the church&apos;s decline, but what interests me is primarily the architecture.&quot; More recently, he travelled to China, photographing the area round Shanghai to which whole chunks of European landscape \u2013 an Eiffel tower, a London neighbourhood, an Amsterdam canal \u2013 have been imported."], "title": "Architectural appeal remains as Italy's deconsecrated churches rise again", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jan/01/italy-deconsecrated-churches-andrea-di-martino", "tags": ["Photography", "Architecture", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-03T13:31:21Z", "article": "I went to school on the border of the sleepy university town of Leiden, in the Netherlands. Drugs, ranging from cannabis in coffee shops to much stronger substances, were around. What kept me and almost everyone I knew away from those drugs was detailed information about their effects, which we gathered from our teachers, from television and from teenage magazines. So when I studied at York University in the 90s, I didn&apos;t join the students who took LSD before going into town at night. They said it was great fun but I knew a trip on LSD could go badly wrong. Smoking pot, for sale in government-controlled coffee shops in my home town, would have been a much safer option for them (though not completely harmless either). But in England all drugs seemed to be viewed as equally dangerous. Education and government information have traditionally kept drug-related health problems in the Netherlands low, compared with the rest of Europe. One in five Dutch young people say they have tried cannabis, which is the European average \u2013 but the figures are much lower than average when it comes to hard drugs. In recent years, the Dutch government has therefore been much less worried about health effects of drugs than about the criminal activies relating to its trade. This explains the new rule that came into effect on the first day of 2013. In the Netherlands&apos; coffee shops, only Dutch residents are from now on allowed to buy cannabis (&quot;wiet&quot;), like marijuana and hashish. Before buying a joint, customers need to show a passport or official proof of residency in the Netherlands. The authorities hope that this will help to curb drug trafficking, drug tourism and street crime. The rule follows a 2012 experiment in a long, controversial history of policy-making in regard to drugs: the wietpas (&quot;weed pass&quot;), which was introduced in the spring of 2012 in the southern provinces bordering Belgium and Germany. In effect, the wietpas was a personal membership card for a coffee shop. Coffee shops had to act as exclusive clubs that only Dutch citizens and residents could join. Shop owners were told to keep lists of their clients and were forbidden to sell their stock to non-members. The registration of personal details turned out to be very unpopular, illegal street trade boomed, and the pass was abolished after only six months. Despite the wietpas&apos; lack of success, the government went ahead with the new law anyway, though with some minor amendments, dropping registration but still forbidding people who don&apos;t live in the Netherlands from buying in coffee shops all over the country. To what an extent it will work is questionable: tourists in Amsterdam, at any rate, don&apos;t need to worry. Mayor Eberhard van der Laan announced that foreign visitors are still welcome in his city&apos;s more than 200 coffee shops. He had understandable reasons for doing so: it is estimated that nearly 20% of the 7 million foreign visitors who come to the Netherlands each year visit an Amsterdam coffee shop, pouring millions of euros into the local economy. Other local authorities all over the country are expected to follow Amsterdam&apos;s example. Forbidding foreigners to buy a product that is legal for locals may seem ridiculous. Yet the new rules fit into a long-term policy of pragmatic toleration. Far from having implemented an all-out liberalisation policy, the Netherlands has always pursued a two-pronged strategy: legalising soft drugs while taking a harsh stance on hard drugs, allowing coffee shops, introducing weed passes and banning drug tourists are all part of an effort to control crime and diminish drug trafficking, without filling up Dutch prisons with people caught with a bit of dope in their pockets. Whatever the long-term effects of the official ban on drugs tourism, the policy of pragmatic toleration seems to be generally effective. Despite its coffee shops, the Netherlands are as safe other European countries. As in other countries, reported crime has been going down steadily since the turn of the millennium. For tourists the new rule won&apos;t make much difference. Rembrandt&apos;s paintings and a coffee shop visit still come as a package deal. When it comes to their health, they have little to worry. But at night they might be walking safer streets.", "sentences": ["To what an extent it will work is questionable: tourists in Amsterdam, at any rate, don&apos;t need to worry.", "He had understandable reasons for doing so: it is estimated that nearly 20% of the 7 million foreign visitors who come to the Netherlands each year visit an Amsterdam coffee shop, pouring millions of euros into the local economy.", "Other local authorities all over the country are expected to follow Amsterdam&apos;s example."], "title": "Dutch drug policy, pragmatic as ever | Shirley Hasnoot", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/03/dutch-drug-policy-pragmatic", "tags": ["Netherlands", "Drugs", "Europe", "World news", "Health", "Society"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-06T00:08:00Z", "article": "Why are architects so mercurial? Why is architect-speak so impenetrable? Rowan Moore, the Observer&apos;s architecture critic, answers question one and could not be accused of accusation number two. One of the UK&apos;s most accomplished writers on the profession, he critiques the most important buildings and the people who masterminded them with a style that is both entertaining and cuts through the crap. Why We Build, his new book, does not disappoint. It does not set out to be a definitive study, more a set of musings. As he tours the world, Moore dips into themes. He guides us through the relationship between architecture and eroticism, power and finance in a journey from S\u00e3o Paulo to New York, Beijing and beyond. The more eccentric the destination, the more amusing is the language. The Atlantis hotel in the ridiculous bling fest of Dubai is &quot;a Blofeltian phantasmagoria of giant aquaria and rooms with views of sharks, which suffered the rare ignominy of being accused of bad taste by the British tabloid the Sun&quot;. He stops off at the super-rich folly of self-made software mogul Larry Dean in Atlanta, Georgia \u2013 a mansion the colour of salmon mousse. The marital bed is &quot;engulfed by writhing turquoise vegetables \u2026 and by gooey blossomings the colour of vulvas&quot;. Architecture is perhaps the ultimate form of human self-expression. A less charitable term would be self-indulgence. Sex plays a major part in this narrative, from a farmhouse in Sussex designed for swingers, to the compulsiveness of American architect Stanford White, a &quot;man with fire between his legs and lead between his eyes&quot;. Frank Lloyd Wright apparently built his career &quot;servicing the wives of rich men while designing their\u00a0houses&quot;. From the late 1960s housing estate outside Amsterdam called Bijlmermeer, the author takes us to Moscow, to the Park of National Economic Achievements and the marbled metro stations. These testaments to Stalin personified &quot;force with charm, the twinkling eyes with the mailed fist&quot;. He describes Kijong-dong, a prosperous-looking North Korean town in sight of its enemy to the south, &quot;which turns out to have no glass in its windows nor rooms behind its doors&quot;. Architecture as tool of propaganda is a long-established motif, but instead of the bombast, Moore chooses to focus on the relationship with power, not from the perspective of client, but of architect. Thus in his view Mies van der Rohe &quot;lingered longer in Nazi Germany than was decent, apparently in the hope that the regime might\u00a0adopt his architectural style&quot;. He also tries to explain the thinking of Rem Koolhas when he agreed to build a new HQ for Chinese state television. Moore has conjured a rare feat in producing a work that will be appreciated by professionals and punters alike. My only quibble was the use of small, dusky black-and-white photographs and illustrations. I would have preferred more boldness and\u00a0colour. His overarching message is that buildings are inextricably linked to time and space. They are defined by their context. I agree with this assertion, with a little personal experience. As chair of Turner Contemporary, I watched as David Chipperfield created a gallery by the sea in Margate that has taken the UK art world by storm. Chipperfield is doggedly proud of his achievement; he is also self-deprecating. His &quot;shed&quot;, as he calls it, has transformed not just the built environment but the mood in a town that has seen so little success in recent times. &quot;Buildings will never exist independently of the stuff around them, and the events and thoughts that occur inside them and out,&quot; Moore concludes. &quot;One description of bad architecture is that it ignores this inescapable circumstance.&quot; John Kampfner is the author of Blair&apos;s Wars and Freedom For Sale", "sentences": ["From the late 1960s housing estate outside Amsterdam called Bijlmermeer, the author takes us to Moscow, to the Park of National Economic Achievements and the marbled metro stations."], "title": "Why We Build by Rowan Moore \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/06/why-we-build-moore-review", "tags": ["Art and design", "Architecture", "Books", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-08T15:28:00Z", "article": "Happy 2013 everyone. feanor75&apos;s first book of 2013 is On The Road in its original form: &apos;I think if Kerouac had been allowed to publish this without the edit it may not have sold so well.

Mantuan court painter Lorenzo Costa painted his doctor Battista Fiera as payment for bringing him back to good health. Like the image of Doctor Girolamo Fracastoro, newly attributed to Titian when it was found in the bowels of the National Gallery, Fiera looks a fiercely intelligent figure. And in recognition of his scientific sobriety, he&apos;s also been painted warts-and-all. Many doctors were painted with that same realism and empiricism in Renaissance Italy \u2013 as if a portrait of a doctor should be clinically exact. Lorenzo Lotto&apos;s image of a physician from Bergamo has a moving, lifelike immediacy: Giovanni Agostino della Torre poses with medical books, a man of learning and authority. Later, the artist added the doctor&apos;s son Niccol\u00f2, who peers over his father&apos;s shoulder comically. Artists and doctors were of similar social standing: both were respected professions during the Renaissance, consulted by the highest ranks, but neither were nobles. Maybe this is the birth of middle-class art. In 1456, the Florentine sculptor Antonio Rossellino carved a powerful bust of a renowned doctor called Giovanni di Antonio Chellini da San Miniato. Was Chellini good at his job? Apparently he was terrific, because Donatello, the greatest artist of the age, carved him a beautiful little Madonna in return for treating him. Medicine has something else in common with art \u2013 a fascination with the human body. Rembrandt&apos;s gory painting The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp shows a leading medical authority in 17th-century Amsterdam teaching his students over a dissected corpse: in the 19th century, the American artist Thomas Eakins returned to this eerie theme in his extraordinary work The Gross Clinic. In the 20th century, medical knowledge advanced in previously unimaginable ways, and health was revolutionised \u2013 but doctors became less heroic figures in the eyes of artists. In 1926, Otto Dix painted a silly, disrespectful portrait of a Berlin throat specialist. Reason was losing its rule in Weimar Germany and the professions would soon betray their supposed ideals as doctors, among others, collaborated with the Nazi regime. Dix&apos;s doctor is no saviour, and has no insight.", "sentences": ["Rembrandt&apos;s gory painting The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp shows a leading medical authority in 17th-century Amsterdam teaching his students over a dissected corpse: in the 19th century, the American artist Thomas Eakins returned to this eerie theme in his extraordinary work The Gross Clinic."], "title": "A picture of health: art's warts-and-all view of doctors", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/jan/08/picture-health-art-medicine", "tags": ["Painting", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-09T17:39:00Z", "article": "Here come the circles, radiating from a single point to fill the screen. They keep on coming. Are they approaching or vanishing? Am I looking up at a dome of light or down into a black hole? Patterns collapse inward, and circles of light turn and turn. Everything spirals and surges with an abstract radiation. &quot;It&apos;s just like Bridget Riley!&quot; someone in the dark gallery at the Eye film Museum in Amsterdam says \u2013 but even as she speaks the image has moved on. Spirals, a series of patched-together experiments in abstract animation by Oskar Fischinger, was made in his studio in Munich in the mid-1920s, and comes near the start of a major exhibition of the animator&apos;s work. The Eye film museum is a two-minute free ferry ride across the water from the city&apos;s Central Station. The museum has four cinemas and a large gallery which, since its opening last year, has held exhibitions on the Stanley Kubrick archive and on artist&apos;s film and video work using found footage. The Fischinger show, organised with the Center for Visual Music in Los Angeles, opened just before Christmas. It is a revelation. Born near Frankfurt in 1900, Fischinger trained as a violinist, organ-builder and architectural draughtsman before becoming fascinated by film. At around the time he was making Spirals, Fischinger also embarked on the animation Spiritual Constructions. What kind of spirit are we talking here? The entire film is an alcoholic nightmare. Two silhouetted blokes down steins of beer at a table. Soon, their affable conversation degenerates into violence. Bodies distend and distort. Men become mad linear extrusions. They evolve into dogs and serpents, and never stop morphing. They fall up stairs then tumble down, float on seas of booze and ride waves of queasiness.     Still from Seelische Konstruktionen (Spiritual Constructions), 1927.  Photograph: Center For Visual Music      Keys can&apos;t find locks, chamber-pots are emptied from windows over heads, sentimental protests of love become punch-ups. The animation is uproariously inventive, drunkenness itself becoming an abstract, filmic state. It drew on Fischinger&apos;s childhood memories of growing up in his family&apos;s brewery and tavern. He later moved to Berlin, and during the 1930s his abstract films were enormously popular, shown beside newsreels in cinemas throughout Europe and America. They even found audiences in Asia. Some were made as advertisements for recordings of classical music, and have been regarded as forerunners of pop videos. Imagine Mondrian&apos;s Pier and Ocean paintings animated, or Hans Hartung&apos;s charcoal drawings doing a dance. Who says the general public can&apos;t get abstract art, or couldn&apos;t get it even back when the word avant-garde really meant something? So long as little shapes swooped or trembled or danced to music, they seemed to have purpose and meaning. Fischinger never tried to illustrate music, but to provide a visual equivalent. His commercial work gave him access to advanced film technology, and his own technical innovations led to interest from American film companies. In Germany, he worked on special effects for Fritz Lang&apos;s 1929 Woman in the Moon, and highly abstracted animated film adverts for cinema. But the mid-1930s, his position in Germany became untenable. His art was classed as degenerate by the Nazis and he was refused a permit to work. Moving to Los Angeles in 1936, he went on to animate a section of Walt Disney&apos;s 1940 movie Fantasia, but quit after his animation using Bach&apos;s Toccata and Fugue in D minor was altered and made more realistic by the Disney studio. In the late 1930s, he also met John Cage \u2013 who went on to regard Fischinger&apos;s experimental work with sound and image as an influence.     Still from Radio Dynamics (1942). Photograph: Fischinger Trust, courtesy Center for Visual Music    As it was, Fischinger&apos;s entire career was itself influenced by another pioneer of abstract film, Walter Ruttmann, whose 1921 Lichtspiel Opus 1 he saw at an early performance. Ruttmann&apos;s animation was made by hand painting shapes on glass and filming each brushstroke before it was wiped off the glass, repainted, and filmed again. Ruttmann&apos;s hand-tinted work, projected on several screens, was accompanied by a live orchestra. Ruttmann&apos;s ghost is one of many presences in Fischinger&apos;s work. As one film ends on one of the big hanging screens at Eye, another screen bursts into life. Concentric circles in contrasting colours zoom in and out like animated Kenneth Noland targets. Coloured spirals consume the screen. In a constantly changing palimpsest of overdrawing, it&apos;s one damn thing after another. Patches of Orphim and a sort of homeless pointillism morph into a geometric Paul Klee garden. A bulbous Mir\u00f3 blob hoves into view and Joseph Albers squares jiggle. Here come the spirals again, four or five at once (who can keep count when so much is happening?), turning in on themselves like snakes eating their own tails, all to the music of Bach. A work of great ingenuity and abstract gambits, Fischinger&apos;s Motion Painting No 1, 1947, is the culmination of his career. Fischinger&apos;s filmed painting keeps correcting itself, transforming, developing, layer on layer, move on move. It is exhilarating. Nothing is appropriated, even though one has the impression that entire careers by any number of artists are being spun together. Here&apos;s Mary Heilmann! There&apos;s Tomma Abts! Late Brice Marden! On and on it goes.     Oskar Fischinger in his Hollywood studio with panels from Motion Painting No 1 (1949). Photograph: Fischinger Trust, courtesy Center for Visual Music    All of it was the product of Fischinger&apos;s own playful imagination. No computers were involved, just a guy with a camera stop-framing the evolving images he painted on plexiglass. All these artistic affinities are happenstance, though Fischinger was well acquainted with abstract art. He even made a series of collages in which Mickey Mouse goes crazy inside Kandinsky paintings. For Fischinger, abstraction was fertile, full of life and liveliness. Fischinger emphasises that there are no cuts in Motion Picture No 1, and that what interested him was showing people things they had never seen before. He hoped the film would usher in a new form of art. &quot;All the hidden factors which make a static unmovable finished painting often only understandable to the trained observer become clear to any observer,&quot; he wrote. As it was, Motion Picture No 1 was the last film he made, though he carried on painting until his death. His own static paintings look cramped in comparison to his animated work, and very much of their time. Fischinger died in 1967. His films can look as though they were predicting abstraction&apos;s later development. This of course is just an illusion, like film itself; we are seeing what isn&apos;t there. But then again, to be a painter is also to be pursued by ghosts. The thing is, to keep moving and not look behind you. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2013 to remove the copy of the film &apos;Spirals&apos; and hyperlinks included in this article to other websites to the films &apos;Spirals&apos;, &apos;Spiritual Constructions&apos; and &apos;Motion Painting No 1&apos; following a legal complaint from the Fischinger Trust.", "sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s just like Bridget Riley!&quot; someone in the dark gallery at the Eye film Museum in Amsterdam says \u2013 but even as she speaks the image has moved on."], "title": "Oskar Fischinger: the animation wizard who angered Walt Disney and the Nazis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jan/09/oskar-fischinger-animation-disney-nazis", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Video art", "Film", "Culture", "Animation"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-09T19:30:01Z", "article": "1. The Young Person&apos;s Guide to the Orchestra Recording by Eduard van Beinum with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, 1953 In this recording, the trumpet-player gets so excited towards the end that you can hear his instrument break on the highest note. That would never get through on a recording today; you&apos;d do another take. But Van Beinum and his orchestra obviously liked it and so do I \u2013 it&apos;s a thrilling moment. I first heard this recording when I\u00a0was six or seven, in a music appreciation class at school. It was written to accompany a film called Instruments of the Orchestra. Britten took a baroque theme by Henry Purcell and shaped it, with variations, passing it around all the orchestral instruments. People quickly realised this was an amazing piece of orchestral music, certainly not just something for &quot;a young person&quot;. Programmers often wanted to call it Variations on a Theme by Henry Purcell. But Britten objected \u2013 he didn&apos;t want to sound pretentious, preferring to stick with the title that has endured. I&apos;ve played it to my own children, and it has an important role in the Wes Anderson film Moonrise Kingdom: you see two children leaving home to go off on a trip, and taking this LP with them. 2.A Ceremony of Carols Recording by Westminster Cathedral Choir, 1987            This contains two beautiful solos. I\u00a0sang one at school and could never quite contain my envy when another boy sang the second. It&apos;s for children&apos;s voices and harp, and Britten wrote much of it while sailing back from America in 1942. It&apos;s amazing to think of him composing music as lovely as this on a ropey merchant vessel in the middle of the Atlantic. Britten uses children&apos;s voices to great dramatic effect here, underlining the universality and seriousness of the Christian message. The piece also has this wonderful plainsong entry and exit, underlining the fact that, in the 1940s, a lot of people were looking back to the idea of the medieval community. It almost makes the work a piece of theatre; Britten would use the same idea again later, in his operas. 3. A Boy Was Born, 1933            I first got to know this when I was in a chamber choir at Cambridge University, before I had any notion of becoming a professional singer. We went on tour to Italy and sang this in Rome. This was me coming back to Britten as a tenor, and as an adult. Although he wrote this when he was very young, it&apos;s a work of brilliance, both radical and approachable. I was amazed how much our audience in Rome enjoyed it. 4. Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, 1940            Britten wrote these songs during his three-year stay in America with Peter Pears, the tenor who was his partner and muse. But they were premiered in London, at the Wigmore Hall, in 1942. A set of complicated poems in Renaissance Italian by Michelangelo, they are intensely erotic and homosexual in their imagery. The idea that these two men, who were already pretty unpopular for being pacifists, came back to Britain and got up on stage and performed these songs is extraordinary. I don&apos;t think people quite realised what was happening because the songs were in Italian. I&apos;m just preparing to record these, with Antonio Pappano on piano. They&apos;re different from anything else Britten wrote \u2013 they have their own musical language \u2013 but they&apos;re also very Italianate. Antonio keeps pointing out a bit of Puccini here, a bit of Tosti there. 5.Peter Grimes, 1945 This was Britten&apos;s first big success as an opera composer. He&apos;d written an operetta called Paul Bunyan while he was in America, with WH Auden as librettist. That didn&apos;t work, so he brought this idea back with him, and wrote the main role for Peter Pears. It&apos;s a difficult, transitional piece: Britten hadn&apos;t yet worked out his own language. you get the sense that he&apos;s experimenting, while drawing on examples from the past \u2013 almost trying to write a pastiche realist opera. It&apos;s his most famous work, but really it&apos;s quite unrepresentative; he would develop hugely in subsequent decades. 6. Serenade Recorded by Britten and Pears, 1944 Britten thought of this as very slight \u2013 he often played his work down because he was afraid of people thinking he was pretentious. It&apos;s an anthology of English verse, some well-known, some less so. He had this great idea of having a horn in conversation with the tenor voice throughout. In the prologue, the horn-player has to play without using valves, which makes the instrument sound antique \u2013 and, to our ears, out of tune. There&apos;s also a wonderfully jaunty baroque number with a lot of coloratura, and a setting of an anonymous 15th-century dirge that&apos;s incredibly difficult to sing \u2013 and really quite scary. The last number is sung without the horn; it&apos;s a setting of Keats&apos;s Sonnet to Sleep, and it&apos;s ravishing. 7. The Turn of the Screw, 1954 In 1997, I was cast in Deborah Warner&apos;s production of this, Britten&apos;s most perfect opera. I vowed never to do it again: it felt like we&apos;d reached perfection. What&apos;s interesting is that it has children singing major roles, which is incredibly unusual. In Deborah&apos;s production, a girl sang the girl&apos;s part, rather than a small woman, which made the show more compelling. It&apos;s an ambiguous piece: the reason it&apos;s so scary is because you don&apos;t really know what&apos;s going on. 8. War Requiem Recording by Britten for Decca, 1963 I&apos;ve performed this 62 times. That&apos;s more than any other piece, and a measure of how much the Requiem has caught on. It&apos;s a vast musical endeavour, involving a large choir, a children&apos;s choir, a chamber orchestra, a big orchestra, two male soloists and a great big dramatic soprano. It&apos;s also a great community piece: I recently sang it in Dallas with a children&apos;s choir. Although it was commissioned to celebrate the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral in 1962, the piece has now gone way beyond its origins \u2013 although, like all music, it&apos;s really about life and death. Counting both performances and rehearsals, I must have sat through it at least 200 times \u2013 and I&apos;ve never yet felt bored or unconvinced. 9. Winter Words The recording by Mark Padmore for Harmonia Mundi, 2009 Britten was a great song composer in the tradition of 19th-century German lieder and French songs, which he performed a lot with his mum when he was little. Winter Words showed him at his peak. It uses quirky, difficult poems by Thomas Hardy that you wouldn&apos;t immediately imagine could be set to music. There&apos;s one about a creaking table, one about the memory of a lost loved one, another about a boy playing a violin at a railway station with a convict singing along (Britten uses the piano to create the idea of the violin being played badly). He sets English words like nobody else. Gerald Finzi, an English composer of roughly the same period, also set a lot of Hardy \u2013 but where Finzi follows the poetry dutifully, Britten grabs it, shakes it, yet somehow stays true to it. 10. String Quartet No 3, 1975 I love Britten&apos;s string quartet repertoire and there&apos;s not a lot of it, since he was mostly a vocal composer. I remember hearing the Belcea Quartet play this. One movement quotes from Death in Venice, his last opera. It has the feeling of a very late work \u2013 as if it&apos;s written by someone who&apos;s coming to terms with the fact he&apos;s going to\u00a0die. \u2022 Ian Bostridge performs Winter Words at Birmingham Town Hall, 16 January, as part of A Boy Was Born: Celebrating the Britten Anniversary in Birmingham.

But it triggers two irresistible pieces of speculation. First, what will Rattle do next? He will be 63 in 2018, early middle age by the standards of orchestral conductors, who often work until well into their 80s. Second, who will get Rattle&apos;s \u00fcber-prestigious job when he packs his bags? Even today, the Berlin job remains the pinnacle of the conducting profession. Rattle will have notched 16 years in Berlin by the time he quits. That&apos;s a good innings by anyone&apos;s standards. He was appointed to take over from Claudio Abbado because the Berlin players \u2013 who select their own boss \u2013 hoped he he could maintain Berlin&apos;s wonderful sound, forged in the eras of Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler and Herbert von Karajan during the mid-20th century, but simultaneously throw open the doors to the Philharmonie and drag what is still widely regarded as the greatest symphony orchestra in the world into the 21st century. On both counts, Rattle has lived up to those expectations. After an occasionally shaky start \u2013 there were rumours early on that the Berlin players were disappointed in Rattle&apos;s interpretations of the core central European repertoire of Beethoven, Brahms and Bruckner \u2014 the Liverpool-born conductor has won plaudits for his work on the classics. Five years ago, in 2008, the musicians extended his contract for another 10 years, to 2018, a huge vote of confidence. Since then his work has deepened. Meanwhile, like Abbado before him, Rattle has opened up the Berliners&apos; repertoire, putting contemporary works frequently on the menu, and taking the orchestra into schools and local communities to help break down barriers and stereotypes. The orchestra itself has been transformed, no longer all-male and all-German but now emphatically multi-national and with something approaching an equal male-female balance. Rattle will leave Berlin still at the height of his powers and with his reputation \u2013 rooted in his 18-year transformation of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in the 1980s and 90s \u2013 burnished still further. By 2018, however, Rattle will no longer be the glamorous whizz-kid he once was. The long, curly, black locks went white many years ago, and the prodigy will soon become a veteran. It seems unlikely he will look for another long-term, ful-ltime post like the ones he has held in Birmingham and Berlin. Rattle is more likely to forge a series of special relationships with orchestras and opera houses that excite his interest. He often works in London with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, and makes his next appearance in the UK with them in London at the end of January. Though he could probably be guest conductor of almost any orchestra in the world, he seems likely to do things his own way. Perhaps, like Abbado after leaving Berlin, he will build a festival and an orchestra around him, as the Italian has done in Lucerne. The remarkably extended five-year contest to succeed Rattle in Berlin guarantees that most of the big names in classical music will be heading for the German capital over the coming seasons. Strategically, the Philharmoniker will surely be tempted to skip a generation and stay on the cutting edge of orchestral life. In that case, there is bound to be speculation, and commercial pressure, for them to hand the baton to Venezuela&apos;s charismatic 31-year-old Gustavo Dudamel, now in charge of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, or even Britain&apos;s hugely admired Robin Ticciati, 29. Vasily Petrenko, the 36-year-old chief conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, must also stand a strong chance of becoming the Berliners&apos; first Russian boss. But if the Berliners think the young pretenders must wait their turn before ascending to the most prestigious podium of them all, there will be no lack of contenders to choose from. Germany&apos;s great traditionalist Christian Thielemann, now 53 and currently based in Dresden, is sure to covet the job, and has recently been broadening his repertoire in ways that are likely to help his chances. Italy&apos;s Riccardo Chailly, in charge of the Leipzig Gewandhaus and just two years older than Rattle, would be on most people&apos;s shortlists. So would the veteran Latvian Mariss Jansons, who leads two of the world&apos;s top orchestras already, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and the Munich-based Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. The favourite, though, could well be another young maestro whose career has prospered, like Rattle&apos;s, in Birmingham. Andris Nelsons, another Latvian and still only 34, is the hottest conducting property in Europe today. Nelsons is surely the man to beat.", "sentences": ["So would the veteran Latvian Mariss Jansons, who leads two of the world&apos;s top orchestras already, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and the Munich-based Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra."], "title": "Simon Rattle is to leave Berlin: what next for him and the Philharmoniker?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/10/simon-rattle-berliner-philharmoniker", "tags": ["Simon Rattle", "Berlin Philharmonic", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Germany", "Europe", "Conducting"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-11T17:40:29Z", "article": "There are strong indications that in 2014 the United Kingdom will host the Giro d&apos;Italia as well as the Tour de France, which will start in Leeds. The French newspaper L&apos;Equipe reported that according to sources in Italy, Belfast is set to be the start city for the 2014 Giro, which will then head south into the Republic of Ireland, with a stage to Dublin. The Giro d&apos;Italia organisers, RCS Sport, were not available for comment as of Friday afternoon. The joint Irish bid was leaked in late October to the Belfast Telegraph. Costs for the bid have been estimated at just under \u00a34m, with an estimated income for the local economy of about \u00a310m. The bid was put together by the Northern Irish Tourist Board and Failte Ireland with input from both Stormont and the Irish government. Belfast city council is also understood to be putting in \u00a3400,000. It is expected that the Giro&apos;s start, known as the Grande Partenza, would take place over the bank holiday weekend of 2-4 May. The event normally encompasses six days, with a three-day festival being followed by the first three stages of the race proper. Asked about the report, the Giro director, Michele Acquarone, told Cycling Weekly that he first needed to concentrate on the start of the 2013 season before giving full concentration to the 2014 Giro. The Giro press officer Matteo Cavazzuti said that &quot;at the moment our position is no comment&quot;. The Giro this year starts in Naples on 4 May with a sprint stage that should suit Mark Cavendish and Omega Pharma-QuickStep. The Tour de France champion, Bradley Wiggins ,will lead Team Sky. &quot;It&apos;s complicated in this moment, we are navigating in the dark right now, one step at a time,&quot; Acquarone added. &quot;We have a lot of irons in the fire, and until the season gets going I won&apos;t rest easy.&quot; While Dublin has hosted world class cycling before, having been the site for the Grand D\u00e9part of the 1998 Tour de France, the Giro start would be a novelty for Northern Ireland, which boasts a five-day amateur stage race, the Tour of the North, and which occasionally hosted brief diversions by the erstwhile Nissan Classic professional Tour of Ireland. The Giro d&apos;Italia will start in Naples this year but has made regular excursions far outside the confines of Italy, with a race start in Belgium as long ago as 1972. A Belfast start in 2014 would follow a recent pattern whereby the Giro starts outside Italy every other year: in 2012 the race began in Herning, Denmark, with a time trial and two flat stages, while the 2010 event started in Amsterdam, Holland.

The problem is when outcomes are confused by ideology. The language of &quot;activism&quot;, &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; etc should have no place in the educational debate. What springs out of John Harris&apos;s even-handed article is the passion each school has in creating what it believes are effective environments for children&apos;s development. But this is not exclusively the province of free schools: many educators in state schools, local authorities and even the Department for Education are driven by this same desire and not poisoned by ideological dogma.Tim TaylorTrowse, Norfolk Free schools have the potential to become unregulated centres for prejudice, ignorance and exclusivity, because they will be permitted to be run outside the remit of state supervision and cherry-pick intake. The myth that they are responsive to local needs is shattered when you examine those who have set up such schools, the children they allow in them, and the schemes that were rejected which had about them far more of a sense of localism.

Often sold online as &quot;bath salts&quot; or &quot;plant food&quot; because they are not permitted to be marketed for human consumption, legal highs may be legal or, confusingly, illegal. The active ingredients in similarly named drugs are also often completely different. &quot;The legal highs market is flooded with scammers and people selling legal and illegal drugs,&quot; says Mike Power, author of a new book, Drugs 2.0: The Web Revolution that is Changing the Way the World Gets High, which is published in May. &quot;The more new drugs are banned, the more new drugs are invented. It&apos;s like a game of Whack-a-Mole.&quot; According to Power, new drugs are commissioned based on an existing illegal drug such as ketamine, with globalised drug labs attaching a couple of additional molecules to an illegal drug to render their new variant legal in the UK. &quot;The innovation is constant and the chemistry is infinite. It&apos;s so beyond the knowledge of any normal police officer or politician, I pity them having to deal with it,&quot; he says. &quot;The simple answer would be to legalise the safer drugs and people wouldn&apos;t be looking for alternatives.&quot; Harry Shapiro of the charity DrugScope says consumers of legal highs should not assume they are legal \u2013 or any safer than illegal drugs. &quot;Don&apos;t be taken in by the marketing,&quot; says Shapiro. &quot;However these products are marketed \u2013 whether as legal or safe alternatives to cannabis and ecstasy \u2013 treat them with utmost caution. Don&apos;t assume they are any safer or less risky than any of the other drugs that have been on the streets for years.&quot; There are three broad families of &quot;legal&quot; highs or &quot;new&quot; drugs. Most popular are synthetic cannabinoids and speed or ecstasy-type substitutes such as mephedrone. There are also psychedelic or hallucinogenic legal highs.     'Spice' \u2026 a popular synthetic cannabinoid. Photograph: Boris Roessler    Synthetic cannabinoids Common names/brands: Annihilation, Black Mamba, Spice, Amsterdam Gold, Bombay Blue Extreme, X, Karma These mimic the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active compound in cannabis, and are usually sold as herbal smoking mixtures. Annihilation, for instance, is marketed as &quot;herbal incense&quot; and sold in packets decorated with a picture of a mushroom cloud. As the Frank drugs advice website reports, anecdotal evidence of the effects of AM2201, the synthetic cannabinoid commonly found in Annihilation and Black Mamba, includes increasing heart rate and causing panic attacks and convulsions. A large number of synthetic cannabinoids have been designated class B drugs. As with all legal highs, it is unfortunately not clear for users what brands are legal and which are not, and many brands vary enormously in the compounds they contain. Mephedrone Common names/brands: Miaow miaow, Bubble, White Magic, MC, M-Cat, Bounce, 4-MMC The stimulant mephedrone is the leading new drug to gain traction in the British drugs market, despite being made illegal several years ago. &quot;It&apos;s quite common as a club and street drug and is used by people with traditional heroin or crack problems as well,&quot; says Harry Shapiro of DrugScope. Often regarded as having an effect similar to ecstasy and cocaine, mephedrone can make users talkative and euphoric or sick and anxious. Like similar more traditional drugs, it can risk overstimulating the heart and nervous system. In 2010, there were six reported deaths from mephedrone in England and Wales, according to the Frank website. Mephedrone is now a blass B drug but some similar brand names have not yet been banned. Bubble is widely used in the north-west but its content varies enormously. 2-DPMP Common names/brands: Ivory Wave, Purple Wave, Vanilla Sky, D2PM A powerful stimulant usually sold as &quot;bath salts&quot;, the amphetamine-like effects of 2-DPMP, 2-diphenylmethylpyrrolidine, or desoxypipradrol, have been found to cause &quot;prolonged agitation&quot; lasting for up to five days in some cases. Like many other &quot;new&quot; and once-legal highs, there is little research into its long-term effects, and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended in 2011 it be made illegal. In June last year, 2-DPMP and related compounds such as D2PM and Diphenylmethylpyrrolidine were designated a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act. APB or Benzo Fury APB compounds such as 5-APB and 6-APB are stimulants found in the drug Benzo Fury, which is marketed as a legal high. Testing of Benzo Fury purchased online has found some to contain 5-APB or 6-APB whilst others contain completely different active substances. This is regarded as an ecstasy-type drug, based on MDA and with similar effects and risks. Last summer, media reports linked its consumption to the death of a 19-year-old man at the Rockness festival in Scotland. 5-APB/6-APB is not a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 but once again, drug charities warn that consumers can never be sure of the safety of such legal substances, or if their &quot;legal high&quot; contains illegal substances. \u2022 The government-funded drugs advice Frank website has more information on the many different legal and illegal drugs available.", "sentences": ["Photograph: Boris Roessler    Synthetic cannabinoids Common names/brands: Annihilation, Black Mamba, Spice, Amsterdam Gold, Bombay Blue Extreme, X, Karma These mimic the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active compound in cannabis, and are usually sold as herbal smoking mixtures."], "title": "From mephedrone to Benzo Fury: the new 'legal highs'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2013/jan/14/mephedrone-benzo-fury-legal-highs", "tags": ["Drugs", "Drugs policy", "Health", "Society", "Politics", "Cannabis", "Mephedrone", "Legal highs"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-16T10:00:00Z", "article": "Expat life has been kind to Matthew Bonnett, an assistant professor in financial accounting at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Not only has he met his American girlfriend though Cantonese lessons, he&apos;s able to indulge his love of football at weekends. &quot;I&apos;ve integrated with some of the locals, mainly through the local football league. It&apos;s nice to go to different sports grounds, watch the games and make friends.&quot; Hong Kong can be as international or local as you prefer, and a western face won&apos;t stand out. &quot;If you&apos;ve never been to Asia before you can still have home comforts but slowly dip your toe into Asian life,&quot; says Bonnett. Like many academics who have uprooted to Hong Kong and south-east Asia, Bonnett has been here a relatively long time \u2013 since 2008 \u2013 and he has an incentive to stay on for at least another three years. Anyone who lives in Hong Kong for seven consecutive years can apply for permanent residency \u2013 and subsequently enjoy most of the rights of Hong Kong citizens, including the right to vote. Growth area &quot;It&apos;s an interesting good time to train the next generation of business leaders, with the balance of power slowly shifting from the US to China,&quot; says Bonnett. Salaries are generous and investment in higher education is high: this month CUHK moved its business faculty into a new 15-storey building. What&apos;s more, Hong Kong universities rank among the finest in Asia. Three of Hong Kong&apos;s universities are among the top 50 worldwide, according to this year&apos;s Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) rankings \u2013 and institutions here are hiring academic staff from overseas to boost their international profile. &quot;You can make good money here in academia compared with the UK,&quot; says Bonnett. A strong work ethic And the teaching is rewarding, say international staff who have made the move. Students are motivated \u2013 undergraduates face fierce competition for places at Hong Kong&apos;s leading universities and it&apos;s not unusual to see students milling around campus in suits. Academics say the work ethic is strong throughout institutions, from teaching staff down to undergraduates. &quot;It&apos;s common to see lights on in people&apos;s offices late in the evenings or at weekends,&quot; says Dr Wouter Stam, who moved from Amsterdam to teach management at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2009. &quot;During summer [Amsterdam universities] would be like ghost towns. Here, faculties continue to work.&quot; Stam finds his colleagues more reserved than back home. &quot;Hong Kong people are very family oriented \u2013 when they have spare time they most likely won&apos;t spend it with expats who might leave again.&quot; As for the students, Bonnett says his cohort tend to be driven and ambitious, yet shy of speaking up. While local Hong Kong academics switch easily between Mandarin to Cantonese and English, it&apos;s possible to work here with English only \u2013 although universities can offer subsidised language lessons. Bonnett came alone, but families relocating will find competition for international primary school places is high, so it&apos;s important to apply well in advance. CUHK helped Bonnett with paperwork on arrival and provided a housing allowance \u2013 property costs in Hong Kong are famously steep and many international academics choose to live on campus. But cheap living more than makes up for this \u2013 salaries are taxed at around 15%, restaurants are good value and a short taxi fare comes in at under \u00a32. Location, location... While the character of Hong Kong&apos;s universities depends on location \u2013 HKU, complete with on-campus bonsai trees, is central, while CUHK is in the quieter New Territories \u2013 a whizzy transport system means it takes about an hour to cross from one side to the other. Hong Kong, a leading financial hub, is crowded and 24-hour shopping opportunities are legendary. Typhoons can add a frisson to Hong Kong life, &quot;though I think it&apos;s mostly the expats who get excited about a typhoon warning,&quot; says Bonnett, and summers can be fiercely hot and humid. While Hong Kong&apos;s dramatic skyline signals just how densely built-up the centre is, expats do escape to the country parks, to the many beaches and get out on the water in junks, dinghies or kayaks. China is 20 minutes by train, Macau an hour by boat and some weekenders fly to south-east Asian countries. &quot;Even though I&apos;ve been here nearly four years I don&apos;t get tired of seeing the harbour, the hills or the amazing landscapes of Hong Kong,&quot; says Bonnett.

A highly cultured polyglot, he&apos;s perfectly at home on the continent and happy to use Brussels as a bully pulpit to bash governments back home \u2013 something that would once have been regarded as terribly bad form. What he and his ilk object to, at least in part, is Britain being stuck in what they see as a hopelessly over-regulated historical relic when by rights we should be a freewheeling world trader.            But the past still matters as much as the future. Preserving national sovereignty probably remains Conservative sceptics&apos; ultimate concern. Inevitably, this no surrender stance connects them umbilically not only to their icon Margaret Thatcher, but to her icon Winston Churchill.            It also accounts for their hatred of her immediate predecessor, Ted Heath, who supposedly sold the party and the country down the river by taking it into Europe in the first place.            Of course, as Michael Heseltine pointed out earlier in the week, Eurosceptics are forced to forget about Thatcher&apos;s initially pragmatic European policy \u2013 and that she was responsible for one of the biggest surrenders of UK sovereignty, the Single European Act. Indeed, as others have pointed out, sceptics would be well advised not to read her famous Bruges speech too closely, lest they remind themselves of the awkward truth that, even though she grew increasingly impatient with Europe when she was prime minister, she showed no signs of wanting to actually leave what was then the European community.            In fact, it&apos;s another of their heroine&apos;s classic speeches that comes closest to serving as a sacred text for Tory sceptics. Her parliamentary No, No, No not only told Brussels where to get off, but triggered what they insist on seeing as the Europhile plot that saw her stabbed in the back by Geoffrey Howe, challenged for the leadership by Heseltine, persuaded to step down by Ken Clarke, and replaced by John Major \u2013 the architect of the Maastricht treaty which, while it saved us from the single currency, drove us even deeper into what henceforth became the European Union.            It was on Major&apos;s watch, of course, that Britain was forced into a humiliating exit from the European exchange rate mechanism on &quot;Black Wednesday&quot; \u2013 a memory burned into sceptics&apos; brains by the shell-shocked speech made by Norman Lamont (you can see a young David Cameron walking in front of Lamont in the first few seconds of this video) after he&apos;d blown billions trying (but failing) to save sterling. To this day, this episode provides proof, should proof be needed, that getting too closely entangled in Europe only ever ends in tears. The fact that the euro \u2013 which the ERM helped usher in \u2013 is now in so much trouble only goes to show, sceptics believe, that we are better off out of the whole sorry mess. The ensuing civil war over Maastricht&apos;s ratification tore the party apart and made Major look &quot;weak, weak, weak&quot;, turning what may well have been a Labour victory anyway into a landslide that took more than a decade to overturn \u2013 a repeat of which, apparently, can only be prevented by a prime minister who follows his party rather than lead it.            Free from the shabby compromises made necessary by being in office, those 13 years in opposition simply fuelled Eurosceptic fantasies \u2013 fantasies that David Cameron to some extent shared and was in any case too weak to try to tackle head on. As a result, Europe was always going to be the iceberg issue for a Tory government. Consequently, the prime minister finds himself torn between the temptation to talk and act tough in order to please his party \u2013 something that briefly turned him into a Eurosceptic hero in December 2011 \u2013 and the day-to-day business of promoting the national interest in an interdependent, multi-level and multinational political and economic space. Doing anything like the latter, however, precludes adopting wholesale the pub-ready populism of Nigel Farage, whose beating up of Tony Blair \u2013 the man who for so long gave the Tories such a pasting \u2013 afforded Conservatives as much pleasure as it did Ukippers.

For the third time in a row, after Margaret Thatcher and John Major, it is David Cameron&apos;s turn. Churchill in Zurich, Thatcher in Bruges. On Friday morning, Cameron is in Amsterdam for what is billed as the defining speech of his first term. It&apos;s a tightrope act where the prime minister has both to appease a restive party and the Daily Mail while reassuring not only the rest of Europe&apos;s leaders, but Washington, too, international investors, the markets, and British business. Mission impossible? Squeezed on both sides by irreconcilable pressures, Cameron, seen from across the Channel, appears more a prisoner than a master of events. A bit like the sorcerer&apos;s apprentice, said Martin Schulz, head of the European parliament, invoking the image of Goethe&apos;s young wizard who summons into life forces he cannot control. &quot;The British are usually pragmatic. But he&apos;s making a big mess,&quot; said Jean-Claude Piris, until two years ago the EU&apos;s most senior lawyer. The problems with the speech are multiple. They start with its half-baked preparation, confusion as to the venue, the last-minute rush to secure an audience, and big questions about timing. Why make the speech at all right now? Cameron bases his argument for a new deal for Britain in Europe on the impact of the euro crisis. It is true that the past three years are forcing and have forced big changes in the way the eurozone is structured and how power is wielded. But everything is in flux. No one has a clue what Europe will look like in a few years&apos; time. Better to let the dust settle and then take a calmer look at things. Besides, Cameron&apos;s actions smack of disloyalty, an unseemly rush to extract national and party political advantage from a European catastrophe without making any contribution to the solutions. &quot;EU leaders should make it clear to Mr Cameron that they cannot be blackmailed by his constant demands for exemptions from common EU standards and values,&quot; said Hannes Swoboda, head of the social democrats in the European parliament. &quot;This all comes at a very bad moment because we are all obsessed with the euro, with our survival,&quot; said Piris. &quot;Things have gone too far.&quot; If Cameron&apos;s end is a new deal for Britain, the means are to reopen the European treaties and unpick what has long been negotiated, signed and ratified in order to claw back powers from the Brussels bogeyman. It&apos;s the first time a British prime minister has been so strident in demanding treaty revision. And no one else has the stomach for it. Indeed, the name of the game in Brussels, Paris and Berlin right now is to avoid treaty change at all costs. In response to the euro crisis, the Europeans over the past three years have established bailout funds, fiscal pacts, a raft of legislation foreseeing more centralised control of budgets and spending and the beginnings of a new eurozone banking supervisor. All of this without reopening the Lisbon treaty. The leaders&apos; absolute priority is to focus on getting this difficult and complex new regime up and running, rather than being diverted into another marathon of bad-tempered late nights and horsetrading. Besides, the only time that the Europeans wanted to reopen the Lisbon treaty, 13 months ago to make Angela Merkel&apos;s fiscal pact European law, they were blocked by one man, Cameron, who wielded his Brussels summit veto. He was ignored. The Europeans did the pact as an international agreement instead. If push comes to shove, they can do the same again to spur greater fiscal, economic and political integration in the eurozone, bypassing Britain and leaving Cameron looking impotent, his cries for treaty change hollow and misjudged. &quot;The fundamentals the EU is based on are not negotiable. In the middle of the severe economic crisis, it is not the right time to discuss treaty change,&quot; said Swoboda. If the Europeans are telling Cameron to be careful what you wish for, there is also plenty of goodwill towards Britain and real anxiety about the perceived drift to the EU exit. Europe is in the grip of seismic shifts, rent both by centripetal and centrifugal forces. Germany and France are groping towards a new understanding indirectly reflecting Berlin&apos;s weight and Paris&apos;s relative decline. Balance of power politics are as alive as ever and Britain is still one of the EU&apos;s big three. The Dutch, the Scandinavians and other smaller countries look to the UK to save them from being at the mercy of a Franco-German directorate. The Germans need northern, liberal Britain to counter the prospect of a French-led dirigiste Club Med keen to redistribute German wealth. The French, who almost uniquely in Europe have kept quiet on the Cameron question, might be the obvious proponents of Brexit \u2013 let the Brits go. But they would then find themselves on the wrong side of an increasingly unequal relationship with the Germans. The Europeans want to keep the Brits in. But that does not mean they will bend over backwards to keep Cameron happy. The message in advance of the speech is no cherry-picking of the rules, no special exemptions or opt-outs and no treaty reopening to cut Cameron a new deal. A more minimal agenda focused on &quot;subsidiarity&quot; \u2013 meaning less concentration of power in Brussels and leaving national governments in charge of more policy areas \u2013 might be on offer, for everyone, not just the UK, after the European elections and the establishment of a new European commission in 2014. Whether that could be sold in Britain as the big new deal and tested winningly in a referendum looks doubtful. Europe might be toxic for modern Tory prime ministers. On the biggest things, though, the Conservative party can lay fair claim to being absolutely right when at their most pro-European. Back in the 70s when Labour was the natural home of Euroscepticism, the Tories took Britain into Europe. Thatcher championed the single market, the biggest achievement. Europe&apos;s most successful ever foreign policy \u2013 unification with eastern Europe after the cold war \u2013 was driven by the Conservatives as well as Tony Blair in the face of much continental resistance. And Britain avoided Europe&apos;s most ambitious failure, the single currency, because of John Major at Maastricht. It&apos;s an impressive record. Cameron has got plenty to boast about in Amsterdam.

The message that Algiers wants to retain complete control of the response to the crisis was delivered to Cameron by his Algerian counterpart, Abdelmalek Sellal, in a telephone call on Wednesday. One British government source said: &quot;The Algerian government understandably very much sees itself as being in the lead on its sovereign territory.

It is very much an Algerian and BP-led process.&quot; The gas field is operated by BP in partnership with Norway&apos;s Statoil and the Algerian state oil firm Sonatrach, with a Japanese firm, JGC Corp, providing services. Downing Street said Cameron had told Sellal that Britain would consider any requests for assistance.

Downing Street indicated that the prime minister would deliver his speech, in which he planned to warn that Britain could &quot;drift towards the exit&quot; unless powers are handed back from the EU, once the hostage crisis had ended. The postponement was announced shortly before the prime minister was due to fly to meet the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, before his speech in Amsterdam. Some Tories were surprised that No\u00a010 took so long to abandon the trip. Downing Street had acknowledged the gravity of the crisis in Algeria on Thursday morning by announcing that arrangements were being made for the prime minister to chair a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee from The Hague on Friday. Ed Miliband, who was privately suggesting that the prime minister appeared to be putting the interests of Conservative Eurosceptics above his duties to deal with a security crisis, had earlier said that the prime minister had spent six years preparing a speech that will cause five years of uncertainty. Cameron had been due to warn his fellow European leaders that British membership of the EU could be put at risk unless its membership terms are changed. &quot;If we don&apos;t address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and the British people will drift towards the exit,&quot; Cameron was due to say in the speech to an audience of business leaders in Amsterdam. &quot;There is a growing frustration that the EU is seen as something that is done to people rather than acting on their behalf. And this is being intensified by the very solutions required to resolve the economic problems. &quot;People are increasingly frustrated that decisions taken further and further away from them mean their living standards are slashed through enforced austerity or their taxes are used to bail out governments on the other side of the continent.&quot; The prime minister had planned to brief the leaders of France and Italy on his speech, after earlier discussing what he was planning to say with US president Barack Obama after the White House had made clear last week it wanted &quot;a strong British voice&quot; in Europe. Last night the White House made clear that Obama maintained the pressure on Cameron in the call. A spokesman said: &quot;The president underscored our close alliance with the United Kingdom and said that the United States values a strong UK in a strong European Union, which makes critical contributions to peace, prosperity, and security in Europe and around the world.&quot; Cameron was due to declare that he will demand the repatriation of some powers if he wins an overall majority at the next election. The new terms of British membership would then be put to the people in a referendum, possibly around 2018.

And this is being intensified by the very solutions required to resolve the economic problems. People are increasingly frustrated that decisions taken further and further away from them mean their living standards are slashed through enforced austerity or their taxes are used to bail out governments on the other side of the continent. &quot;More of the same will not secure a long-term future for the eurozone. More of the same will not see the European Union keeping pace with the new powerhouse economies. More of the same will not bring the European Union any closer to its citizens. More of the same will just produce more of the same \u2013 less competitiveness, less growth, fewer jobs. And that will make our countries weaker, not stronger,&quot; Cameron was due to say. But the prime minister was given a taste of the unease among business leaders when one of Britain&apos;s most senior business leaders warned of the dangers of &quot;inconsequential isolation&quot;. Sir Andrew Cahn, until recently head of the government&apos;s main overseas trade body, UK Trade and Investment, told the Guardian: &quot;The chill factor is there, the nagging worry that the UK is retreating into inconsequential isolation.&quot; Lord Browne, the former BP boss, said: &quot;Uncertainty is the enemy of investment, and we should be wary of doing anything which tarnishes Britain&apos;s reputation as a home of choice for human and financial capital.&quot; The prime minister was due to say that he supports British membership of the EU and that his aim is to stabilise support in Britain by addressing concerns about power amassed in Brussels. He wants to use a major revision of the Lisbon treaty, which may take place after the European parliamentary elections in 2014, to table his demand for the repatriation of social and employment legislation. Cameron planned to identify the three major challenges facing Europe as the eurozone crisis, weak European competitiveness, and a lack of democratic accountability. Failure to address these would increase support among those who want to leave, though he was due to say that is not his preference. &quot;I do not want that to happen. I want the European Union to be a success and I want a relationship between Britain and the EU that keeps us in it.&quot; European unease over his speech manifested itself when the president of the European parliament warned that the prime minster could be disastrous for the EU. Martin Schulz, a German SPD MEP, wrote on the Huffington Post website that the prime minister wanted to set a &quot;dangerous precedent&quot;, which might lead to the &quot;breakup of the EU&quot;. But the prime minister last night won support from Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, who has in the past criticised Cameron&apos;s encouragement of greater integration in the eurozone. The London mayor moderated his position by saying that Britain should permit moves towards greater fiscal co-ordination in the eurozone. In remarks briefed before the prime minister&apos;s speech was cancelled, Johnson said Cameron should tell the EU: &quot;We will allow you to use our common EU institutions \u2013 which we help fund \u2013 to pursue your project, if you help us with a renegotiation.

It shares first place with Sri Lanka in the annual Post Office Worldwide Holiday Costs Barometer \u2013 which compares in-resort prices for a shopping basket of eight items including drinks, suncream and a meal for two \u2013 as the best value places to stay out of 42 surveyed. But if you&apos;re heading to Australia, the survey makes grim reading. Holiday essentials cost a remarkable four times the amount holidaymakers pay in Spain. The Post Office found that a typical meal out for two, with a bottle of wine, will set you back \u00a3106 in Australia compared with \u00a322 on the Costa del Sol. The good news for travellers on a budget is that prices are down in around a third of the destinations surveyed, with widespread cost-cutting by restaurants and bars. In Europe, for example, the basket of goods tested has fallen 18% in Greece (Corfu) to \u00a357.50, making prices a third cheaper than Italy (Sorrento) at \u00a387.06, the most expensive of six eurozone destinations surveyed. Winter sun is now perhaps most affordable in Egypt, after a fall in prices of around 20% in resorts such as Sharm el Sheikh, where the basket of goods cost \u00a356.02. Egypt is struggling to regain ground after the scenes of protests and revolution in Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square deterred tourists. It is now 45% cheaper than mid-haul competitor Dubai, at \u00a3101.69. In the Caribbean, resort costs have fallen sharply in Barbados, accounting for a 26% drop in the barometer basket to \u00a384.24. By contrast, higher meal prices have made Jamaica 18% more expensive than last year, at \u00a397.59. Sri Lanka registered a 27% increase but remains cheapest of the 42 destinations, because a weaker currency helped to cushion the blow of significant price rises in the country&apos;s beach resorts. The Czech Republic (\u00a339.17) is in third place for the third consecutive year, followed by Bali (\u00a340.47), which has leapt up from 12th place last year through a combination of lower resort prices and a weaker Indonesian rupiah. At number five, Vietnam (\u00a343.20) is up five places on the back of lower meal prices. Good news for bargain hunters is that prices have tumbled in Turkey, where meal prices are down 22%, probably because of fierce competition between restaurants after cuts in flight capacity brought fewer visitors during 2012. This took Turkey (\u00a352.89) back into the top 10 for the first time since 2008. Rising resort prices in Thailand (\u00a358.31) mean that holidaymakers can expect to pay 22% more than 12 months ago and the destination has fallen from the top 10 to 16th place.

Pretty soon, he began playing with the form by scratching, piercing and drawing all over his negatives. He was a relentless experimenter throughout his whole life, moving from painting to photography before becoming a pioneer of concrete art \u2013 and one of the most influential Brazilian artists of the 20th century. Then, in the 1990s \u2013 following a 40-year layoff, and after a series of strokes had left him semi-paralysed \u2013 De Barros picked up his camera again. Now, the two photography series that bookmarked his career \u2013 Fotoformas (1948-1950) and Sobras (1996-1998) \u2013 are on show in Britain for the first time at the Photographers&apos; Gallery. De Barros made his Fotoformas works, influenced by the Bauhaus and Paul Klee, with a Rolleiflex 6x6 twin-lens camera. In them, he often superimposed one image over another to make geometric shapes that seem to float on the page. Other images from the series include: an egg hovering over a wooden door where the handle should be; spheres sitting on telegraph wires against a grey sky, like a still from an early sci-fi film; a leafless tree in an expanse of white broken only by a thin black line. This early body of work is an intriguing testament to a restless imagination that reacted instinctively against accepted photographic practice. He once said: &quot;For me, photography is a process of printing.&quot; But, for him, it was also a process of disrupting, interfering and experimenting.     Restless imagination \u2026\u00a0Untitled by Geraldo de Barros (Tyrol, Austria, 1951). Photograph: Courtesy of artist and The Photographers' Gallery, London    The whole Fotoformas series was first shown in his breakthrough exhibition at the Museu de Arte de S\u00e3o Paulo in 1950. It earned him a scholarship to Europe, where he fell under the spell of concrete art and abandoned photography altogether. Then, in 1993, his daughter found his early photographs as she was sifting through his archive, and they were shown at the Mus\u00e9e de l&apos;Elys\u00e9e in Lausanne in Switzerland. De Barros was belatedly hailed as a master of abstract photography, and this renewed interest seems to have spurred him on to return to the medium. In the last two years of his life, though incapacitated, he made the 250 works that comprise the series Sobras (Remains). Here the raw material is family snapshots and portraits, which have been cut up and rearranged into beautiful, painterly collages tending toward the surreal \u2013 glowering pink clouds sit atop a grand building by an eerie lake and each element is bordered by black tape, drawing attention to the process as well as the resulting image. They are strange and bewitching works that echo the creations of John Stezaker and, as their name suggests, have a haunting, elegiac quality.     Ethereal \u2026 Laura Letinsky's Ill Form and Void Full I Untitled 29, 2011. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and The Photographers' Gallery, London    On another floor of the Photographers&apos; Gallery, Laura Letinsky&apos;s ethereal collages of food and objects play with the notion of what is real and what is illusory. Titled Ill Form and Void Full, after a phrase by the modernist writer Gertrude Stein, the work manages to be beautiful and intriguing, though bloodless \u2013 all those anaemic tones. Using images of food, drink and utensils from lifestyle magazines as well as her own photographs, Letinsky creates formal arrangements of paper cutouts and the odd real object \u2013 a silver spoon, a glass. They are precisely arranged against a white background in a studio and photographed using a large format camera to capture every detail \u2013 a smudge, a trace of lipstick, a crumb. Printed lifesize and often containing strange shadows and perspectives that may be real or part of the construction, they refer to the impossible, idealised notion of home that magazines perpetuate. Ultimately, though, it is photography that Letinsky is questioning, and its role in what she calls &quot;the circuitry of production and consumption&quot; that underpins lifestyle culture. I am not sure the work quite manages to carry the claims she makes on its behalf, but it is certainly singular in its elaboration.

Now see this Juergen Teller&apos;s recent work is the subject of a show called Woo at the ICA in London, opening on 23 January.

At 9am on Friday, the exhausted prime minister sat down to chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee on the gathering Algerian hostage crisis and to reflect on northern Mali, the world&apos;s newest &quot;ungoverned space&quot;. He had been expecting to be standing in a striking concert hall in Amsterdam, delivering a long-awaited speech warning that the over-governed space of the European Union might force the British people to drift to the exit door. Instead of briefing EU leaders on the diplomatic consequences of his speech, he was on the phone to Algerian prime minister, Abdelmalek Sellal, for the fourth time in three days asking anxiously about the fate of UK hostages. Instead of questioning EU solidarity, he went to the House of Commons to stand shoulder to shoulder with the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and support an EU training mission to suppress the &quot;savage threat&quot; posed by the terrorists of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb. In truth, multi-tasking is a necessary requirement of any prime minister and Cameron has been forced to manage the confluence of his European speech and the crisis in the Sahel. Once Cameron was briefed late on Thursday that as many as 30 British hostages might have been killed or captured, he knew the jinxed EU speech had to give way. Yet extensive, embargoed extracts of the speech had already been emailed to journalists travelling to the Netherlands. Downing Street decided the extracts could not be withdrawn. In the internet age, suppression is doomed. The tantric wait for the full speech will now continue for another month, thwarting No 10&apos;s hopes that the European issue could finally be parked. However, some of Cameron&apos;s sanguine aides believe the intense pre-speech debate has at least fostered a better climate for those, like Cameron, who oppose Britain&apos;s exit. But with Europe set aside, Cameron was free to focus solely on the other great UK foreign policy challenge; what he described as the existential threat posed by terrorism. He is no stranger to war or terror and those who work with him in these crises describe him as clear, calm and focused. He inherited one war in Afghanistan and initiated another in Libya. He has experienced successes in hostage crises \u2013 the release of Afghanistan aid worker Helen Johnston \u2013 as well as tragedies. In October 2010, Linda Norgrove, a UK aid worker, was killed by a grenade thrown by US special forces trying to rescue her from a Taliban-linked group in Afghanistan. In March last year, British special forces stormed a compound in northern Nigeria leading to the death of Chris McManus and an Italian kidnapped by jihadist group Boko Haram. The foreign secretary, William Hague, was forced to go to Rome to apologise for the failure to warn the Italian government of the planned rescue. It is these mixed experiences that may have led Cameron to rein in his anger with the Algerians for their failure to consult him before their attack on terrorists at the In Amenas oil terminal. &quot;One can have the ultimate degree of planning,&quot; he told MPs, &quot;and still find that these events end unhappily.&quot; Moreover, the Algerian crisis is different to his previous hostage episodes, not just due to its scale. It is being held in the full glare of the global media and, as Cameron said in his Commons statement, judgments are nuanced on how much to reveal, given that one audience may the terrorist themselves. The Algerians, determined not to be seen at the mercy of western governments, have rebuffed Cameron&apos;s offers of intelligence help at least twice and he did not hide his disappointment that he had not been informed before the attack. But what has been most remarkable is the degree to which these setbacks have not weakened the prime minister&apos;s determination to engage in north Africa. He made a strong case for intervention in the Sahel, reminding MPs he had appointed his own special envoy to the region, Stephen O&apos;Brien, a former international development minister. Cameron said: &quot;Those who believe that there is a terrorist, extremist al-Qaida problem in parts of north Africa, but that it is a problem for those places and we can somehow back off and ignore it, are profoundly wrong. This is a problem for those places and for us.&quot; He acknowledged that the region was primarily a French sphere of influence but, in the wake of Libya and given Britain&apos;s energy interests, including in Nigeria, he said it was time to &quot;thicken&quot; UK involvement in the area. &quot;We face a large and existential terrorist threat from a group of extremists based in different parts of the world who want to do the biggest possible amount of damage to our interests and way of life,&quot; he said. &quot;Those extremists thrive when they have ungoverned spaces in which they can exist, build and plan.&quot; It is just these arguments that led to the allied intervention in Afghanistan.", "sentences": ["He had been expecting to be standing in a striking concert hall in Amsterdam, delivering a long-awaited speech warning that the over-governed space of the European Union might force the British people to drift to the exit door."], "title": "David Cameron puts Algeria and Mali crises ahead of EU speech", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/18/david-cameron-algeria-mali-eu", "tags": ["David Cameron", "Politics", "Algerian hostage crisis", "Algeria", "World news", "Mali", "Africa", "Foreign policy", "UK news", "European Union", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-19T21:15:37Z", "article": "David Cameron will deliver a &quot;red-meat announcement&quot; on Britain&apos;s future in the EU, which he believes will satisfy all but a hard core of Conservative MPs, when he makes his much-delayed keynote speech on Europe in the next few days. Amid uncertainty over the exact timing of the jinxed address, senior government sources told the Observer that the prime minister intends to make the speech this week \u2013 possibly on Monday \u2013 if a resolution has been found to the Algerian hostage crisis. &quot;He wants to go ahead as soon as possible. There will be something in it which will pacify all but the hard core,&quot; said the source. &quot;But he could deliver the same kind of speech that Margaret Thatcher gave in Bruges in 1988 and around 25 MPs would not be happy. It is not possible to please everyone.&quot; Advanced briefing of his speech, which he had been scheduled to give in Amsterdam on Friday but had to postpone because of events in Algeria, made clear that he would demand repatriation of some powers from Brussels to Westminster if he wins a majority at the next election. The new deal would then be put to the British people in a referendum. Journalists were told that he would speak of &quot;growing frustration&quot; with the EU among UK voters which needs to be addressed if this country is not to slide towards the EU exit door. But insiders say he will spell out in greater detail his approach \u2013 including one significant announcement \u2013 while refusing to give a &quot;shopping list&quot; of powers he wants to repatriate. The shopping list idea was rejected after warnings from other EU leaders, Number 10 officials and the Foreign Office that he would have no guarantee of bringing home the goods. It is understood that he foresees a two-stage approach to renegotiation. In the short term he is expected to hold out the prospect of limited progress on issues that do not require reopening EU treaties. These would include shielding the UK from any adverse effects of the nascent Banking Union being planned among eurozone member states and opting out of elements of police and justice co-operation, while remaining involved in others. The idea of the UK demanding a short-term reopening of the EU treaties is understood to have been ruled out when the other EU states are preoccupied with creating an effective fiscal union. However, Cameron believes the second phase of renegotiation may be possible if and when the EU as a whole announces a full-blown intergovernmental conference, which in all probability would not begin until 2015 at the earliest. Many EU leaders say, however, that they see no need for such a conference. On Saturday, in a sign of further trouble ahead, veteran eurosceptic Bill Cash said any attempt to recast existing treaties to suit the UK would not work, not least because other member states would not meet most of Cameron&apos;s demands: &quot;We will have to leave the existing treaties in favour of a new treaty creating a new political and trade agreement, something similar to the arrangements the Swiss enjoy.&quot; Cameron&apos;s policy is not only splitting the Tory party but increasingly business opinion seems divided. Several business figures \u2013 including Lord Browne, the former BP boss \u2013 warned last week that the prime minister was endangering future investment in this country by offering a referendum several years down the road. But in an article for the Observer published on theguardian.com, the director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, says Cameron&apos;s policy of &quot;renegotiation and referendum&quot; is the correct one. &quot;Britain&apos;s businesspeople are not keen on walking out of the European exit door, but recognise that in a negotiation all options have to remain on the table,&quot; he says. &quot;That means having the courage to take tough decisions and facing the consequences at the ballot box.&quot;", "sentences": ["It is not possible to please everyone.&quot; Advanced briefing of his speech, which he had been scheduled to give in Amsterdam on Friday but had to postpone because of events in Algeria, made clear that he would demand repatriation of some powers from Brussels to Westminster if he wins a majority at the next election."], "title": "Cameron's keynote speech on EU will contain 'red-meat announcement'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/19/david-cameron-keynote-speech-europe", "tags": ["David Cameron", "European Union", "Conservatives", "Europe", "Politics", "World news", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-20T17:20:04Z", "article": "David Cameron won the support of one of the Conservative party&apos;s leading Eurosceptics on Sunday as it emerged that the prime minister will deliver his long-awaited and once-postponed referendum speech before the end of the week. Liam Fox, the former defence secretary and one of the party&apos;s most vocal critics of Brussels, said he had been briefed on the contents of the speech and was &quot;broadly satisfied&quot; with what Cameron was intending to say. &quot;If that is the speech that is finally delivered, a great many of us will think that it&apos;s a speech that we&apos;ve been waiting a long time for any prime minister to deliver,&quot; Fox said. Cameron originally floated the idea of using his speech to the Conservative party conference last year to make a big announcement about Europe. Then a separate speech was promised before Christmas but that got delayed. After eventually being scheduled for last Friday in Amsterdam, it was postponed at the last minute because of the Algerian crisis. William Hague, the foreign secretary, said on Sunday that the speech would take place before the end of this week. The date and the time will be announced on Monday. Given that Tuesday and Thursday have already apparently been ruled out and the publication of growth figures that could show the UK heading back towards recession are due to be published on Friday, Wednesday seems the most likely day. Cameron is still keen to deliver the speech abroad, but it is not clear whether this will be feasible. Some extracts have already been released from the speech, which will set out Cameron&apos;s determination to renegotiate Britain&apos;s relationship with the EU and to put the result to the people in a referendum after the 2015 election. But it remains to be seen what he will say about the extent of the renegotiation he hopes to achieve or the mechanics of the proposed referendum. In an interview on the BBC&apos;s Sunday Politics, Fox, who said that he was bound by a duty of confidentiality not to disclose the contents of the speech, said he personally wanted to see Britain revert to a &quot;basic economic relationship&quot; with the EU. If Cameron failed to achieve a major repatriation of powers, Fox said he would vote to leave the EU in the referendum that would follow. &quot;If the choice for me was between going in the current direction, which, let&apos;s face it, is towards ever closer union and ultimately a greater and greater loss of British sovereignty, my personal preference would be to leave,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t want to have ever closer union, I don&apos;t want to be European first and British second.&quot; Broadcaster Michael Portillo, a leading Conservative Eurosceptic in the 1990s, told Sky News that he thought Cameron was making a mistake in offering a referendum when he personally was in favour of keeping Britain in the EU. &quot;To commit himself to an in-out referendum in the midterm of his next government seems to me to be extraordinarily dangerous,&quot; said Portillo. &quot;People like to kick their government in the teeth.&quot; Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said Cameron should hold a referendum before the general election because it was &quot;doubtful&quot; that the Conservatives would win it. Farage said that although there would be no national Ukip pact with Cameron&apos;s party in 2015, he could imagine local Ukip branches deciding not to run candidates against Conservatives who were particularly Eurosceptic.", "sentences": ["After eventually being scheduled for last Friday in Amsterdam, it was postponed at the last minute because of the Algerian crisis."], "title": "David Cameron's Europe speech 'to be delivered this week'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/20/david-cameron-europe-speech-delivered", "tags": ["David Cameron", "Politics", "Liam Fox", "UK Independence party (Ukip)", "Foreign policy", "European Union", "Europe", "World news", "UK news", "Conservatives"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-21T12:40:03Z", "article": "Britons&apos; travel plans are being heavily disrupted by the ongoing wintry conditions, including one in 10 flights being cancelled at Heathrow airport, icy roads and long delays on the railways. Here is a guide to your rights when facing delays. My flight has been delayed. Can I get compensation? Airlines don&apos;t have to pay out for delays caused by snow because weather is classified as an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot; \u2013 though some airlines may issue a refund at their discretion. According to Which?, you can challenge your airline if you don&apos;t agree there were extraordinary circumstances \u2013 for example, if you are told you can&apos;t fly due to the snow, but other flights are departing. &quot;Airlines may stretch the definition of extraordinary circumstances further than they should,&quot; Which? states. If the delay is not caused by extraordinary circumstances you will be entitled to compensation under EU rules, but only if you are flying with an airline based in the EU or with a non-EU-based airline flying from an EU airport, and only if the delay is for two hours or more. If you are flying somewhere else or with a non-EU-based airline not flying from the EU you&apos;ll have to check that carrier&apos;s terms and conditions. If you are delayed for two hours or more you are entitled to: two free phone calls, faxes or e-mails; free food and drinks; and free hotel accommodation if you need to stay overnight. If your flight arrives at its destination three hours or more late you will receive compensation of between \u20ac250 and \u20ac600, depending on how far your flight takes you. So you&apos;ll get \u20ac250 if your three hour-delayed flight travels 1,500km or less (ie, London to Amsterdam), but \u20ac600 if your plane is delayed by four hours or more and travels at least 3,500km (ie, London to Sydney). My flight has been cancelled. Will I get my money back? If your flight is cancelled you should be offered either a refund or an alternative flight to your original destination. For compensation you will have to look to the EU rules again, though if the delay is caused by snow \u2013 and thus an extraordinary circumstance \u2013 you might not get anything. If you are covered by EU regulations you will be entitled to travel assistance (such as help with rebooking for a later date) as well as meals and accommodation etc. Check the official EU website for more on your rights. I&apos;ve just bought a car breakdown policy and I&apos;m already stuck \u2013 can I get help? Both Green Flag and the AA will pick up customers who have broken down the second they take out cover \u2013 but both only offer the most basic services for at least 24 hours. The AA&apos;s roadside assistance policy allows for instant pick-up, but its more expensive Relay policy requires customers to have held the policy for 24 hours before claiming. Similarly, if you take out a Green Flag policy you will be granted &quot;level 1 cover&quot; only for the first day, which entitles you to roadside assistance and/or local recovery to a garage of your choice up to 10 miles away. If you take out a higher level of cover, the rest of your benefits (ie, national recovery or home call) will kick in 24 hours later. I haven&apos;t got roadside assistance. What happens if I break down? The AA and Green Flag will both pick you up if you do not have any cover \u2013 but it will be more expensive than had you bought a policy. The AA will recover anyone, but you must take out an annual policy at the point of rescue \u2013 the AA said someone requiring a full vehicle recovery must thus buy an annual Relay policy at a premium of about \u00a370-80. Green Flag will rescue you instantly for a charge of \u00a3108 \u2013 this entitles you to roadside assistance and/or local recovery to a garage of your choice up to 10 miles away, or to a garage of its choice \u2013 but you will not have to take out an annual policy; instead the \u00a3108 is a one-off charge for rescue. I&apos;ve had an accident due to ice on the road. Can I sue the council? If the accident was caused by a pothole that had been reported to the council, you might be able to make a claim \u2013 but ice is a different matter. &quot;At minus five degrees salt gradually becomes less effective, and at minus nine degrees it doesn&apos;t work at all,&quot; says Ian Crowder of the AA. &quot;So if you&apos;re out driving in those conditions it comes down to personal responsibility, but it&apos;s a grey area regardless.&quot; You will also be reponsible for any damage in the eyes of your car insurer. &quot;Insurers call it a no-claims bonus not a no-blame bonus,&quot; Crowder says. &quot;Drivers have to take responsibility if they choose to drive on icy roads, as no one had forced them to get in their cars.&quot; Can I claim a refund if my train is delayed by snow and ice? Yes. While there are rules on compensation set out in the Conditions of Carriage (a miserly 20% of a single ticket or 10% of a return \u2013 unless there were delays on both legs \u2013 if you are over an hour late) each train operating company has its own rules that are far more generous than the official minimum. As a general rule, companies will refund 50% of your ticket for a delay of 30 minutes or more, and will double that if the delay is for an hour or longer. Check each company&apos;s Passenger Charter for further details of its compensation scheme. Atoc has links to every train operating companies&apos; own website. My tube has been delayed. Can I claim? Yes. Transport for London offers refunds if a passenger&apos;s journey is delayed by more than 15 minutes. For tube passengers this amounts to the fare for the single journey you were making, whether you have a season ticket or purchased a single fare. London Overground users get the same, but only when their train is delayed by more than 30 minutes. You must claim within 14 days to be eligible for a refund, and it usually takes 21 days to process. If you haven&apos;t heard after 21 days contact Oyster Customer Service Centre. Freedom Pass and other free travel pass-holders are not entitled to refunds. Will my online shopping arrive tonight? Tesco says all its home delivery services, including groceries, wine and clothing, are subject to delays due to the snow. Similarly, Ocado says the severe weather may affect its deliveries, while Asda says the weather &quot;may cause disruptions to home delivery&quot;. Will I be entitled to compensation if my shopping is late? No. Most retailers state in their terms and conditions that they are not liable for missing a delivery slot. For example, Tesco states: &quot;While we make every effort to deliver all your goods in the agreed time, we will not be liable if we fail to do so in part or in full due to circumstances beyond our control.&quot; But if the bad weather does cause it to miss a slot, your retailer will attempt to arrange an alternative time and should issue a refund if you no longer require your shopping. An Asda spokeswoman said it had had to cancel some deliveries &quot;in more remote parts and some [areas] that had main road closures&quot;, but added it is already &quot;catching up&quot; on those. It is allowing people to collect their groceries in-store and is even arranging mutually accessible points for customers to meet drivers.", "sentences": ["So you&apos;ll get \u20ac250 if your three hour-delayed flight travels 1,500km or less (ie, London to Amsterdam), but \u20ac600 if your plane is delayed by four hours or more and travels at least 3,500km (ie, London to Sydney)."], "title": "Travel delays and snow disruption: your consumer rights", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jan/21/travel-delays-snow-disruption-your-consumer-rights", "tags": ["Consumer rights", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Travel", "Air transport", "World news", "Snow", "Weather", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-21T12:43:47Z", "article": "David Cameron will deliver his long-awaited speech on the future of Britain in Europe in central London on Wednesday morning, Downing Street has announced.

Chief executive Stewart Wingate wrote to the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, asking for a meeting to bring together London&apos;s three main airports to work out how to avoid the chaos at Heathrow &quot;due to small amounts of snow&quot;. Wingate said: &quot;It just cannot be right that passengers are being asked to accept apologies for pre-emptive flight cancellations. Huge numbers of business meetings and holidays will have been impacted and misery caused to travellers. The over-scheduling of flights at Heathrow during the winter period should stop. &quot;I am proposing that for the key winter months of December, January and February Heathrow declares a level of capacity that it can cope with in winter conditions.

Heathrow&apos;s demand and capacity balancing group, Hadacab, decided last Thursday to press ahead without general cuts to flights. which led to many passengers boarding planes on Friday that never took off, causing many hours of frustration. A meeting on Saturday saw 20% of the following day&apos;s flights cancelled, and about 120 of Monday&apos;s flights were cancelled amid fears for visibility in forecast freezing fog. At Monday&apos;s midday meeting, with runways and taxiways clear, Hadacab decided against further cancellations for Tuesday. Gatwick, with 5cm of snow, prides itself on not having cancelled any flights for its own operational reasons, although airline troubles elsewhere in Europe disrupted its schedules. London&apos;s second airport puts this down to better planning and an \u00a38m investment in snow-clearing machines that sweep the runway in 10 minutes. A spokesperson said: &quot;Snow is not an unexpected event. Everyone knows what their actions and responsibilities are and those plans went into place on Friday morning.&quot; Heathrow&apos;s snow plans have been beefed up under an operations chief, Normand Boivin, headhunted in 2011 from Montreal airport, which sees over 2m of snowfall in an average winter. The airport also boasts \u00a336m of new snow kit and claims to be the only one in the UK with a dedicated Met Office forecaster in residence. But the chief difference is that 10 minutes to sweep a runway is time Heathrow does not have. Forced runway closures for clearance started the worst of Friday&apos;s backlog: since, though, the runways and approaches have been clear. Visibility instead has been the bigger problem, with air traffic controllers requiring a bigger gap between planes landing or taking off. For an airport that operated last year at 99.2% capacity, a matter of seconds in each flight interval can cascade into long bottlenecks.           &quot;Many airports have plenty of spare runway capacity so aircraft can be spaced out more during low visibility without causing delays and cancellations. Because Heathrow operates at almost full capacity, there is simply no room to reschedule the delayed flights,&quot; a Heathrow spokesman said. A DfT spokeswoman said: &quot;The UK&apos;s airports sector has learned many lessons from their experience in 2010, and this has allowed them to reduce the level of disruption significantly this year. We will expect them to continue to learn lessons and we will ensure they are as well prepared as possible. &quot;In the longer term, the Airports Commission will recommend how best to meet the UK&apos;s aviation capacity and connectivity needs and will consider the full range of options, including both short- and long-term measures.&quot; According to a boss of another UK airport, who once worked at Heathrow: &quot;As soon as they say we&apos;re clearing one runway, there is no resilience. You can close one of five runways at Amsterdam, but here, even for 20 minutes, it means they&apos;ve gone bust. They&apos;re in a very constrained environment, and to get these great big snow-clearing machines around the aircraft without hitting them or other units is a very tricky job. The deicer will only last for half an hour or so and with gridlock on the taxiway, the whole thing becomes more and more complicated.&quot; Heathrow&apos;s cancellation strategy is strongly dictated by British Airways, the largest carrier, which took much of the weekend flak. Early decisions to cancel have been compared favourably by some to the policy of London City airport, which only announced its decision to close altogether on Saturday in the afternoon. Yet most observers feel Heathrow has got its act together after December 2010, when hundreds of thousands of passengers&apos; travel planes were disrupted by just one hour&apos;s snowfall and more than 4,000 flights were cancelled over four days.But the fundamental problem is, as Heathrow admits, the sheer volume of planes. Given that snow is an annual winter event, has the airport bitten off more than it can chew? The other airport boss sympathises: &quot;Is it them being greedy, or airlines wanting every ounce of capacity when they can? Either it turns away business every day, which would be crazy, or waits to deal with the problems that brings. It&apos;s a tough call.&quot;", "sentences": ["You can close one of five runways at Amsterdam, but here, even for 20 minutes, it means they&apos;ve gone bust."], "title": "Gatwick boss wants Heathrow to cut number of flights in winter months", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/21/gatwick-boss-heathrow-flights-winter", "tags": ["Transport", "Weather", "Snow", "Air transport", "UK news", "World news", "Transport policy", "Politics", "Airline industry", "Business", "Consumer affairs", "Money"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-25T21:00:08Z", "article": "Carl Andre&apos;s bricks were denounced by the Mirror as &quot;a load of rubbish&quot; (I&apos;m a hopeless drawer, 24 January) and most people probably think art has no affect on society.

Cancer is rampant. You&apos;re barely a chapter in before a tumour erupts or a lymphatic system turns nasty. Young heroes and heroines are terminal from page one, or a friend is, or a parent. The shadow of premature death has fallen upon the genre: one half-expects Waterstones to be staffed by Macmillan nurses. It is axiomatic (though wrong) that teenagers will read only books that reflect teenage experience. It is blithely asserted, for instance, that their hunger for dystopian fiction is whetted by having to live in a bleak world under the pitiless authority of adults. Is cancer, likewise, a metaphor for the incurable cruelty of being young? Perhaps, but I doubt it. I suspect that the real reason for the pandemic is that cancer is an exceedingly convenient subject for teen authors. Sex and death, the magnetic poles of fiction, attract us children&apos;s writers no less than adult authors, but we have to be more leery of their pull. We have gatekeepers to sneak past \u2013 and we have a &quot;sense of responsibility&quot;, of course. Cancer is handy because it is all-permissive. Sex is omnipresent in teenage cancer novels, and who dare complain? How cruel to insist on virginity in the face of death: it would be perverse of us not to write scenes of last-chance deflowering. Teen authors love to flirt with taboo, to grapple \u2013 sensitively \u2013 with dark and frightening issues, and there is nothing darker and more frightening than cancer. Approximately 16 out of every 100,000 children contract a form of the disease in the US, of whom three will die of it. Each of these tragedies will spread a wider circle of pain, of course, but the fact is that child cancer is comparatively rare and affects relatively few young people. Teenagers see it, correctly, as a horror visited mostly on adults. It is not, therefore, a real and present danger in the way that bullying, sexual humiliation, peer-group rejection and parental severance are. So cancer is not a dangerous subject \u2013 it&apos;s a safe one. It allows teen authors to wax emotive without being threatening. It allows us to appear to be brave (&quot;unflinching&quot; is the usual term) taboo-busters while jerking tears for all we&apos;re worth. The surprising thing is that so many teenage cancer novels are very good. John Green&apos;s The Fault in Our Stars, recently published by Penguin, was voted Time Magazine&apos;s book of the year in 2012 ahead of Hilary Mantel and Zadie Smith. (It also initiated a recent Daily Mail broadside against &quot;sick lit&quot;, which earned that august organ an online drubbing.) Green is an uber-presence on the net with a vast and adoring following. The Fault in Our Stars is about two young people dying of cancer. Hazel, the narrator, is permanently connected\u00a0to an oxygen tank because her lungs are packing up. Augustus, with whom she falls in love at a support-group meeting, has already lost a leg to the osteosarcoma that will soon consume the rest of him. Green is indeed unflinching when it comes to the manifestations of their conditions, and this may be why the novel has been praised for its realism. This is wide of the mark and something of an injustice. The Fault in Our Stars is not realistic: it is a very smart artifice. Much as I would love to meet teenagers such as Hazel and Gus, I fear I never shall, for surely such erudite, witty, philosophical, generous, courageous and doomed young people never walked the earth, let alone Indianapolis. Hazel knows Eliot&apos;s The\u00a0Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock by heart, and in an emergency can recite William Carlos Williams. Kierkegaard would have welcomed Gus as an apprentice. The Fault in Our Stars is a masterclass in how to have your cake and eat it. It&apos;s a tear-jerker; if you check the teenage postings on any of Green&apos;s sites, your screen will drip. It skates nimbly on thin ice (terminally ill kids having sex after a visit to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam would be too portentous or vulgar for most writers), while being knowingly ironic about what it&apos;s doing. And it&apos;s complicatedly self-referential: Hazel and Gus have travelled to Holland to meet Peter Van Houten, the author of their favourite novel in which, needless to say, the heroine dies of cancer. In the flesh, he&apos;s a boorish drunk who disabuses them of the notion that characters in a book have\u00a0any existence beyond the last\u00a0page. The Fault in Our Stars is a very smart\u00a0book. &quot;Smart&quot;, in American usage, is slicker and sharper than &quot;intelligent&quot;; faster off the mark and quicker on its feet than deep thought. The problem with smartness is that it\u00a0tends towards dubious aphorism, eg\u00a0&quot;Some infinities are bigger than other infinities&quot; (one should regard the plural of infinity with the same suspicion as the collective noun for hermits). Nonetheless, The Fault in Our\u00a0Stars is the second-best teenage cancer novel I&apos;ve read (the best being\u00a0Anthony McGowan&apos;s Falstaffian\u00a0comedy Henry Tumour). And though I&apos;d like to think that we&apos;re\u00a0going into remission, I doubt it. When film-makers are through with dystopia, I imagine they&apos;ll pick up on cancer.

The scrapbooks, thought to have been made by her father Otto, are held in the archives of the Anne Frank Fund and their release, with rare film footage, letters and pictures, is intended to give a broader picture of the Frank family. &quot;Anne&apos;s father was a keen amateur photographer, something that was more unusual at that time, and we have hundreds of images, mainly of special family occasions, but of friends too,&quot; said Yves Kugelmann, who sits on the board of the fund. A photo of Anne with her elder sister and parents out together in May 1941 near their home in Amsterdam is a poignant reminder of the freedom they lost, while a jaunty image of Anne, taken by her sister Margot, shows her leaning over the balcony of a block of flats and letting her hair fly. The picture was meant to include their grandmother, Rosa, but a note in the scrapbook explains that she moved out of the way at the last moment. Original documents, diary pages and footage are all included in the first app edition of The Diary of a Young Girl, the journal written by the teenage Frank during the two years she spent concealed from the Nazis in an annexe behind a warehouse.

Photograph:  /Anne Frank Fonds Basel    The content of the app is drawn from archives held in Basel, Switzerland, where Otto Frank lived after the war, and has been assembled with the help of Frank&apos;s only surviving direct relative, Bernd Elias, known as Buddy. &quot;I am happy to say that interest in Anna and her times is still strong, but bringing out this now is highly important for the future of her story,&quot; Elias told the Observer. &quot;The new material gives it a completely different outlook.&quot; In childhood Anne&apos;s elder cousin, Buddy, was the object of her dreams. Inside the annexe at Prinsengracht 263 she drew a picture of the outfit that she hoped to wear one day when she went ice-skating with him. Now 87, Elias works with the Anne Frank Foundation and is still committed to explaining the relevance of his cousin&apos;s story. &quot;It is a great thing that we have so much material available now for young people,&quot; he said. &quot;In the past there was only the diary, now there are pictures and videos. Hatred, of course, and racism are still working away all over the world. They are with us. It is so important that children learn to respect all religions and all nationalities.&quot; Tens of millions have read The Diary of a Young Girl since it was first published in 1947; readers of the app can now see the hiding place she shared from 6 July 1942 until 4 August 1944 with her parents, her sister, the Van Pels family and a dentist called Fritz Pfeffer. Importantly for Kugelmann and Elias, the app also shows what was happening outside the annexe. While Helena Bonham Carter reads Anne&apos;s diary entries, users can watch videos of those who secretly helped the threatened Jewish family, or listen to original radio news broadcasts. &quot;When I knew Anne, she was a girl like every other girl,&quot; said Elias. &quot;She was lovely and wild and we had a wonderful time playing together. But she was no real exception, although it is true that she just loved writing, even before she was in hiding. In a way, she was not somebody special, though. That was the point really.&quot; Although Frank was &quot;great fun&quot;, Elias often thinks of the rest of her family too. &quot;We know about Anne because of her writing, yet no one knows about her sister. Sometimes I can&apos;t believe that she went then too. And I know that Otto felt that. Margot was highly intelligent and was always the best in her class. Anne was one victim of millions, and all these victims were each people with their own characters.&quot; Elias feels Anne&apos;s wider importance now is as the best known Holocaust victim. &quot;She has become an icon of that time, and now I think about her every day because of my work. I get mail sent to me almost every day and I answer them all.&quot; The Anne Frank Fund makes no profits and invests in education projects, so its commercial ventures are carefully chosen. Elias believes his cousin&apos;s legacy is liable to exploitation. &quot;I hated to see the musical. She is used sometimes for things that are not right. There were even some Anne Frank jeans at one time. Horrible ideas.&quot; At the same time it is &quot;heartwarming&quot;, Elias says, that she is read all over the world. Penguin General&apos;s app also includes 21 video clips from the Oscar-winning documentary Anne Frank Remembered and several audio recordings, including a commentary from Miep Gies, one of those who risked her life to help Anne. But schoolchildren will not, of course, be spared the last chapter of Frank&apos;s story. Her time in hiding ended on a summer&apos;s day when the Austrian Nazi SS Oberscharf\u00fchrer Karl Silberbauer entered the annexe.

When I went there two years ago large parts of it and the surrounding land still hadn&apos;t recovered from a series of spills of Shell oil that had taken place in 2004. Most Goi people had been farmers and fishermen, but they had mostly moved out because the water, the houses, the mud in the creeks all still reeked of crude. I had met Eric Dooh whose family comes from Goi, and who has spent years fighting Shell for compensation. This week he&apos;s in Amsterdam representing his father and on Wednesday, he and three other farmers from other parts of the polluted Niger delta will hear the verdict of a Dutch court on the case. Dooh and his colleagues have come to Europe because they say they cannot get justice in Nigeria. At stake is not just whether they get compensation from the Anglo-Dutch giant that made \u00a319bn profit last year, but whether Shell \u2013 and other multinationals \u2013 can be sued for pollution in the Netherlands. Behind Dooh stand possibly a long line of litigants and lawyers. Shell says the individual spills were caused by sabotage and under Nigerian law, oil companies are not liable to pay compensation for damage caused by sabotage spills. They also claim they had cleaned them up to the satisfaction of the Nigerian authorities, so they had no case to answer. But the reality is that despite condemnation by the UN Environment programme in 2011, despite Nigerian government promises, NGO fury and mounting despair in the communities, Shell&apos;s oil spills go on, the gas flaring continues and the people of the delta remain as poor as ever. Shell&apos;s whole network of thousands of miles of pipelines, flow stations and pump houses is corroding fast in the equatorial heat and rain. New figures on the company&apos;s Nigerian website shows that nearly 26,000 barrels of Shell oil was spilled last year from 200 spills in the delta. Of those, 144 were said to be due to people &quot;sabotage&quot; and people breaking into the pipes, but 55 came from &quot;operational mishaps&quot; \u2013 the admitted fault of the company. After 50 years of oil exploitation, pollution is now the norm on the delta, and the companies working there appear de-sensitised and immune to criticism. Over 50 spills a year in Canada or Mexico, Australia or Britain would be an outrage and draw political fury; but in the delta this is considered normal, or even better than usual. No other region of the world has to endure so much pollution on a regular basis. The fact is that western oil companies apply different standards to clean-ups and compensation in Nigeria compared with the rest of the world. I talked to people on the delta this week ahead of the Dutch verdict. They told me that nothing has changed in the past few years, even that the pollution was getting worse. According to them, the oil companies and the Nigerian government do not just fail to meet their own standards, but that the process of investigation, reporting and clean-up is deeply flawed in favour of the firms and against the victims. &quot;Spills in the US are responded to in minutes; in the Niger delta, which suffers more pollution each year than the Gulf of Mexico, it can take companies weeks or more&quot;, one said. Shell likes to claim that nearly all its spills in the delta are as a result of sabotage and crude theft. But there is increasing evidence that the greatest thefts comes not from the villagers and farmers of the delta but from sophisticated rackets with organised gangs at the heart of local and even national government and the military stealing and spilling on a massive scale. The communities admit they do take oil from Shell, and that they set up small local refineries. But they argue that they do it to survive, and they accuse Shell of &quot;ecocide&quot;. &quot;Our people are displaced by spills, we have reduced life expectancy and no livelihoods,&quot; Dooh said. The verdict is due tomorrow. It may change the life of people of Goi and other polluted villages who came to Europe to make their case, but that&apos;s a long way from cleaning up the whole delta.", "sentences": ["This week he&apos;s in Amsterdam representing his father and on Wednesday, he and three other farmers from other parts of the polluted Niger delta will hear the verdict of a Dutch court on the case."], "title": "Shell verdict will determine whether other firms could be tried for oil spills | John Vidal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/jan/29/shell-oil-spills-niger-delta", "tags": ["Oil spills", "Oil", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Environment", "Oil and gas companies", "Energy industry", "Business", "Oil", "Nigeria", "Africa", "World news", "Royal Dutch Shell", "Natural resources and development", "Global development"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-01-29T18:03:09Z", "article": "My mentor and friend Barbara Christie, who has died aged 66 after suffering from cancer, was a remarkable maker of contemporary jewellery and an influential teacher. For more than 30 years she headed the jewellery department at Morley College, London, as well as nurturing first-year students at Central Saint Martins, and establishing a loyal following at West Dean college in West Sussex, where she would conclude her popular introductory slide talks with the words: &quot;Fruit for thought!&quot; \u2013 a malapropism often echoed. Barbara was fascinated by unusual gemstones. Her work became more and more colourful over the years, and Barbara began to commission stones to be cut especially for her. Although difficult to categorise, her work was always wearable: even dramatic, larger pieces, such as the magnificent gold and druze quartz necklace made for the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths&apos; fabulous Gold: Power and Allure exhibition of 2012, are comfortable to wear and have fastenings that are easy to manage. Barbara&apos;s work is in public collections including that of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths and the American Craft Museum, New York, and was worn by high-profile customers such as Madeleine Albright, the former US secretary of state. Born Barbara Crouwel in Amsterdam, she came to London in 1969 to work as an au pair. She met and, in 1971, married the architect George Christie. After training as a jeweller at the Sir John Cass School of Art, Design and Manufacture, she worked initially as an apprentice with the artist Susanna Heron. Formidably glamorous and full of energy, Barbara took a disciplined approach to her work. Her studio was in west London, upstairs in the house which she and George bought in a derelict condition and transformed into a beautiful home crowded with Barbara&apos;s collections of artefacts, George&apos;s wonderful paintings, and photographs of their daughter, Liza, and adored grandchildren, Georgie and Joseph.     A piece of Barbara Christie's jewellery    I would arrive for work as her studio assistant at 9am to find that she had cleaned the house, done the shopping, written five birthday cards, taken her cat to the beauty parlour, solved several problems on the telephone, had coffee with a friend, pre-prepared lunch and arranged a dinner party. Then she would get to her bench, with coffee and cake at hand, and work until 6pm with absolute concentration. Barbara enjoyed the dialogue between wearer and maker, and as a result she would sell directly to clients and did not often exhibit. However, a touring retrospective of her work, Light Seeping Through Windows,can be seen at Contemporary Applied Arts in London until 2 March 2013.

Okay, Resistance: Retribution was okay, and some of the Call of Duty and Medal of Honor titles have just about scraped by on PSP and DS. But nothing really memorable, nothing that stood up as something that added to a series. Killzone: Mercenary is aiming to be different. It wants to exist beside its home console brethren as an equal. &quot;The key challenge was, can we make a true Killzone game on a handheld? Is that possible?&quot; says Hermen Hulst, co-founder of Guerrilla, the Dutch studio behind the benchmark PlayStation shooter series. &quot;You want a console-grade experience but also you want a bespoke game designed for the platform. Mercenary is very high-paced, it&apos;s very chaotic. That&apos;s what we aimed for. I think that&apos;s working out okay!&quot; Set in and around the time period of Killzones 1 and 2, Mercenary follows Arran Danner, an ex-UCN solder now carrying out paid missions for the Phantom Talon Corp. Crucially, he doesn&apos;t care what side he works for as long as he gets the cash, so the campaign mode will feature missions where you&apos;re fighting alongside the glowy-eyed Helghast \u2013 the baddies of the Killzone series. From this standpoint however, Danner will apparently discover some rather uncomfortable truths about this intergalactic war and the alleged good guys, the ISA.      The game has been built around the Killzone 3 engine, and it seems few graphical concessions have been made in the change to an ostensibly less powerful platform. &quot;We were quite surprised,&quot; says Thomas Jones, the art director at Guerrilla Cambridge where much of the work is being done on Mercenary. &quot;The Vita screen is so sharp and the fidelity is really high. One of the mistakes we made when we started was to down-rez everything too much. We realised, actually, we&apos;re going to have to put more polys and textures back in. Obviously we had to take into account the smaller characters, making sure they stand out on the smaller screen, particularly in multiplayer. But the room is there to cram more in.&quot; During a demo session for the game, we start out trying the multiplayer. It&apos;s a conventional set-up offering six maps and three modes. We&apos;re in Guerrilla Warfare mode, which is basically Team Deathmatch. Up to eight players can take part at once, which is definitely enough for the smaller display, but not too few to leave you wandering the locations looking for action. The demo map is Shoreline, a small network of caves and tunnels, opening out onto a cliff edge with narrow walkways and a guard tower. There are lots of little alcoves to hide in, but really this is a circuit-based run-and-gun warzone and its fun, highly competitive stuff. Landscapes have plenty of detail, the framerate feels smooth, and firefights are super-intense, perhaps because the handheld screen makes everything feel more compact and urgent. Whatever, it works. At the outset, players are offered a series of class set-ups \u2013 a familiar range of assault, sniper and heavy gunner roles, all customisable. During the action there are also regular care package, sorry, &apos;Van-Guard&apos; drops, which supply the first player to reach them with a special weapon for a limited time. Among the armoury is the Sky Fury, a targeted air strike, and the Porcupine, a rocket launcher which locks on to targets \u2013 you can then tap the screen to take them out. My favourite though is the Mantis, a remote control drone that can sneak up on players and stab them in the neck. Lovely.      It&apos;s not the only new system that will remind gamers of other titles. Mercenary also introduces Valour cards, effectively large floating playing card icons dropped by each player when they die. The suit represents the player&apos;s class and load-outs, while the rank from two to ace represents where they sit on the leaderboards. Picking up a card earns you cash and later there are large bonuses for accruing a complete suit, or a whole pack of 52. Interestingly, the value of multiplayer victories degrades over time so the leaderboards are dynamic, giving more players the chance to be king-of-the-hill for a week or so, rather than allowing one super player to get to the top and stay there. Match stats and heat maps of recent encounters will also be available, and any cash earned in multiplayer can be used in the the campaign \u2013 and vice-versa. Guerrilla is also using the Vita Party app to allow friends to quickly find each other and set up online fights. As you&apos;d expect from a console loaded with input options, the controls feel good; certainly good enough for a handheld platform. The two analogue sticks give you the traditional console FPS experience, and while it takes a few matches to get used to the very fine sensitivity, you&apos;re soon using the Vita layout like a Dual Shock pounding through landscapes, checking corners, swirling to catch players sneaking up behind. The touchscreen interaction is just right. Getting in close enough for a melee kill brings up an arrow icon on the screen: drag your finger across quickly enough and you&apos;ll perform a silent takedown. However, if your intended victim performs the same move quicker, he can parry and counter. It&apos;s a bit of a gimmick but it&apos;s solidly implemented and not too intrusive. Far better is the use of the rear touchpad to sprint. Double tapping and then keeping a finger on the pad makes your avatar run, and its a seamless experience that frees up the button array for other stuff. The rear pad can also be used to zoom in on your sniper scope, while the tilt controls let you fine tune the aiming; it&apos;s a really neat, intuitive option.      Elsewhere, the single-player campaign apparently offers around 6-8 hours of gameplay. I tried two missions: Lightning Strike and The Package. In the former, you attack a Helghast ion cannon base and take control of the huge space guns, while the latter has you escorting the son of an important embassador to an extraction point, through waves of enemy troops. I was less convinced by these than by the multiplayer. Robbed of the majesty that comes with a 40-inch display and hi-res textures, the barren wastelands and industrial complexes of the Killzone universe look rather lifeless, and there were too many obvious choke points that had to be cleared of several enemy waves before progress could be made. Also, there was a hacking mini-game. Hacking mini-games are almost universally horrible.  There&apos;s good stuff though \u2013 the AI has been built upon from previous episodes and computer controlled enemies are now really sneaky. They&apos;ll flank you, they&apos;ll shimmy across the floor to stay out of site, they&apos;ll creep up behind you. Piers Jackson, the manager of the Cambridge studio promises a more open structure to many missions. There are glimpses of freedom in Lightning Strike, where larger environments provide a range of alternative routes; Jackson hopes this will lead to more of a sandbox feel with a much more interesting set of foes. &quot;One of the features we wanted in Mercenary was the ability to play stealthily, to move through the environment unseen,&quot; he explains. &quot;So we&apos;ve added on systems to the more patrol-orientated gameplay of the enemies: how the AI reacts to bullet fire, to noise in the environment, what happens if they find a corpse, and the search behaviours that come out of that. How they move round the environment to find the player... these are all extensions to the AI system.&quot; This unpredictable behaviour adds variety and excitement where the pallid locations and formulaic structure seem to let it down. Still, this is only two missions, and we&apos;re yet to scratch the surface of Danners story; certainly The Package hints at some pretty astonishing cyberpunk city environments, with towering buildings and labyrinthine neon-drenched road ways. Plus, there could be some huge surprises to come as we get to see the Helghan side of the conflict.      Mercenary then, is already looking impressive. It&apos;s fast, it feels robust and it squishes in pretty much everything we expect from a modern shooter. I&apos;m hoping the promise of a very different storyline means we&apos;ll get a greater diversity of locations in the campaign, but multiplayer is certainly functioning better than most other handheld shooters. And according to Hulst, this is just the beginning. I ask about the future of the Killzone series, and whether we could perhaps see, say, a Kill Zone 4 that works across console and handheld as a pervasive experience. He doesn&apos;t bat the question away quite as quickly as I expected. &quot;From a developer perspective and as a technologist, I think that&apos;s hugely exciting. It&apos;s also not a trivial undertaking. This game is very much designed as a standalone project, but as a future potential, I&apos;m very open to these ideas. As long as it&apos;s done right.&quot; But Guerrilla has always been a studio obsessed with the cold hard promise of technology. If it is possible, if it is on PlayStation, it will probably happen here. Killzone: Mercenary is due out on Vita on 17 September in the US and 20 September in the UK.

Ministers of all political colours like to link a rise in the country&apos;s place in the various worldwide rankings as testament to their policies, while falls generally get written off as the result of the last government&apos;s failed ideas. There is undoubtedly material for more or less any argument from the different studies: the most recent 65-nation Pisa study, conducted by the OECD, put England 23rd in reading, 27th in maths and 16th in science; data from the Amsterdam-based International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) put England 11th out of 45 nations for reading, with similar rankings for maths and science; while a newer league table by the Economist Intelligence Unit for publisher Pearson had England 6th of 40 nations. A study for the leading educational charity the Sutton Trust, carried out Professor Alan Smithers from Buckingham university, noted that some tables omitted countries deemed ahead of England elsewhere while others used data, for example on university graduation, not considered elsewhere. Small and effectively meaningless differences in raw data could still shift ranking positions and that different tables, it added. &quot;Global education tables have become an increasingly important tool in the political debate in Britain as well as in other developed nations. But league table rankings are not always what they seem, hence the see-sawing in the rankings that we have seen over the years,&quot; said Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust However, Smithers did find that once the differences were removed the main tables gave broadly similar results, with England generally out-performed by a small number of nations such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, and consistently by the East Asian nations, which traditionally top such rankings. While UK ministers have said the country should be emulating the likes of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea, Smithers said this might not be the most valuable model. He said: &quot;The superior performance of Asian pupils has been attributed to a culture of hard work and effort, the personality trait of quiet persistence, and distinctive parenting. &quot;After all, Chinese children also shine in England&apos;s education system. There may not be a magic bullet from these countries which can be incorporated into England&apos;s education system, and we may do better to look at those European countries that do well to learn the lessons of their success.&quot;", "sentences": ["There is undoubtedly material for more or less any argument from the different studies: the most recent 65-nation Pisa study, conducted by the OECD, put England 23rd in reading, 27th in maths and 16th in science; data from the Amsterdam-based International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) put England 11th out of 45 nations for reading, with similar rankings for maths and science; while a newer league table by the Economist Intelligence Unit for publisher Pearson had England 6th of 40 nations."], "title": "Global education league tables 'are not always what they seem'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/feb/01/global-education-league-tables-warning", "tags": ["School tables", "Education policy", "Education", "Politics", "Secondary schools", "Schools"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-02-01T17:17:32Z", "article": "According to leading photography curator Charlotte Cotton, the fashion photography of Viviane Sassen is creating &quot;an axis shift in the genre&quot;. This bold claim is made in the afterword of a big, new book called Viviane Sassen: In and Out of Fashion, which rounds up her work for style magazines such as Dazed and Confused, Self Service, Wallpaper and Purple over the past decade or so. On the evidence, it is hard to disagree with Cotton&apos;s summation: Sassen has dramatically changed the face of fashion photography in much the same way as Juergen Teller or Guy Bourdin did before her. But that is only half the story. Sassen is also that rare thing: a photographer whose work straddles the often mutually exclusive \u2013 but increasingly blurred \u2013 worlds of fashion and fine art. She has just published another acclaimed limited-edition art-photography book, Roxane, which, if you&apos;re quick, you can pick up online before it becomes a prohibitively expensive collector&apos;s item. In it, she photographs her &quot;muse&quot; in a variety of strange poses in strange landscapes. The photographs were taken over a number of years, and hint at the relationship between photographer and muse. Like much of Sassen&apos;s work, Roxane is beautifully strange and illustrates the almost sculptural nature of HER photographs, as well as their dreamlike quality \u2013 all those ultra-bright colours and odd postures.     Performative \u2026\u00a0Sassen's subjects hover between the sculptural and the dreamlike. Photograph: Viviane Sassen for Delamar    This undertow is also present in much of the fine-art photography she&apos;s made in Africa, where she has worked regularly since 2002. (She was born and is currently based in Amsterdam, but lived in Kenya as a young child between the ages of two and five.) Perhaps more than any of her contemporaries, she has undercut the received image of Africa as a continent of conflict, suffering and poverty. Instead, she has made an ongoing series of performative photographs in which her subjects seem to exist in a suspended state between waking and dreaming. In one image, shot at night, two girls hug each other around what looks like a large banana leaf; in another, a boy in an Adidas tracksuit sleeps cocooned in a wispy green fishing net. Sassen&apos;s approach to race is as oblique as her approach to sexuality or identity. In one striking image, an angular girl in a white shirt sits on a wall, her face so dark it appears at first glance to be a cutout. There is something surreal about Sassen&apos;s work, but the almost garish colours and angular shapes of Bourdin&apos;s photographs seem to be a touchstone too. In a recent interview with the British Journal of Photography, Sassen admitted that exhibiting fashion photography in a museum was &quot;problematic&quot;, adding perceptively: &quot;Art photography doesn&apos;t have to serve any purpose, fashion photography does, and that makes a difference. It&apos;s a kind of puzzle that has to be solved.&quot; She has done this by formally approaching each in a very different way. She uses a Mamiya 6x7 film camera for her art projects, and shoots in digital, often with a team of up to 40 assistants, for her fashion work. For each, she has developed a signature \u2013 though they often overlap.     Blurred lines \u2026\u00a0Sassen moves seamlessly between fashion and fine art. Photograph: Viviane Sassen for Pop    Right now, it is her fashion photography that is receiving most attention: the Prestel book, In and Out of Fashion, is essentially a catalogue for a retrospective show of the same name at the Huis Marseille Museum of Photography until 17 March. I much prefer her art photography, especially when it shades into surreal documentary style. In one of her earlier books, the now sought-after Die Son Sien Alles, she photographed makeshift shops and businesses in Cape Town shanty towns, capturing the vibrancy of interiors decorated with posters and magazine cuttings. In books like Flamboya and Parasomnia, though, she seems intent on portraying her own semi-imaginary Africa, while the illuminating Sketches offers a glimpse of her creative process through the many preparatory Polaroids she has shot over the years. They are all intriguing books that map out a singular journey in contemporary photography. Now see this Speaking of Bourdin, on 6 February the ICA are hosting a panel discussion, Guy Bourdin: A Legacy. Speakers include his son, Samuel, and the fashion academic Judith Clark. There will also be a screening of some of Bourdin&apos;s little-seen films. The landscape photography of Thomas Joshua Cooper is on show at the Haunch of Venison in London. Cooper is a visual explorer of the world&apos;s wild places, which he locates on a map, researches in depth, then travels to and photographs using a 100-year-old Agfa camera and custom-made photographic plates.

The last time Affleck was involved in awards hullabaloo was with his debut film, Good Will Hunting, in 1997, and there must have been times (Gigli?) when the odds on him ever featuring at the likes of the SAGs and Oscars stretched to 200-1. &quot;Back then, the term &apos;awards season&apos; didn&apos;t even exist,&quot; he remarks. &quot;It&apos;s become a cottage industry now, and you can get tossed around in the churn of it all, but I wouldn&apos;t want to be the last guy to leave the party these days. I&apos;m happy I used to be that guy, and I&apos;ve got nice memories of that time, although I have to admit much of it was a blur. But, you know, I have no regrets about any of it. I had fun, I was young, what the heck.&quot; Affleck&apos;s fine thriller-caper-satire hybrid, Argo, has suddenly emerged as a frontrunner for the best picture Oscar, and before that he&apos;s coming to the Baftas for the first time and will be accompanied by his wife, Jennifer Garner. &quot;I hope Skyfall gets a reward there,&quot; he tells me. &quot;We shot a lot of Argo in Istanbul, and I was out there scouting locations while Bond was there. We shot in the same bazaar, but we were thinking about doing a scene on the rooftops so I went up and had a look and just thought: no way, it&apos;s too scary to walk along here. I couldn&apos;t believe it when I saw that opening of the Bond film and they were riding motorbikes up there. That film is just on a different level.&quot; Meanwhile, Affleck tells me he&apos;s working on adapting another novel by Dennis Lehane, whose Gone Baby Gone was the source of Affleck&apos;s first film as director. Lehane&apos;s Mystic River and Shutter Island have also made it on to the big screen, and he gave Affleck the first look at his latest book, Live By Night. Affleck is writing the screenplay himself. &quot;It&apos;s not easy, particularly as I&apos;m also working with Peter Morgan on another project and it just comes so easily to him to write. I get home and try to do Live By Night, and suddenly it&apos;s not so easy. But I&apos;l get there.&quot; Shane&apos;s shame Shane Meadows is completing work on his documentary about the Stone Roses&apos; 2012 comeback tour. Making the film, Made of Stone, Meadows followed his favourite band for a year, filming them and their fans at gigs in locations including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Japan and Heaton Park. What I didn&apos;t know was that Meadows was actually trying to recapture his own youth with this project. &quot;I&apos;m trying to make up for the nightmare of my lifetime,&quot; he says. At 17, Meadows had a ticket for the now legendary Roses gig at Spike Island. Bursting with excitement the night before, he took an acid trip, sold his ticket to someone and spent the rest of the weekend in a nightmare of his own making. He says all he can remember is &quot;being sat in a flat having a bad trip when I should have been at Spike Island, being part of one of the most momentous things ever&quot;. Meadows confesses that the bad trip and missing out on the gig was actually the trigger for him &quot;getting off his arse&quot; and going to college, where he began his forays into film-making. The Roses gig is also, of course, the subject of the forthcoming film Spike Island. Nice one.

But Bernal denied he&apos;s about to play two other Latino heroes himself, Panamanian boxing legend Roberto Dur\u00e1n and Zorro. &quot;If I&apos;m going to play Dur\u00e1n, they better tell me soon because I need to do a lot of work in the gym.

David&apos;s brother Miguel Angel, aged 36, has to be roused from the prone position. Their father Juli\u00e1n is here, as is their cousin Nuria, who keeps house, and admits that she is also finding it hard to stay awake. &quot;This place is getting to be like a hospital ward,&quot; says David as he squeezes his considerable bulk into a chair in their spacious but drab sitting room. The family&apos;s long, narrow Madrid apartment is a tunnel of doziness. Even at midday only a\u00a0dribble of daylight enters, adding to the sensation of semi-wakefulness. Our conversation is accompanied by a symphony of yawning, eye-rubbing, occasional drifts into semi-slumber and sudden jolts upright as David, Miguel Angel and Juli\u00e1n snap back \u2013 or simply panic that they may have missed something. They do not want to seem impolite. This gloomy apartment, on a street off Madrid&apos;s small red-light district, is a house of sleep. It is a place of yawning, snoozing and snoring, of eye-rolling, swooning bouts of momentary cataplexy and of wildly vivid, violent dreams. It is also a laboratory for the future where the mysteries of narcolepsy and cataplexy, the twin demons of hundreds of thousands of people, may be revealed. The L\u00f3pez clan is the first-known example of an extended family of sufferers in the world. Rosa Peraita-Adrados, the Madrid doctor whose dogged detective work tracked down the disconnected branches of a unique family that was fractured by Spain&apos;s bloody civil war, believes they could help to find a cure for one of the most puzzling of conditions. Their genes have already provided some of the strongest clues yet about what might be causing this strange and incapacitating sleep disorder. Doctors once thought of narcolepsy and cataplexy as separate illnesses. The former provokes irresistible bouts of sleep; the latter is a momentary muscular collapse provoked by sudden emotions or laughter. Now it is clear the two things usually go together. David admits to often nodding off halfway through a\u00a0task. He is so afraid of dropping dishes that he hugs them closely to his chest and walks very slowly to the dinner table. &quot;It is just the fear,&quot; his brother says. &quot;I sometimes want to point this out, or make a joke or something, but that might be worse.&quot; Laughter, he points out, is one of their worst enemies, as it provokes bouts of cataplexy. Narcolepsy and cataplexy were both first described in the 1880s \u2013 and even then the first case of the latter, discovered by German doctor Carl Westphal, was a family problem, shared by a mother and son. About one in 5,000 people are thought to suffer from a condition whose prevalence varies across the globe, with some 12,000 in Britain alone. Living with the illness can be tough. Sufferers struggle to stay either awake or asleep for a sustained period of time. Luckily for me, the L\u00f3pezes are enjoying our chat. &quot;The worst thing is boredom,&quot; explains David, who is 30 and, like his brother, is out of work. &quot;If I am doing something I really like, or a\u00a0project I am working at, then I can keep going for hours. The blood reaches your brain and keeps you going. But the moment you relax, the blood doesn&apos;t get there and off you go.&quot; &quot;Often you don&apos;t realise yourself what is happening,&quot; explains Miguel Angel. &quot;Someone says: &apos;Hey, you are falling asleep.&apos; And you say: &apos;No. No I am not.&apos; But you are.&quot; &quot;And then,&quot; adds their father, &quot;it is goodbye and you are out.&quot; Miguel Angel says that he has to tell any new friends about his condition immediately. &quot;But if you want a girlfriend then you have to find someone who is not only going to listen to you but can also understand what you are talking about.&quot; One symptom, the violent dream, is a relationship-wrecker; Miguel Angel&apos;s are terrifyingly vivid. &quot;I&apos;ve seen him hurl the bedside table across the room,&quot; says David. &quot;Or he is asleep shouting &apos;Fire! Fire!&apos;&quot; Once, Miguel Angel grabbed his girlfriend \u2013 now ex \u2013 by the throat in the middle of the night. &quot;I was upset with her about something and, rather than have it out with an argument, I took it to bed with me,&quot; he says. &quot;It must have been frightening.&quot; David, meanwhile, suffers persecution dreams. &quot;Above all what you feel is fear, panic and sometimes you even experience your own death. It is like starring in your own horror film.&quot; Juli\u00e1n&apos;s cousin Jes\u00fas \u2013 another of Peraita-Adrados&apos;s patients \u2013 battles with everything from monsters to gypsy gangs, thrashing his limbs around in action-packed fights. But not all the dreaming in the house is bad. Sometimes euphoria strikes instead. &quot;I have found my father chuckling loudly to himself in his sleep,&quot; says David. &quot;Sometimes I too have woken up laughing myself silly. It all depends on your mood.&quot;     \u201cI can walk along the street asleep. You hear what\u2019s going on, but your eyes are closed\u201d: twin brothers David and Miguel Angel L\u00f3pez. Photograph: Hannah Lucinda Smith for the Observer    Dreams are so lifelike that they play tricks on the memory and sensations of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2013 associated with extreme tiredness in non-narcoleptics \u2013 are common and intense. &quot;You are convinced you have lived it before,&quot; says David. &quot;In fact, you don&apos;t know what is real and what is not.&quot; Reality can be further scrambled by short episodes of microsleeps and automatic behaviour, when sufferers continue doing routine tasks even though they have actually fallen asleep for a few seconds. &quot;I can walk along the street asleep,&quot; explains Juli\u00e1n. &quot;You hear what is going on, but can&apos;t see because your eyes are closed. It lasts a few seconds and suddenly, bang! You wake up. Perhaps someone touches you, or your head starts falling and you wake up to recover your balance.&quot; David and Miguel ANGEL&apos;S mother knew she was marrying into a sleepy family. In the working-class Madrid barrio of Lavapi\u00e9s, their great-aunt Teodora was known as la dormida \u2013 the sleeping one. On the other side of Madrid, Juli\u00e1n&apos;s twin brother, Andr\u00e9s, recalls other members of the family who were famous for their doziness. &quot;Our own mother, Rosa, could walk down the street asleep,&quot; he says. &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t know how she avoided being run over.&quot; Their grandfather Domingo had similar symptoms. Like many narcoleptics, however, Rosa and Teodora worked around their illness, keeping down jobs as cleaners. Andr\u00e9s, now aged 63, has also held down jobs most of his life \u2013 though Peraita-Adrados thinks the night shifts he worked at one stage may have been the trigger for the symptoms of his illness to appear. Teodora&apos;s daughter Josefina, another sufferer who Peraita-Adrados tracked down in the modest Madrid barrio of Entrevias, says her mother and aunts developed their own mechanisms for controlling the disease. &quot;My mother would fall deeply asleep on the bus or the metro, but somehow always woke up just before her stop,&quot; she recalls. Teodora, Rosa and their sister Patro were known together as las bellas durmientes \u2013 the sleeping beauties \u2013 and, in their later years, the latter two could often be spotted snoozing together in the sunshine on a bench outside the barrio&apos;s church. &quot;We would all be eating together and suddenly both would be sitting there dozing. I remember Aunt Patro falling into her food,&quot; Andr\u00e9s tells me. &quot;Yes,&quot; says his cousin Jes\u00fas. &quot;Patro was the real number!&quot; &quot;Our mother was always on the lookout for the illness in us when we were children,&quot; says Miguel Angel. But symptoms often do not appear, or become striking, until the late teens or early adulthood. The brothers first noticed theirs in their mid-20s, though David recalls suffering an intense version of a common schoolchild&apos;s problem \u2013 staying awake in class. &quot;I swear I slept through half of them,&quot; he said.     \"It starts with my mouth being blocked, and then I lose strength. I can\u2019t walk. Either I stay still or I sit down\": Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez-Bartoli. Photograph: Hannah Lucinda Smith for the Observer    Peraita-Adrados first became aware of the family history when Andr\u00e9s was referred to the sleep disorder and epilepsy unit she runs at Madrid&apos;s Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n University Hospital. &quot;The first time I saw Andr\u00e9s,&quot; she says, &quot;he told me he had a twin brother, Juli\u00e1n, who had been diagnosed in another hospital. And Juli\u00e1n&apos;s children had also been diagnosed, but no one had put them all together. That was when I realised this might be interesting. There had been very little studying of families, so I got into contact with Professor Mehdi Tafti at the Centre for Integrative Genomics at the University of Lausanne, and said, &apos;This is important, why don&apos;t we study it?&apos;&quot; It took Peraita-Adrados years of trawling through records at various Madrid hospitals to trace the members of the clan and find their clinical histories. Different branches of the family went their own ways during the Spanish civil war in the 1930s, after they emerged from that conflict \u2013 like much of the militantly left-wing working class in Lavapi\u00e9s \u2013 on the losing side. Rosa and her husband were both jailed after General Franco&apos;s right-wing nationalists took Madrid in 1939 and rounded up many of those who had defended the city or joined the communist, socialist or anarchist groups that had helped run the Spanish capital over the previous three years. The twins and their four other children were distributed around the family and spent periods of their childhood apart. Their father was a candidate for the firing squad, but ended up with a long prison sentence; Rosa got out of jail earlier and later had children with another man. Death and prison fractured the clan, leaving a plethora of half-siblings and a split Spanish family. &quot;It is true there are a lot of us, but we hardly ever see them. Not aunties or cousins or anyone,&quot; explains David. &quot;Not that I&apos;ve ever felt the need. It has just always been like that.&quot; Now a family tree starting with great-grandfather Domingo covers 48 people over four generations, with 14 members of the third and fourth generations showing symptoms of narcolepsy-catoplexy. Fewer than 10% of narcolepsy-cataplexy sufferers have relatives with the illness, and only 1 or 2% share it with more than one other person in their family. Certainly no family as extended as this has been available to study before, offering a unique opportunity to reveal some of the genetic secrets of the disease. &quot;There is evidence that the origin of the illness is autoimmune in the 95% cases which do not have an obvious genetic cause,&quot; explains Peraita-Adrados. Sufferers seem to produce antibodies that attack the hypocretin neurons, stopping or slowing production. Doctors can now extract spinal fluid and test for hypocretin to make a diagnosis. &quot;If the levels are very low, or zero, you know that this individual will eventually have cataplexy,&quot; she explains. The few cases with a genetic origin that have been tested so far, like the L\u00f3pez family, also show no hypocretin. &quot;We found Andr\u00e9s and Jul\u00edan, the twins, had zero.&quot; The discovery of the hypocretin deficiency a decade ago was key to understanding the mechanism behind the symptoms. Produced in the brain&apos;s hypothalamus, hypocretin (also known as orexin) plays an important role in a person&apos;s alertness. It also affects feelings of fullness, which explains why narcoleptics often develop strange eating patterns and may become obese. Now the tests on the L\u00f3pez clan provide clues about what may be going wrong at a genetic level. The most important discovery is a mutation on a gene known as MOG, which is shared by all sufferers in the family, but none who do not have the illness. This gene codes for a protein called myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, which plays a key role in maintaining the central nervous system via an insulating material called myelin. The MOG gene has been linked to everything from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to multiple sclerosis. Researchers are understandably excited by the discovery of a mutation in a family of people suffering narcolepsy with cataplexy. The task now is to try to find a link between myelin in the central nervous system and hypocretin deficiency. &quot;What we are trying to do is complete the chain of the mechanism to work out how this mutation, which provokes a change in the myelin, connects to the part that we know about the symptoms and their mechanisms,&quot; says Peraita-Adrados. Cataplexy generally, but not always, appears several years after the symptoms of narcolepsy are clear. It comes on suddenly, usually caused by a sudden surge of emotion. Sufferers lose muscle tone from their head downwards \u2013 jaw or neck muscles slacken, eyes begin to roll and finally legs start feeling weak and may buckle. &quot;It starts with my mouth being blocked, and then I see that I am beginning to lose strength. I can&apos;t walk. Either I stay still or I sit down,&quot; explains Andr\u00e9s, who was a first division football linesman and still holds down a weekend job as a referee. &quot;It is as if I had gone out drinking and got totally plastered. Once it happened to me in the Puerta del Sol square and I remember people looking at me as if I\u00a0was a\u00a0stumbling drunk.&quot; Jokes, his cousin Jes\u00fas explains, are another problem. Laughter, excitement, intense sadness or strong emotions of almost any kind can set him off. &quot;Your neck feels weak and then your head just tips over.&quot; Even watching soccer matches can be tricky. &quot;I can&apos;t celebrate Real Madrid&apos;s goals,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone else is jumping up and down and shouting, but I try to limit myself to just clenching my fists in celebration. If I screamed, I&apos;d just fall over.&quot; Miguel Angel asks friends not to rag him. &quot;They don&apos;t always remember. The other day we were helping a friend shift boxes of fire extinguishers and everyone started mucking around and having a laugh. Suddenly the cataplexy came on, so I had to stop.&quot; Another common symptom is sleep paralysis, when they wake up, but cannot move or speak for up to two minutes. &quot;Obviously your breathing muscles don&apos;t seize up, but the rest of your musculature is completely paralysed,&quot; explains Peraita-Adrados. &quot;It produces huge anxiety.&quot;     \u201cI remember Aunt Patro falling asleep into her food\u201d: Josefina and her son David at home in Madrid.  Photograph: Hannah Lucinda Smith for the Observer    Treatment is currently restricted to lifestyle changes or trying to block sleep and cataplexy attacks. &quot;You don&apos;t cure the illness, you fight the symptoms,&quot; says Peraita-Adrados. American patients get amphetamines, while European doctors prescribe other stimulants. The new generation of Prozac-style anti-depressants help control cataplexy, though no one is sure why. Sodium oxybate, used in Europe for anaesthesia in the 1960s, is the only drug that improves nocturnal sleep and daytime symptoms. German investigators have begun to produce hypocretin \u2013 a\u00a0key peptide that narcoleptics lack \u2013 and this holds out one hope for a cure, but it is still early days. In another sleepy apartment on the other side of Madrid, Josefina struggles to get through stories about her children and grandchildren. The love she feels, and the waves of emotion her stories provoke, send her into brief bouts of cataplexy. Her 32-year-old son, also called David \u2013 who first noticed the symptoms while serving a drugs-related jail sentence \u2013 suffers from them, too. &quot;If I get angry or argue with someone then my legs start to go,&quot; he says. &quot;The last time was three days ago when I got angry with a guy on the bus and started telling him off.&quot; Standing by Josefina&apos;s front door, as we say goodbye, we talk about pet dogs. &quot;Mine died just three days ago, in David&apos;s arms,&quot; she says. The thought brings on a wave of sadness. Josefina&apos;s eyes roll over, her head tilts forward and she grabs for the doorframe, crumpling against it. Her cataplexy, explains Peraita-Adrados, is among the most severe \u2013 occasionally laying her out on the ground. Accidents happen. &quot;I&apos;ve burned myself a couple of times with cooking oil,&quot; Josefina admits. &quot;I&apos;ve seen her fall when she was doing the ironing, even when eating watermelon,&quot; says David. Many sufferers manage to lead almost normal lives, holding down jobs, pursuing hobbies and raising children. Medicines, siestas and knowing their own limitations all help. The former head of the Spanish patient&apos;s association, for example, regularly drives 300 miles from Alicante to Madrid on his motorbike. Learning to repress emotions is one of the worst side-effects of the illness, says Peraita-Adrados. &quot;Adults can have terrible lives. I&apos;ve seen failed marriages and lots of people with problems at work. I had one patient who was a long-haul truck driver, doing journeys from Madrid to Amsterdam and, of course, he had an accident. He suffered with head injuries, but fortunately his life was saved.&quot; One member of the L\u00f3pez clan had been a taxi driver. &quot;But the worst thing is the children,&quot; she says. &quot;We are now seeing symptoms appear at a fairly early stage. These kids fall asleep in class and get called dozy-heads. They are fat, so they can&apos;t play. And then cataplexy starts to appear. They have to learn to control their emotions. They realise that when they are watching cartoons, for example, they can fall into cataplexy \u2013 and they just don&apos;t understand what is happening. I have a lovely little patient \u2013 the youngest I have ever seen \u2013 a girl called Natalia who is just six years old. She is an adorable, beautiful child. I asked her to draw me her dreams, so she did a lovely little drawing of her going over a bridge, but there was a monster there. I asked: &apos;And what is that?&apos; And she said: &apos;Well, if I laugh I could fall and then the monster could come and attack me.&apos; Her mother says she laughs less and less.&quot; The genetic study may come too late to help the generation of Juli\u00e1n, Andr\u00e9s and Josefina \u2013 but sufferers like Natalia will benefit if their extended family helps fill in the gaps in the chain of cause and effect. &quot;If by studying us they can get close to finding a cure, then that would be fantastic,&quot; says Miguel Angel. &quot;It would be great,&quot; agrees David.

Apple executives meet with Turkish president to discuss $4.5bn iPad education initiative &gt;&gt; Mac Rumors  Apple executives including vice president for education John Couch met with Turkish president Abdullah G\u00fcl today to discuss several issues. The office of the Turkish president has also posted a photo and a brief video from the meeting.   Among the primary topics addressed during the meeting was Turkey&apos;s tablet initiative, a $4.5bn program to provide as many as 15 million tablets to Turkish schoolchildren. Apple has reportedly been pushing for the contract, but negotiations are said to still be underway.  Also discussed was the layout of the older Turkish &quot;F-keyboard&quot; on iOS devices, which has several keys located in the wrong positions.   Expect Samsung to have been next in the room.  PressureNet app feeds scientists atmospheric data from thousands of smartphones &gt;&gt; MIT Technology Review  An Android app that measures atmospheric pressure is now feeding that distributed data to scientists working on better ways to predict the weather.  The app, called PressureNet, highlights the potential of distributed sensing using mobile devices and shows how the sophisticated sensors found in modern smartphones could be harnessed for research. It was launched in late 2011 By Jacob Sheehy, a software developer for Flighthub.com, and Phil Jones, an independent Web designer, who became friends while studying at Concordia University in Montreal.  Atmospheric pressure sensors are unique to Android, though not all Android phones have them. Google added the ability to measure pressure to its operating system because the data can help improve location finding. While PressureNet isn&apos;t the only Android app that displays pressure information for users, its creators think it&apos;s the only one that collects the data and shares it.   Brilliant, brilliant idea. Blackberry: the charge of the Light Brigade &gt;&gt; TechPinions John Kirk rounds off a very fine piece on BB10:   I have tremendous respect for what they&apos;ve done. The original Blackberry phones were category busters and a wonder to behold. But the truth is, it does not matter if the Blackberry 10 hardware and software are narrowly better than the iPhone or Android phones. They have to be so superior that customers will be willing to switch. Because remaining the number four, or even the number three, smartphone OS is not going to cut it with developers. And people don&apos;t switch platforms unless the alternative is not just superior but FAR superior to their current platform. Just ask the Mac, the Zune, and Windows Phone 7.  Device prices, self-selection and a Catch 22 &gt;&gt; Benedict Evans  The challenge with all of these tablets, though, lies in the choice presented to consumers. In effect, they are asked: &quot;would you rather buy this Apple tablet with lots of apps, or save $100 or so and get this black plastic thing with far fewer apps?&quot;  That&apos;s a perfectly legitimate question to ask (and Christmas was one big A-B test as to what tablets people actually want). However, what does it tell you if someone says &apos;I want to save $100 and get the cheap-looking one with no apps&apos;? Are they a good target for any publisher or developer? This is at the root of the staggeringly low engagement on Android tablets that all publisher report - under 5% of what they see on the iPad.  In other words, you can sell to a high-end user and hope that they&apos;ll forgive the lack of apps. That&apos;s hard, and you won&apos;t sell many. Or, you can make a cheap device (setting aside the technical challenges BlackBerry and Nokia faced in actually doing that), which is rather easier to sell with no apps - but then the user base you do get is even less likely to buy apps.

Italy&apos;s friendly firepower  You can take your joga bonito, your tiki-taka, your total football and any other contrivance you care to mention: what it is all supposed to boil down to is winning, pure and simple. No national team down the decades have better represented that attitude \u2013 the single-minded pursuit of victory \u2013 than Italy. They are the ultra-competitors, which is perhaps why, deep down, the notion of friendly matches seems to offend them, or at least turn them off. Few nations&apos; friendly results contrast with their competitive results as sharply as Italy&apos;s. Accordingly, the Euro 2012 finalists go into Wednesday&apos;s match in Amsterdam on the back of five straight defeats in friendlies (to Uruguay, USA, Russia, England and France). It will be interesting to see how hard they fight to avoid a sixth, which would be a record losing streak. It will also be interesting to see how the intriguing and potentially wonderful new Milan partnership of Mario Balotelli and Stephan El Shaarawy fare on the international stage. Balotelli reckons that the duo, who played together in the defeat to France before they became club-mates, could be deadly: &quot;Playing with me could work because I&apos;m quite a generous player,&apos;&apos; he said. &quot;He could score a lot and so could I.&quot; 2. Holland&apos;s new midfield  The Dutch are in the doldrums and Louis van Gaal will use this match to try to sketch out a way forward. With several erstwhile stalwarts either injured, out of form or out of favour, the Oranje will have a decidedly green look about them on Wednesday. The make-up of the midfield will be especially interesting, with Swansea&apos;s Jonathan de Guzman in line to start, probably alongside the 22-year-old Kevin Strootman of PSV and AZ Alkmaar&apos;s 19-year-old schemer, Adam Maher. If Feyenoord&apos;s 21-year-old Jordy Clasie is chosen ahead of De Guzman, the Holland midfield will consist entirely of young home-based players. There could be another youngster further forward, notably on the left, where Benfica&apos;s exciting 20-year-old Ola John, brother of Collins, may well start. 3. France&apos;s persistent players  Moussa Sissoko had been ignored by France managers for over two years until he was called up last October for the friendly against Japan and the World Cup qualifier in Spain. He was superb against the Spanish, embarking on the sort of run that Newcastle fans are already familiar with, before setting up France&apos;s late equaliser. A midfield featuring Sissoko, Yohan Cabaye and Blaise Matuidi offers power and precision and their contest with their Germany counterparts could be fascinating. With Les Bleus in decent form, Didier Deschamps does not plan to make many changes but one player whose performances in Ligue 1 have almost demanded that he be given a debut is Romain Alessandrini, the 23-year-old left-sided attacker from Rennes who may just be an eventual replacement for Franck Rib\u00e9ry. Like Rib\u00e9ry (and Mathieu Valbuena), Alessandrini gives hopes to players who were rejected as youngsters, having been ditched by Marseille when he was 15. He briefly gave up on becoming a professional footballer but took a contract with Gueugnon in the third tier. From there he moved to Clermont Foot in Ligue 2 until being brought to the top flight by Rennes last summer. In only 19 matches in Ligue 1 he has scored nine goals, made five assists and dazzled sufficiently to convince Deschamps that he may belong among the elite. 4. Clash of champions  It&apos;s the European and world champions against the champions of South America, for goodness sake! OK, so there have been the predictable slew of withdrawals and Uruguay have been stuttering so much of late that their chances of reaching the next World Cup are in real jeopardy but Luis Su\u00e1rez, Diego Forl\u00e1n and Edinson Cavani may start together again. It is always worth watching that trio, and with Su\u00e1rez only four goals shy of Forl\u00e1n&apos;s all-time Uruguay record of 33, watching them could be more amusing than ever, what with checking to see if there is any slight reluctance on Forl\u00e1n&apos;s behalf when it comes to passing to his team-mate. Chelsea&apos;s C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta could be among the Spain defenders trying to complicate Su\u00e1rez&apos;s task. 5. Socceroos places up for grabs  Australia are unbeaten in their last six matches but half of them were against countries with fewer than 11 inhabitants and their last defeat, against Jordan in September, was fully deserved. It also severely dented their chances of reaching the World Cup. To undo the damage caused by the loss in Amman, the Socceroos need to beat Oman next month and this match with Romania in M\u00e1laga is seen as a vital part of the preparation for that, with several spots in the starting lineup seemingly still up for grabs. Their captain Lucas Neill is suspended for the Oman game so a solid performance against an impressive Romania attack could seal the deal for one of Rhys Williams (the 19-year-old Middlesbrough player who is seen as a potential star for Australia), Ryan McGowan or Robert Cornthwaite, the Chunnam Dragons defender who was excellent in November&apos;s friendly win in South Korea. Nikita Rukavytsya and Mathew Leckie also starred in that match and may get a chance to see if they can stand out amid more established attacking options such as Brett Holman, Mark Bresciano, Alex Brosque and Robbie Kruse. 6.

Tostadas are deep-fried corn tortillas with a heap of something good on top. This bustling and colourful stall offers more than a dozen huge plates of mouthwatering toppings. Fresh shrimp prepared with tomato and chilli, chicken in brick-red salsa, crab salad, pork in chocolate-y mole, and the list goes on.

It&apos;s packed with young fans and old-timers alike, downing deep-fried fish fillets, shrimp cocktails, tostadas and ceviches. Served in a parfait glass or on a crisp fried corn tortilla, ceviches are salads of\u00a0fish, crab, squid or octopus, marinated in lime juice and white herbal vinegar, then finished off with a little olive oil and a few slices of avocado, chopped tomato, chilli, onion and coriander. The simple dressing compliments the seafood without overwhelming it \u2013 a perfect balance of salty, sour, and fishy umami. \u2022 Calle Ayuntamiento, near L\u00f3pez, a few blocks south of the Alameda, Centro, open Mon-Sat, approximately 11am-6pm Tacos al pastor: El Huequito     Tacos al pastor street food, Mexico City Photograph: Nicholas Gilman    The most chilango (slang for &apos;from Mexico City&apos;) food of all, tacos al pastor are the perhaps the only dish truly associated with capital itself.\u00a0El Huequito\u00a0(which means the little hole-in-the-wall) has been in business since 1959 in the old centre. These tacos, the legacy of the city&apos;s many Lebanese immigrants, a variation of shawarma, the grilled marinated meat dish popular throughout the Middle East. Here pork, thinly sliced, is swathed in a chilli sauce, roasted on a revolving spit, sliced off, enhanced with chopped onion and coriander, and rolled up in a small tortilla. The meat is juicy and succulent, the smoky grilled aroma lingering until you take the next bite. These 12-peso morsels are pure coraz\u00f3n Mexicano (heart of Mexico). \u2022 Ayuntamiento 21, a few blocks south of the Alameda, Centro, open daily, 8am-10pm Tacos de guisados: Taquer\u00eda El Guero (Hola) Guisados are saucy stews with a thousand variations.

This small standing-room-only taquer\u00eda, identified on its awning with the single word &quot;HOLA&quot;, is renowned locally, a favourite of Condesa hipsters. Unusually for Mexico, several vegetarian choices are offered. Try the quelites (cooked leafy greens), acelgas (Swiss chard) or colifl\u00f3r (fried cauliflower.)

It&apos;s a fast food that blends European and Mexican cultures. The story goes that it was invented by one Sr Armando, an Italian immigrant, as his riff on the Italian panino \u2013 he adapted it to available ingredients and the locals&apos; penchant for avocado and chilli. Tortas Been is located inside an odd pasaje, or indoor passage, which is also home to several stores selling Mexican folkloric costumes. The tortas de pierna (roast pork leg), pollo (chicken) or pavo ahumado (smoked turkey) are worth the 10-minute walk from the Z\u00f3calo.

They&apos;re unceremoniously served heaped on a plate, with an array of red and green salsas, coriander, onions and lime; and fresh warm corn tortillas, of course. The roasted aroma of these porky treats emanates from La Reina de la Roma, a simple fonda with a few tables spilling on to the street, in the old Colonia Roma neighborhood, near its interesting central market.

Do\u00f1a Yoli, a humble operation, has been doling out luscious red pozole for decades. The rich broth contains pork, maize, all the trimmings described above, and good tostadas are served on the side.

Salsas are homemade, beautiful and powerful. Mexican-style burgers (topped with salsa, bacon, cheese) are sensational.

He added the Saudi Arabia because otherwise Americans might not know where he was. He had taken two planes to get there. In Nairobi, Kenya, he had met a woman he would probably have gone to bed with if he had stayed. But he didn&apos;t, so he didn&apos;t. He tried to sleep but he couldn&apos;t. Even reading his own sensitively pared-down sentences didn&apos;t help. Put simply, he was a complete failure. He was 54 years old, divorced and broke. He couldn&apos;t even afford the tuition fees for his daughter, Kit, who was at college in Boston, USA. He started writing Kit a letter. &quot;Dear Kit, here is another letter I\u00a0am unlikely to send.&quot; This was his last chance. An opportunity to make a six-figure commission selling an IT system to the King Abdullah Economic City in the desert. Luckily, he did not stop to wonder why an American IT giant would have employed a complete idiot to sell its most expensive hardware. So the reader did not have to, either. It was nine o&apos;clock when Alan eventually woke up. &quot;Oh dear,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;I&apos;ve missed the bus out to KAEC and I am going to be late for the king. That&apos;s not very good, is it?&quot; He\u00a0phoned down to reception for\u00a0a\u00a0cab. &quot;Hello,&quot; said Yousef. &quot;I&apos;m your driver. Though I&apos;m not really a driver. Tell me a joke.&quot; &quot;The company I work for is called Reliant.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s not really a joke, Alan. That&apos;s yet more irony about America&apos;s growing global economic dependency.&quot; Alan touched the lump on the back of his neck. He was sure it was cancer. Fingers crossed, it was. The heat was oppressive when he arrived at his tent in the desert. &quot;I&apos;m sorry I&apos;m late,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; Karim would have replied if he had bothered to turn up. &quot;The King isn&apos;t coming today. Or any day soon for that matter.&quot; Alan touched his lump again and thought he was beginning to get the hang of this metaphor. &quot;Hello,&quot; said a woman called Hanne from Amsterdam, Holland. &quot;Seeing as you are going to spend the next 100 pages making pointless trips into the desert, why don&apos;t you have a drink and have sex with me?&quot; He fumbled a bit but his cock was as limp as the subtext. &quot;Never mind,&quot; Hanne said brusquely. &quot;Let me take you to the doctor to have your lump looked at.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s definitely a benign cyst,&quot; said the sultry Dr Hakem, much to everyone&apos;s dispappointment. &quot;But I can take it out for you.&quot; Alan found himself with a lot of spare time on his hands, even after writing dozens more letters to Kit that he would never send. So when Yousef offered to take him out into the desert to go wolf-shooting, he eagerly accepted after making a bad joke about being in the CIA. &quot;That&apos;s not funny, either,&quot; said Yousef. Alan knew he was going to kill the wolf. But he fired at a shepherd boy by mistake. &quot;Whoops,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s OK,&quot; Yousef said. &quot;Luckily you missed. You&apos;d better go back to Jeddah.&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve taken out your cyst,&quot; Dr Hakem purred. &quot;Now I want to sleep with you.&quot; &quot;All right,&quot; Alan said, completely unaware of how improbable it was that every attractive younger woman in the book should find him irresistible. It was still very hot when he went back out to KAEC a fortnight later. &quot;I&apos;m glad you&apos;ve arrived,&quot; said Karim, who had by now bothered to turn up, &quot;because the King is finally here.&quot; &quot;Do you think he will like my presentation?&quot; &quot;Yes, but I wouldn&apos;t count on him sleeping with you as well. Or on him buying your system, as he now wants to do business with China.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s symbolism for you, I suppose,&quot; Alan shrugged. He was still 54, broke and a loser. &quot;Do you think it would be OK to stay on out here a\u00a0while?&quot; &quot;To be honest, we&apos;ve all had enough of you.&quot; Digested read, digested: Alan of Arabia.", "sentences": ["&quot;Hello,&quot; said a woman called Hanne from Amsterdam, Holland."], "title": "A Hologram for the King by Dave Eggers \u2013 digested read", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/10/hologram-for-the-king-digested-read", "tags": ["Dave Eggers", "Books", "Fiction", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-02-10T20:00:01Z", "article": "The town of Scunthorpe has been voted the least romantic place in Britain by a poll for a hotels website.\u00a0It&apos;s a predictable choice, and\u00a0I\u00a0suspect\u00a0it&apos;s more to do with having that four-letter word stuffed into its name\u00a0than any lack of rose gardens, picnic sites policed by swans holding wings or whatever it is\u00a0that counts towards making a town seem loved-up.

I thought I was\u00a0probably gay and I knew I was definitely bookish, and you could only buy books in the charity shops or in WH Smith. I hated the town centre. I hated Scunthorpe&apos;s nightclubs more, especially the visionary Club 2000, which sounded less like the future for the six years it stayed open after the millennium. It had nothing for me, I was sure of it. As soon as I finished college I took a National Express down south and I never lived there again. But in the grand rhetoric of love gone sour, it wasn&apos;t Scunthorpe, it was me. Every kid with bloated dreams from a small town needs to rage at where they&apos;re from, because that becomes the fuel we need to escape. There was a brilliant BBC2 comedy a couple of years ago called Home Time, which was unjustly ignored by viewers and\u00a0failed\u00a0to be recommissioned as a result. It&apos;s about a woman, Gaynor, who goes back home to Coventry after a decade in London. Coventry is on this anti-romance list, too, at number six. There are many parallels; Coventry is as functional, solid and normal as Scunthorpe. It dresses modestly, and doesn&apos;t stand out from the\u00a0crowd.\u00a0It just exists, gets on with it. Home Time is embarrassing, funny and true \u2013 there are jokes about the petrol station branching\u00a0out into sushi, and optimistic new-builds \u2013 but ultimately the drama is driven by romance. And that&apos;s not because Gaynor finds love, though\u00a0there&apos;s a vague suggestion of it, but\u00a0because she finds a sort of peace with Coventry that isn&apos;t nostalgia, more a recognition that where we&apos;re from makes us who we are, and\u00a0there&apos;s no running away from that. That, to me, is romantic. Romance is weird and personal and unique to all of us, after all. That&apos;s why grownups get Twilight tattoos and slobber over Team Edward\u00a0or Team Jacob. It&apos;s why couples propose on a submarine bobbing around the wreck of the Titanic, that loved-up watery deathbed of 1,500 people. It&apos;s Shane Warne and Liz Hurley, and Courtney Stodden and Doug Hutchison. Romance\u00a0thrives on a well-flexed imagination. All\u00a0of the places on the unromantic list \u2013 Bradford,\u00a0Newport, Blackpool \u2013 are predominantly working-class. The ones that wooed voters \u2013 the Cotswolds, Oxford, Brighton \u2013 are not. This can&apos;t be a coincidence. Our collective\u00a0idea of picture-perfect love is a snobbish cliche. It&apos;s a turn-off. The Lake District topped the poll. Of course it did. The Lake District is Wordsworth and National\u00a0Trust blankets and teacakes. It&apos;s the vacant high-school jock in a teen movie about weirdos. It&apos;s lovely looking. It would buy you a perfectly nice meal in a perfectly nice restaurant,\u00a0would walk you home and wouldn&apos;t\u00a0even try to touch you up, because it&apos;s so\u00a0bloody nice and polite. North Lincolnshire is Philip Larkin and This Is England and sausage rolls and trainers. It&apos;s not wearing a coat on a night out in December. Scunthorpe would pick you up in its Ford Fiesta, stop off at the chippy, drive you to the river, then tip back your seat \u2013 and it would definitely try its luck. It&apos;s taken me a long time to realise it, but it turns out I really fancy Scunthorpe after all.", "sentences": ["Once I ended up in a village made of factories, two hours&apos; drive from Amsterdam, looking for a trance rave I was supposed to be reviewing, with no phone, no money and no Dutch."], "title": "Why Scunthorpe is not the least romantic place in Britain | Rebecca Nicholson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/10/scunthorpe-rough-and-ready-charm", "tags": ["England holidays", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-02-11T15:19:12Z", "article": "I had no idea what to think when I got an email from LinkedIn, the Facebook for employed and want-to-be-employed people, congratulating me. Apparently, my profile was among the top 5 percent of all profiles viewed on the site in 2012. I grew up in the upstate New York blue-collar town of Amsterdam, where my father rested whiskey bottles upside down on our tavern bar to drain out every last drop. I had long ago decided I was going to do everything I could with my yeoman-like work ethic to become as much of a maker as I am a taker. But even for me, news of this feat was still surreal. Surreal because I&apos;m not the type to seek attention or get it. I&apos;m not a glory hound \u2013 never was, never will be. It&apos;s just not in my DNA.  My professional career mirrored that image, as I always labored behind the scenes and behind the people with the bylines and the star power. I rose from copyeditor to managing editor at various newspapers and dotcoms, helping to deliver the news, hit deadlines and maintain the editorial integrity of each publication. So, when I received this LinkedIn email, I couldn&apos;t help but feel a bit odd and increasingly proud that I was getting some recognition from somewhere, even if it was LinkedIn. Then the creepiness set in, who was viewing me? As editor-in-chief of Zillow, a mobile and online real estate marketplace whose foundation was built on Zestimate home values, I&apos;ve long understood that the web is where it&apos;s all happening for networking and a kind of limitless democratization of all kinds of mediums and industries.  I like LinkedIn and used it from the start. I have even occasionally been wooed for jobs along the way via LinkedIn. There was a headhunter a year ago who, representing the Thomas Cook travel agency in London, asked if I&apos;d like to move across the pond. Just a few months ago, a director-level position job for Sears was floated by me from the department store chain&apos;s headquarters in Chicago. And I have used LinkedIn to try to find writers and freelancers. It&apos;s a great service. But still, there I was &quot;one of the select 5% whose profiles have been among the most viewed&quot;. I&apos;m thinking I&apos;m pretty special. That is, until I did the math and realized that I am the top 5% of LinkedIn&apos;s entire registered user base. More specifically, 200m people, which means I was one of 10m people to receive this mail. To put it in perspective, that&apos;s the size of the population of Greece, or Portugal or Rwanda.  Suddenly, I didn&apos;t feel very special anymore. I am just a small drop in the bucket of LinkedIn&apos;s ingenious marketing ploy to tug at my vanity and make me feel special. Now what? Find out who viewed my profile on LinkedIn? For $7.95 a year, I can do that by &quot;unlocking the full list of people who have viewed me&quot;. Pretty cheap to find out who&apos;s trailing me for an entire year.  But let&apos;s do the math again. If just 20% of the 10m people who got this message were curious enough to pay $7.95 to see who&apos;s following them, that&apos;s 2m people generating approximately $15m for LinkedIn&apos;s bottom line. Fifteen million dollars \u2013 all as a result of an email telling us we are special. Brilliant, LinkedIn. But you&apos;re not getting my $7.95 today. Probably not tomorrow, either. I might be curious who is viewing my profile, but I&apos;ve gotten this far without knowing. And if someone wants me, they seem to know where to find me.", "sentences": ["I grew up in the upstate New York blue-collar town of Amsterdam, where my father rested whiskey bottles upside down on our tavern bar to drain out every last drop."], "title": "Hey, look at me!

The 17 drawings \u2013 15 of which belong to the Soane, with the two on loan from institutions in Paris and Amsterdam \u2013 depict the three magnificent ancient Greek temples in Paestum, south of Naples. With typical Piranesian drama, they depict dark, gloomy and heavily shadowed ruins. The heavily pitted doric colonnades march gloomily into the distance; the crumbling masonry sprouts foliage. The images were the working drawings for an elaborate set of engravings completed and published after the artist&apos;s death as Diff\u00e9rentes Vues de Pesto (Various Views of Paestum). According to Soane Museum curator Jerzy Kierkuc-Bielinski, Piranesi was somewhat secretive about his studio practice, and very few working drawings such as these survive. Best known for his engravings of views of the monuments of ancient Rome, and his fantastical series Carceri d&apos;Invenzione (&quot;imaginary prisons&quot;), he liked his admirers to believe that his work was the product of immediate and profound moments of inspiration. A separate pair of drawings in the museum, which he probably presented to the Scottish architect Robert Adam, for example, shows imaginary architectural scenes without the hint of a mistake or correction, apparently the product of a moment of unperfectable genius. But these late drawings of Paestum, said Kierkuc-Bielinski, tell a different story. &quot;They are incredibly carefully planned,&quot; he said. &quot;You can see that they start with drawing, that&apos;s then fixed with chalk, then there&apos;s ink washes and pen-and-ink.&quot; Different drawings show different stages in the creative process being worked through: one emphasises the deep shadows cast by the temple columns, for example; another just lightly suggests the shadows through a hint of red chalk, while the lines of the architecture are focused on. &quot;You can see different things being investigated,&quot; said Kierkuc-Bielinski. &quot;He is working in the tradition of drawing being used as an extension of thought.&quot; The temples, buit by Greek colonists from the sixth century BC, lay virtually undiscovered in the malarial swamps of coastal Campania until the 1740s, when the architect Mario Gioffredo made the first measured drawings of the structures. The drawings made by Piranesi on the spot in this still remote and disease-ridden spot would have been rough working sketches \u2013 not the elaborate drawings seen at the Soane, said Kierkuc-Bielinski. These drawings would have been worked up later in the studio, with the help of assistants. Indeed, the bucolic scenes of rural folk and their flocks seen in the foreground of many of the drawings are complete fantasy, he added, some of them comically so (a group of fishermen, for example, appear to be hauling up their nets near the steps of a temple in one of the drawings, without a wave in sight). And in some of the drawings, the perspective is clearly altered to emphasise the sinister, louring effects of the temple colonnades. &quot;These are dramatic drawings with distorted perspective: he creates highly ambiguous spaces,&quot; said Kierkuc-Bielinski. &quot;There is incredible theatricality and inventiveness; he breaks rules and creates dense, rich, terrifying, disconcerting scenes.&quot; Piranesi&apos;s Paestum drawings are at Sir John Soane&apos;s Museum, London WC2, until 18 May", "sentences": ["The 17 drawings \u2013 15 of which belong to the Soane, with the two on loan from institutions in Paris and Amsterdam \u2013 depict the three magnificent ancient Greek temples in Paestum, south of Naples."], "title": "Piranesi works drawn together in London for first time since 18th century", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/14/piranesi-works-london-first-time", "tags": ["Sir John Soane's Museum", "Art", "Art and design", "Museums", "Culture", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-02-14T20:40:49Z", "article": "It is fair to assume that Valentine&apos;s Day has lost some of its sparkle for the few hundred Chelsea supporters who travelled to Prague for this tie. It had promised little, apart from the novelty of seeing the club in Europa League action for the first time, and the reality in the sub-zero temperatures was even bleaker. Thank heavens for Oscar, the 82nd- minute substitute, who scored a lovely goal within seconds of his introduction, and for the interim manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez, who will surely be hailed for what was a game-defining change. Or maybe not. The devoted souls in the away enclosure had vented their irritation at Ben\u00edtez during the second-half as they endured a desperately tedious encounter that looked set to be remembered for the further toils of Fernando Torres. But Oscar brought belated cheer and the prospect of serene passage in next Thursday&apos;s return in London, which stands to fulfil the stag do double-header with a last 16 meeting against Ajax of Amsterdam. The Brazilian ran on from the touchline and almost immediately, he had swapped passes with Eden Hazard and showed his trademark balance and technique to swerve past his marker and open up the chance. His finish was left-footed, sweet and out of keeping with almost everything that had gone before it. There had been plenty of time to ask searching questions. What were the European champions doing here, in front of 18,952 fans, in the week when the Champions League last 16 had enthralled us? What was anybody doing here? Did anybody care? For long spells, it seemed as though few people did. But Oscar&apos;s intervention created a rosy glow. It was the first time this calendar year that Chelsea had won back-to-back fixtures, after Saturday&apos;s home win over Wigan Athletic. Perhaps, there is something to build on. Chelsea had flickered at the outset, with Hazard and Marko Marin getting into dangerous areas and the near sell-out crowd, who had pitched up for Sparta&apos;s biggest game in years and their first since 6 December and the Czech league&apos;s winter hibernation, did not exactly create a pulsating atmosphere. But Chelsea came to show alarming defensive vulnerability and Sparta were the better team in the first-half. But for David Lafata&apos;s loose finishing, the story could have been different. The winter break signing from Jablonec blew the chance to mark his debut with a goal on 16 minutes, when he fastened unattended on to Tomas Zapotocny&apos;s cross. He lifted his shot over the crossbar. Chelsea lived on the finest of margins and there were nervy moments in their backline, with Petr Cech also catching the bug. Ladislav Krejci went down inside the area after going shoulder-to-shoulder with C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta; Lafata was pulled back for offside and Krejci was adjudged to have run the ball out of touch before his cutback for Vaclav Kadlec. Lafata also dragged another excellent shooting chance wide. Torres was on the end of Chelsea&apos;s brightest moments in the first-half, which was annoying, given that he was in one of those moods when he looked disinterested and nothing would go right for him. Twice, Hazard crossed dangerously but Torres could not read his intentions and when Juan Mata opted to pass to him, rather than shoot when well-placed on the break, Torres&apos; weak effort never threatened. The striker stubbed another shot before half-time. Ben\u00edtez&apos;s defence of Torres was the personification of stoicism. &quot;We have to create more opportunities and then he will score more goals,&quot; he said. &quot;His work rate was very good and thanks to him, the offensive line could create. His job was crucial to run and keep the defenders deep to make that space for the other players. Everybody expects a striker to score goals but he is also doing a great job for the team.&quot; It was easy to feel the bitter cold and not only because of the lack of spirit-warming entertainment. Still, Ben\u00edtez braved the elements in nothing more than a suit and shirt; he has long since eschewed the flak jacket. The first murmurs of dissent from the Chelsea fans came in the 53rd minute, when they told Ben\u00edtez, impolitely, to leave, as he was not wanted. It has been the soundtrack to his interim tenure. Right on cue, Marin crossed and Torres failed to connect with his volley. It was deeply frustrating. There was the usual vociferous support of Frank Lampard and the stand-in captain headed a half-chance at the goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik from Mata&apos;s cross. It was a rare moment of second-half enterprise and when Torres shot so far wide in the 71st minute that the ball went out for a throw-in, the evening felt complete. But there was a sting, when Oscar made his dramatic entrance. Chelsea were more solid at the back in the second-half and Ben\u00edtez felt that they showed better &quot;concentration and intensity.&quot; Torres even finished by drawing a smart save out of Vaclik. The full-time whistle, though, came as a relief.", "sentences": ["But Oscar brought belated cheer and the prospect of serene passage in next Thursday&apos;s return in London, which stands to fulfil the stag do double-header with a last 16 meeting against Ajax of Amsterdam."], "title": "Sparta Prague 0-1 Chelsea", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/14/sparta-prague-chelsea-europa-league", "tags": ["Europa League", "Chelsea", "Sparta Prague", "Football", "Sport", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-02-16T07:04:00Z", "article": "It&apos;s typical of Deborah Moggach that the novel she\u00a0calls a &quot;love letter&quot; to Mel Calman, her partner of\u00a0many years who died in 1994, is called The Ex-Wives. Its hero Buffy, aka retired actor Russell Buffery, is a\u00a0warm-hearted rogue with a labyrinthine private life featuring five\u2011children and a stepdaughter by four different women. &quot;He&apos;d been around the block a few times,&quot; Moggach says of Calman. &quot;He was a great chatter, very close to his mother and very at ease with women. We could talk and talk, and our 10-year relationship was one long conversation that was stopped by his death. We could have gone on talking forever.&quot; Now she has written a second novel about Buffy, though this time around she says the character bears less resemblance to Calman. Heartbreak Hotel, her 20th book and published on Valentine&apos;s Day, is a romantic comedy set in the Welsh B&amp;B that Buffy has inherited from a friend and decides to turn into a business. &quot;Courses for divorces&quot;, ranging from cookery to car maintenance, are aimed at recently separated singles in need of life skills. The novel has elements of farce and a soundtrack of the scraping of twin beds being pushed together overhead. &quot;It was a hoot, I laughed at my jokes and I loved writing it,&quot; Moggach says. But it is also her third novel, following The Ex-Wives and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, about the change of life that comes with retirement, about ageing and the ramifications of the modern extended family. Especially, it is about the challenge of finding love in later life, when everyone is so weighed down by decades of memories and regrets. In writing Heartbreak Hotel she drew on her relationship with Calman, whom she never married or lived with mainly because he was not a good fit with her two young children, who were understandably upset that she had left their dad. She says: &quot;I was jealous of his past and I hate that because I think it&apos;s very unstylish and completely unprofitable, but what I wanted to explore in the book, and what I feel in life, is that really one is jealous of the person they were before, whom one will never know. It&apos;s not so much the other people in their lives one minds about but that younger version of them, the person who rode a motorbike! One mourns the lost world of one&apos;s own past and their past.&quot; Born in 1948, Moggach was one of four daughters of a fighter pilot and a Wren who met during the war. Both were writers, and discipline was part of her inheritance. &quot;They both worked every morning, on typewriters on the verandah of the cottage we lived in outside Watford. They were both very unneurotic and unpretentious about it. They tucked themselves away and wrote some really good books, though my father also wrote a few of the old potboilers because he had to keep us all going.&quot; Moggach went to Camden School for Girls, then Bristol university, where a phase of adolescent rebellion lasted until her early 20s and meant she didn&apos;t make the most of student life. Instead she moved in with a man who worked as a bus conductor and drank too much. It was only when she married and went to live in Pakistan that Moggach started writing, bringing out two novels based on her own experiences in the late 1970s. Back in London she kept an allotment, and wrote when her two children were asleep. But she became disenchanted with novel-writing when her fifth book, Porky, a spare, stark story of father-daughter incest on a pig farm near Heathrow, failed to win the attention she felt it deserved. &quot;Her whole life came to me literally in an hour, it was a very extraordinary experience,&quot; she says. &quot;My editor sort of forgot about it, she admitted that afterwards. She didn&apos;t put it forward for the Booker, she didn&apos;t promote it. I was very upset about that, so I decided to give up on books for a bit and start writing for television. I thought I&apos;d have a bit more fun and actors would call me &apos;darling&apos; and things.&quot; And so began Moggach&apos;s parallel career as a script writer, which still produces a regular stream of commissions and had its high point in 2005 when she won a Bafta nomination for her adaptation of Jane Austen&apos;s Pride and Prejudice, directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley. It was in a cinema that Moggach lost the man for whom she left her husband. Newspaper cartoonist Calman lived in a Soho studio where she would visit him two or three times a week, and it was on one of their regular date nights that he suffered a heart attack, while watching Carlito&apos;s Way at the Empire Leicester Square. Calman was in his 60s, she in her mid-40s. She talks about his death calmly, saying how much it helped that people were kind and behaved well afterwards \u2013 a stranger who held her hand while they waited in the dark for the ambulance later introduced himself to her at a party \u2013 and that there was no financial wrangling as they had kept their money separate. Although she has since had a long-term relationship with the Hungarian artist Csaba Pasztor, and has a current boyfriend, it is clear from her recent work that loneliness is on her mind. &quot;All I want is for people, when they read my books, to feel companioned, to feel they&apos;re not alone in the world,&quot; she says. &quot;[The American comedian and writer] Lily Tomlin said &apos;we&apos;re all in it together, alone&apos;. That could be my motto in life. It&apos;s not very ambitious but it&apos;s what I want to achieve.&quot; Moggach&apos;s return to novel-writing was triumphant. In 1999 she published Tulip Fever, a double love story set in Amsterdam in 1636, about a young woman who betrays her husband when she falls in love with an artist who gambles away their future on the tulip market. The subject, in the way that sometimes happens, caught the zeitgeist \u2013 gardening writer Anna Pavord published a non-fiction work on tulips at the same time, while Tracy Chevalier published the art-history-inspired novel The Girl With the Pearl Earring \u2013 and Moggach&apos;s pacy, romantic story became a bestseller. &quot;Tulip Fever did change my life,&quot; she says. &quot;It did that thing that sometimes happens when a book takes off \u2013 it opened doors on to whole other worlds. I would go to Amsterdam and suddenly the whole city opened up: people invited me to parties, I went to see the most amazing interiors of houses, I wandered around the Rembrandt museum after hours. It was very magical.&quot; The less magical postscript is that a long-promised film version has still not been made. Stephen Spielberg bought the rights and at one point it was about to go into production. Moggach and Chevalier had a bet that if one of their novels was filmed they would buy the other lunch. It is 10 years since Moggach was treated by Chevalier. To her delight her 2004 novel These Foolish Things made a speedier journey to the screen. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, filmed on location in Rajasthan and released a year ago, was a nominee in the Best British film category at the Baftas last weekend. Both film and book \u2013 renamed to match the film - did well commercially, which Moggach thinks surprised its producers, who hadn&apos;t realised how delighted older audiences would be by a romantic comedy about retirement starring Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy. But Moggach does not like being described and marketed as a popular novelist, any better than she likes being called a women&apos;s writer. She regards the plot of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which involves a group of sixtysomethings outsourcing themselves to a hotel in India, as a possible answer to Britain&apos;s care crisis.\u00a0&quot;My solution \u2013 to send the elderly to developing countries \u2013 actually makes sense,&quot; she wrote at the time. So what sort of writer is she? &quot;Not over-intellectual,&quot; she says. &quot;I think John Updike sometimes came a\u00a0cropper in that department. People spoke and thought too intelligently in\u00a0some of his books, you couldn&apos;t believe a boozy car salesman would have such nuanced and complex ideas, you felt this was Updike imposing them on him.&quot; Beryl Bainbridge was a role model: &quot;I think she&apos;s brilliant.&quot; And difficult to pigeonhole? &quot;Yes, I would like to be like that! I want people to be surprised by my work. Hilary Mantel was like that, until this latest extraordinary explosion of success. Each book was surprising, you couldn&apos;t see it coming.&quot; Moggach wrote another historical novel, In the Dark, set in a London boarding house during the first world war, before giving Buffy his second outing. She says: &quot;I&apos;ve had a very lucky life because I&apos;m of\u00a0this generation where everything was possible. We were sexually liberated, we were feminists, we could pick up any job we\u00a0liked. I liked waitressing, I\u00a0could always find journalistic work, I\u00a0bought\u00a0a house that went up in value\u00a0\u2013 all these things that kids don&apos;t\u00a0have nowadays. I worry hugely\u00a0about the next generation. My\u00a0daughter is just starting a career as\u00a0a novelist.&quot; But even the charmed life of a successful baby-boomer is not proof against shocks. Moggach&apos;s parents went through a vitriolic break-up late in life, and her mother Charlotte Hough was imprisoned for attempted murder in 1985 after she admitted helping a very sick old friend to kill herself. Getting old, Moggach says, is harder for women: &quot;I think it&apos;s incredibly unfair, because men my age and even a good deal older, however drooling and toothless and decrepit and boring and alcoholic and faithless they are, will still find a woman who wants to have sex with them \u2013 and she may even be a good deal younger! It just isn&apos;t the same for women. It&apos;s a very unpalatable fact of life.&quot; But she is proud of her life, and proud to have made a living from writing. She took out a mortgage to buy her house opposite Hampstead Heath, and paid a crowd of Pasztor&apos;s Hungarian friends to do it up for her.\u00a0She speaks approvingly of contemporaries prepared to make an effort, even if the world behaves as though they are invisible, and makes it clear she has no time for moaning. Buffy in Heartbreak Hotel may have been modelled on Calman, but meeting her after reading the novel one can&apos;t help but feel that there is a good deal of her in there too, struggling to tie up all the loose ends neatly. &quot;When you&apos;re thinking of all these different relationships and marriages, you&apos;ve been a different person in all of them,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s a very rich brew that&apos;s in your psyche by the time you&apos;re in your 60s and I think that&apos;s rather interesting. It makes you feel you&apos;ve lived a very long life, it&apos;s like going on holiday to three different cities rather than spending two weeks\u00a0in Lisbon. You look back on the holiday\u00a0and you seem to have been away forever.&quot;", "sentences": ["In 1999 she published Tulip Fever, a double love story set in Amsterdam in 1636, about a young woman who betrays her husband when she falls in love with an artist who gambles away their future on the tulip market.", "I would go to Amsterdam and suddenly the whole city opened up: people invited me to parties, I went to see the most amazing interiors of houses, I wandered around the Rembrandt museum after hours."], "title": "Deborah Moggach: a life in writing", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/16/deborah-moggach-life-in-writing", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-02-17T00:02:00Z", "article": "Planarians are freshwater flatworms of the order Tricladida, scavengers and predators on other invertebrates, hermaphroditic, and capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. They are distinguished from other flatworms by their trifurcate digestive tract and ovaries positioned in front of the brain. Familiar laboratory animals noted for their regenerative properties, they can be cut in half transversely with both head and tail halves developing into new whole worms, or split at the front to induce the development of two complete heads. Geneticists have recently identified key genes responsible for regeneration of the intestines with the hope of new insights into possible internal organ regeneration. And planarians caused quite a sensation in the 1960s when those conditioned to flashes of light and a simple maze retained the &quot;memory&quot; in regenerated worms and passed memory to other worms when eaten. While planarians remain fascinating laboratory subjects, much remains to be learned about their diversity in the wild. A newly discovered species, Phagocata flamenca, is a case in point. It was found in large numbers in Granada, Spain, in the well of an artificial spring fed by irrigation channels. The species is unusual, immediately recognisable, and memorably named. Its undulating lateral margins are approached only in one other freshwater planarian, Phagocata undulata from Lake Ohrid on the border of Macedonia and Albania. The latter species shares the wave-like folds along the margin but also has a bordering row of short, cone-shaped papillae absent in the new species. The flowing lateral lines of P\u00a0flamenca reminded the authors of the ruffles on the dresses worn by flamenco dancers \u2013 appropriately, coming from the region of Andaluc\u00eda,home of the art form. The species was described by Dr Miquel Vila Farr\u00e9 of the Universitat de Barcelona in collaboration with three colleagues from the University of Amsterdam, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, and the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid. The team conducted the most extensive inventory of freshwater planarians in the Iberian peninsula to date, describing six new species from Spain and assessing the status and distributions of five others. Their study reinforced the established view that lake species common elsewhere in Europe are indeed rare in Spain, adding periodic flooding and drought to previously offered explanations for their absence. Their work casts doubt on earlier records of three lake species in Spain and Portugal that were identified by external morphology alone and did not show up in new sampling. They did reveal the presence of a surprisingly diverse planarian stream fauna in the peninsula. In addition, their paper names two new species from Greece where the planarian fauna is similarly poorly studied.

The facility, part of a planned state-wide bookless system called BiblioTech, is modelled on an Apple store rather than a traditional library, but it will retain all the important features: more than 100 e-readers available to borrow, with more than 10,000 ebooks \u2013 and visitors can bring their own devices, too. Ebooks and libraries don&apos;t always mix well. Many libraries still mark a borrowed ebook as &quot;out&quot; (and therefore unavailable to other readers) just like a paper book, despite the electronic copy&apos;s infinite reproducibility. Others insist readers visit the actual building to download and &quot;check out&quot; ebooks. In 2011, HarperCollins tried to stipulate that its ebooks could only be borrowed 26 times. After this, the file would self-destruct, in accordance with the belief that this is the average lifespan of a worn-and-torn paper lending copy. There are obvious problems with applying the traditional library model to ebooks; but there are also very good reasons for retaining libraries. They are not just places to read books, they are public spaces providing a range of services. These are essential to people on lower incomes, beneficial to all, and they are adjusting to different roles. Amsterdam&apos;s Central Library, a magnificent building, the largest of its kind in Europe, opened in 2007, and emphasises the library as a space to work, think and connect. Books, while plentiful, could be secondary here: as much work is done by visitors online \u2013 spread across floor after floor of well-lit and well-connected desks and comfortable chairs \u2013 as with the collection. But there is no equivalent of public space online, which is too susceptible to corporate and technocratic control, and so the physical institution remains essential. The bookless library is not a contradiction in terms, but a continuation of the library&apos;s core purpose, providing access to knowledge and information, and a public statement of the value of that\u00a0access.

Following publication of my Guardian obituary for him, however, there was another reason for including Byrd in February&apos;s Take Five: the reaction to my throwaway use of the word &quot;bland&quot; to describe much of his hugely popular later work. Correspondent carygrant3000 cited adoption of Byrd&apos;s music by the likes of A Tribe Called Quest, J Dilla and Erykah Badu as examples of how deep into contemporary R&amp;B, neo-soul and hip-hop Byrd&apos;s influence had penetrated. Caravanserai observed: &quot;By the late 1960s any jazz musician who sold records was viewed as a sell-out by jazz snobs. Jazz stopped appealing to young people and is currently on life support. The critics, like the bloke who wrote this obituary, helped kill it.&quot; Hndrson posted: &quot;Miles took some abuse for his electric music, too. And he was later voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.&quot; If I had that obituary to write again, I wouldn&apos;t have used the word &quot;bland&quot; (not only a regrettably lazy dismissal of some much-loved music, as if Byrd wasn&apos;t entitled to change from a jazz player to something different, but also of the many people whose lives have been enriched by it). Moreover, bland ideas are hardly likely to have made a Byrd fan out of Badu \u2013 a creative artist comparable to Miles Davis in her virtuosity, imagination and determination never to become trapped in a single style. I&apos;d only maintain that the groove-based jazz of Miles Davis from the 70s on \u2013 or Weather Report or Herbie Hancock&apos;s Headhunters or, in the present era, Tim Berne, The Bad Plus, the British trio Troyka or the thrillingly entertaining Robert Glasper \u2013 hardly ever gets to sound like neatly hip jazz licks dropped between backbeats as Byrd&apos;s sometimes could. However tight and funky things get for those artists, the sense of expectations about to be derailed that makes life interesting is always just around the corner. But I meant it when I wrote in the obit that many young musicians today owe a debt to Donald Byrd for his lifelong mission to win respect and status for jazz. And thanks to diskdalek among the obituary&apos;s commenters, for highlighting the 1976 Byrd track Wild Life: a fine balance between this prolific and versatile artist&apos;s early and late enthusiasms. It&apos;s from his last Blue Note album, Caricatures \u2013 the great Gary Bartz is on alto sax.            Reading on a mobile? Watch here Bobby McFerrin Vocalist Bobby McFerrin comes to London&apos;s Barbican on 3 March with his SpiritYouAll project, inspired by the long history of the African American spiritual. When I first heard the young McFerrin in the 80s, he was the most dazzling one-man band and uncanny instrument mimic I&apos;d ever heard. He would delicately unfurl a Bach fugue \u2013 his voice translucent and rounded, like the upper register of a church organ \u2013 then launch into thunderous funk that made you imagine bass strings snapping on the fretboard. His sharp intakes of breath caught the clash of a closing hi-hat, a high-pitched buzz through his closed teeth created the vibrato of an electric guitar. He was personable, humorous and charming into the bargain \u2013 as he still is \u2013 and nothing this calm, creative individual has ever done sounds like a display of technique for the hell of it. Here&apos;s an example: McFerrin and Cameroonian singer-bassist Richard Bona improvising together at Montreal in 2003.            Reading on a mobile? Watch here Misha Mengelberg and the ICP As I previewed here last month, the current members of Holland&apos;s long-running Instant Composers Pool (ICP) \u2013 among the most influential catalysts to European free-improvised jazz \u2013 came to London for a five-night run at Dalston&apos;s Vortex jazz club. Pianist and ICP founder-member Misha Mengelberg, now 77 and latterly hampered by some mental wear and tear, was &quot;the ghost at the feast&quot; as one witness put it \u2013 he had come over with the group but nobody knew when, or if, he would take to the stage. The tantalising possibility of a Mengelberg appearance was no voyeuristic activity, but possibly a last chance for British audiences to cheer one of the true giants of European free-jazz in person. The Ukraine-born son of a German harpist and a classical composer/conductor, Mengelberg had moved from Kiev to Amsterdam with his family as pre-second-world-war tensions increased. Classical music seemed to be the boy&apos;s natural path (his great uncle Willem also conducted the Amsterdam Concertgebouw) but by the time he was at the Hague&apos;s Royal Conservatory in 1958, Mengelberg was already transcribing jazz solos from records. He appeared with his own quartet (including ICP drum legend Han Bennink) at the Newport jazz festival in 1966, and the following year \u2013 impelled by the young Dutch jazz scene&apos;s imaginative deployment of American free-jazz ideas \u2013 joined Bennink and saxophonist and clarinettist Willem Breuker in forming the ICP collective. So with grateful thanks to Jazz On 3, which recorded the whole final night, here&apos;s a clip from that concert \u2013 with a pretty perky-sounding Mengelberg still irrepressibly trickling and prodding around Michael Moore&apos;s saxophone on a twisted but identifiable Herbie Nichols bebop classic. You can catch the full show on Jazz On 3 on 1 April.      Reading on a mobile? Listen here Ellington in anticipation Mark Lockheart, the gifted saxophonist from Polar Bear, is also an original composer, and he gets better year on year, as his confident audacity with famous themes makes plain on a new album, Ellington in Anticipation. Lockheart is currently taking to the road with that session&apos;s fine band, including Polar Bear drummer Seb Rochford and pianist Liam Noble. Like Duke Ellington and his inheritor Gil Evans \u2013 two lifelong Lockheart models \u2013 the Englishman has developed a subtle balance of ensemble richness and improv freedoms for his hand-picked players. But Lockheart&apos;s Ellington tribute is what it uniquely is because he absorbed post-80s British and European jazz ideas too. Like the British composers Django Bates and Colin Towns (Lockheart was alongside Bates in Loose Tubes, and played in Towns&apos;s recent Blue Touch Paper) he freely juggles tempos, moods and idioms, from swing to folk music or circus struts, within the same piece without losing the plot. Here&apos;s a crucial source for that approach: Loose Tubes playing Django Bates&apos;s Sad Afrika, with a young Lockheart in the sax section.            Reading on a mobile? Watch here Nowhere near the edge When Stephen Poliakoff&apos;s jazz-themed drama series Dancing On the Edge began on BBC2, I posted some thoughts on the music&apos;s early-30s influence in Britain. The blog wound up with the hope that this might be an exciting and revealing drama with jazz at its core, and also have the incidental benefit of highlighting what was so exhilarating, liberating \u2013 and politically and socially explosive \u2013 about the music at that time.But as Jon Wilde&apos;s blog highlights, the series has been an unexpected damp squib \u2013 even eerily suggesting, in its later stages, that it has defied chronology and is being performed by a cast who&apos;ve read the reviews. Plenty has already been written about the series as a drama. But from a jazz perspective, it felt like a missed chance to let the music and its practitioners play a more creative role in developing Poliakoff&apos;s powerful themes. Even one or two raucous after-hours scenes of Louis Lester&apos;s band jamming somewhere rough and dodgy in the company of listeners who don&apos;t look like waxworks could have offered other perspectives on class, race and the power of music to shake social rigidities. Sure, jazz was undoubtedly watered down for London&apos;s posh restaurants and hotels, but there was an uninhibited low-life to the city too, and its more downmarket habitues knew a lot about jazz musicians, and about cosmopolitanism, by this time. Recalling the London trip he made in 1933, Duke Ellington reflected fondly on Wardour Street&apos;s out-of-hours entertainments to Swing magazine: &quot;The Jiggs Club \u2013 that is the lowest place. I don&apos;t know of any place in America that is down to that level \u2026 I took the whole mob down one night. We would go from scotch to brandy to gin \u2013 and I&apos;m not forgetting the black-eyed peas. The joint was owned by Alex, an English Jew, and an African guy.&quot; What a welcome antidote to the champagne, candelabras, elegant corridors and even more elegant elocution a shot of that would have been \u2013 and how revealingly a sub-plot from that world might have opened up Poliakoff&apos;s intended story, too. Dancing On the Edge&apos;s music associate Andrew Johnston has suggested that central character Louis Lester might have heard Duke Ellington in New York, and modelled his band on it. If he did, he couldn&apos;t have been paying attention. Here&apos;s the Ellington band in 1929, showing how many exuberant voices it could deploy at once, on The Dicty Glide.

The newly created Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences Foundation on Wednesday announces the first 11 winners of an award intended to inject excitement into the sometimes lonely, underfunded quests to understand and combat cancer, diabetes, Parkinson&apos;s disease and other maladies. Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook; Brin, who co-founded Google; and Milner, a venture capitalist, have dipped into their fortunes to sponsor awards worth $3m each, compared with a Nobel prize&apos;s monetary value of $1.1m. &quot;With the mapping of the genome sequence there are expectations of significant progress in the next 10 or 20 years so I think the timing is really appropriate to create an incentive for the best scientific minds,&quot; Milner told the Guardian in an interview on the eve of the announcement. A Russian internet investor who quit a PhD in physics and invested in social networking, Milner persuaded his fellow internet billionaires to contribute to the bounty to encourage a new generation of molecular biologists and geneticists. &quot;Young people will hopefully get the message that not only the careers in sports or entertainment can get a public recognition.&quot; Milner, who has homes in Moscow and California, distributed prizes last year for the field of fundamental physics. They too were each worth $3m, with nine inaugural winners receiving a total of $27m. They formed a committee to choose the winner, or joint winners, of the single annual prize established for future years. Milner decided to repeat the model on a bigger scale for life sciences. &quot;Unfortunately I have two very close relatives with very bad diseases, one of them is cancer. This is part of my personal connection with this prize.&quot; To honour the 11 scientists named on Wednesday, who will collectively receive $33m, he reached out to Zuckerberg, whom he has known since buying a $200m stake in Facebook in 2009. He also enlisted Brin, a Russian American entrepreneur, despite Google&apos;s occasionally testy relations with Facebook. Brin&apos;s wife, Anne Wojcicki, was named as a fourth sponsor. They will split the cost of the inaugural prizes and of subsequent five annual awards, totalling $15m. &quot;Yuri drove this,&quot; said Art Levinson, the chairman of Apple, who will also chair the new foundation. It marked an unusual philanthropic alliance in Silicon Valley, he said. &quot;In my recollection this has not happened before.&quot; The prize was intended to make a statement. &quot;It&apos;s a lot of money, yes. But the people who make game-changing contributions are often scientists who toil without much recognition or fanfare and without much compensation. To my mind these are the true heroes,&quot; said Levinson. Recipients, who hail from the United States, Japan, Italy and the Netherlands, expressed shock and delight when told of the awards, which will be officially announced on Wednesday at a press conference in San Francisco. &quot;I had to sit down on the floor for a while. I thought it must be a practical joke or a Nigerian scam,&quot; said Cornelia Bargmann, 51, who has pioneered work on neural circuits and behaviour at the Rockefeller University. &quot;The scale of this is so outsized I think it will have a huge impact on the life sciences.&quot; Asked how she would spend the money she hesitated. &quot;It&apos;s so far outside my normal planning I don&apos;t know. Get the car fixed?&quot; Hans Clevers, 55, professor of Molecular Genetics at the Hubrecht Institute, who has broken ground in stem cell research and colon cancer, said he had recovered since Levinson notified him last week. &quot;It&apos;s sunk in a little bit. When I asked him about the money he said it&apos;s meant to make life easy.&quot; Clevers said he would use some of the windfall to invite about 150 collaborators to a symposium in Amsterdam. &quot;We&apos;ll have a big party.&quot; The announcement will come just days before the Oscars but is more likely to steal limelight from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences&apos; Nobel awards. Anyone online can nominate someone for a Breakthrough prize and organisers envisage winners will tend to be scientists still in their prime rather than retired scientists honoured for decades-old research. There is no limit on the number of people who can share a prize, in contrast to the Nobel which caps it at three. Each year&apos;s winners will join an ever-expanding selection committee to vote, in secret, on future winners. Unlike Stockholm there will be no elaborate ceremony in San Francisco but winners will be expected to give talks and interviews during the year. Lewis Cantley, director of the cancer centre at Weill Cornell Medical College, whose work on mutated pathways could help tackle diabetes and other genetic disorders, said he was overwhelmed when notified of the news. &quot;I almost fell over. I didn&apos;t even know this prize existed.&quot; He turned 64 on Wednesday.Titia de Lange, 57, who researches cell biology, genetics and cancer at Rockefeller university, said the award felt surreal. &quot;I&apos;m not used to having a lot of money. I don&apos;t really have possessions.&quot; Two women from a list of 11 fairly reflected the percentage of women working at that level, she said. &quot;One would like it to be higher of course.&quot; One of the oldest recipients, David Botstein, 70, a doyen of genomics on sabbatical from Princeton, expressed some unease about the amount of money and said he would give some of it away. He thanked the sponsors but lamented that such a payout was needed to shine media and public attention the life sciences. &quot;Over the past 30 or 40 years there has been very rapid progress but you just don&apos;t hear about it.&quot; Breakthrough Prize: full list of the inaugural winners 1 Cornelia I BargmannTorsten N Wiesel professor and head of the Lulu and Anthony Wang Laboratory of Neural Circuits and Behaviour at the Rockefeller University.

As someone who&apos;s been raving about the environmental and creative potential of persuading people to repair things for a few years now, it&apos;s great to see this idea gaining traction. It&apos;s time for more businesses to sit up and take note, but not necessarily for the reasons you might think. This movement towards a new culture of repair is characterised by a deep sense of purpose. Yet if you listen to stories coming from the existing community, it&apos;s not just about pragmatic problem solving \u2013 it&apos;s also fun and empowering. Out on the streets there are repair cafes popping up from London to New York to Amsterdam; social events where you can bring your toaster or vacuum cleaner along and someone will teach you how to fix it while you enjoy a beer and a chat are booming. Online communities such as Instructables and Sugru are growing fast with thousands of step-by-step guides, all made by ordinary people who want to share their experiences of fixing and making to help others do the same. Late last year we published the Fixer&apos;s Manifesto, to fuel the conversation about why a culture of repairing and improving is so important. It went on to become our most popular and widely shared content to date. This reflects the growing appetite for reconsidering how we approach consumable products. Why fixing? And why now? It&apos;s partly due to a frustration with how much waste is created by our throwaway culture \u2013 and of course the economic downturn means we all think more about saving money \u2013 but there&apos;s something else going on too, something even more profound. We could be witnessing the birth of a re-imagined make do and mend movement for the 21st century, where the incentive is no longer just thrift, but the growing value in (and sense of achievement from) making the most of what we have. It&apos;s also about making the most of ourselves \u2013 our pragmatism and lateral thinking. In the three years or so since we launched sugru, we&apos;ve heard thousands of stories from people who excitedly contact us to tell us their sugru story, often taking considerable time and effort to include pictures and videos, and specific details of their particular problem and how they found a solution themselves. Whether it&apos;s fixing an electric toothbrush, a laptop charger, or a pair of favourite hiking boots, we realised after a while that all the stories had one thing in common \u2013 an infectious sense of pride and achievement. Fixing things gives people a thrill \u2013 there&apos;s a feel-good sense of having beaten the system in some small way, and we&apos;ve found that those who try it want to show off what they accomplish. At a time when most of us spend our days working on a computer, mainly working towards intangible outcomes \u2013 it seems we crave the satisfaction of solving a physical problem, or creating something physical \u2013 literally, having something to show for ourselves. Someone phrased it nicely to me earlier today: a seemingly small win, like a fixed laptop charger, becomes a big win just by solving the problem. It&apos;s this sense of personal achievement that has allowed sugru to become so successful in such a short space of time (selling more than 2m individual mini-packs of over the last two and half years by word of mouth alone and no advertising budget). If half of the mini-packs we&apos;ve sold were used to prolong the life of something then that&apos;s a significant impact. Especially when you consider the things that are fixed are often large, complex and expensive goods such as dishwashers, fridges and car parts, many of which often end up in landfill. If all those people have gained confidence as problem solvers, just think what the social and economic impact could be \u2013 for you and your business. It&apos;s something that Ideo&apos;s founder, David Kelley, refers to as the power of creative confidence. Most of the fixes and improvements we&apos;ve seen across our own community and others online have been in the home environment, but what if business embraced fixing? My hunch is that the impact might be surprising. Jane n\u00ed Dhulchaointigh is the inventor and chief executive of sugru This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Some works were designed for an intimate audience: Mental was staged in a bedroom, for an audience of just 12, all huddled under a king-size duvet; while Dead Line offered a one-on-one telephone conversation with a specialist on the subject of death. Over in the more conventional theatre spaces there was intimacy of the genital kind. In How To Become a Cupcake, the self-styled Famous Lauren Barri Holstein inserted a Twister lolly into her vagina and spent several minutes melting it with a hairdryer. Kein Applaus Fur Scheisse, by two young graduates from the School for New Dance Development in Amsterdam, contained a sequence in which the boy vomited bright blue liquid over the girl&apos;s stomach, before urinating directly into her mouth. Clearly this isn&apos;t art for everyone \u2013 either on grounds of accessibility or taste. Yet In Between Time is one of Arts Council England&apos;s National Portfolio Organisations, a status that would seem to carry certain responsibilities: towards wider audiences, and social engagement. It&apos;s a responsibility that the four women who run IBT, led by director Helen Cole, take very seriously. They do this in quite pragmatic ways: IBT now has an associate artist scheme, through which several Bristol-based artists (including performance duo Action Hero, and Alex Bradley, who works in digital installation) were invited to present work at this year&apos;s festival. Some of that work was integral to opening up access to IBT: Bradley&apos;s Field Test was a light-and-sound piece created for a churchyard that anyone who happened to be passing could enjoy.  Unexpectedly, even these outdoor events contributed to IBT&apos;s sense of intimacy: Simon Faithfull&apos;s Fake Moon gave the impression that a faraway satellite had defied gravity to draw close to us; while Kate McIntosh&apos;s Work Table invited passers-by into a series of small shipping containers, where they could have fun destroying objects before trying to remake them.  What Cole and her team understand exceptionally well is the need to challenge audiences \u2013 whether with work of quiet fragility, or work that is aggressive and contradictory. More than that, they understand that challenging art needs protection: the fragile, to ensure that its voice can be heard in the push towards art that is easier to consume; the aggressive, because it antagonises social boundaries and questions the limits otherwise placed on freedom and imagination. Importantly, traditional theatres are waking up to the need not just to talk about risk but offer audiences that challenge. Later this week, West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds announces the programme for the third Transform, a two-week festival that has brought new life into the building \u2013 not only in terms of the kinds of work shown, but the people coming to see it, many of whom spend the rest of the year ignoring the Playhouse&apos;s existence. Much of the excitement that surrounds Erica Whyman joining the Royal Shakespeare Company and Vicky Featherstone moving into the Royal Court in London stems from the fact that both challenged audiences to expand their ideas about theatre in their previous homes, respectively Northern Stage and National Theatre of Scotland.  Perhaps nothing in theatre is more challenging than intimacy. The works at IBT made audiences think about attitudes towards the representation of women, porn, mental health, youth and death, in unusual and thrilling ways. Isn&apos;t this the vital function of art? At the heart of the festival was an installation, constructed by Helen Cole herself, called We See Fireworks, in which disembodied voices described encounters with experimental art. One by one, they talked of being deeply moved, having their way of thinking changed, becoming more receptive to the world around them. Such stories remind us why it&apos;s so important to accept the challenge of art \u2013 and to allow that art the opportunity to exist.", "sentences": ["Kein Applaus Fur Scheisse, by two young graduates from the School for New Dance Development in Amsterdam, contained a sequence in which the boy vomited bright blue liquid over the girl&apos;s stomach, before urinating directly into her mouth."], "title": "How far should theatre push us?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2013/feb/20/how-far-should-theatre-push-us", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-02-24T00:05:00Z", "article": "Olivia Bee is not your typical American teenager. For one thing, people want to hear what she has to say \u2013 and are willing to pay for the privilege. A good thing, too, since the disarmingly self-assured 18-year-old has plenty to say. Already financially independent and living in Brooklyn, New York (she&apos;s originally from Portland, Oregon), Bee takes photographs, often of friends, which lean towards the documentary but have a foothold in art. She&apos;s been doing it since the age of 11. &quot;I took a photography class in sixth grade, and I started putting the pictures on Flickr, to show people what was going on in my life.&quot; She quickly established a cult following and by 15, she had turned professional. Nan Goldin is a major influence, but while Goldin&apos;s photographs portrayed the seamier side of sex and drugs and rock&apos;n&apos;roll, Bee finds a dreamlike, innocent colour in her friends&apos; gently dissolute experimentation. There are no grimy bedsits or drug paraphernalia on show here; she makes being a teenager look bohemian and enticing. Beautiful youth is a marketing man&apos;s dream, of course, and so at breakneck speed she has taken the art \u2013 and advertising \u2013 worlds by storm. Given that so many established photographers want to break into the lucrative world of advertising, it&apos;s a remarkable achievement. How did it happen? &quot;Converse&apos;s ad agency, VSA, saw my stuff on Flickr and kept emailing me saying they wanted to work with me. I thought it was spam \u2013 I didn&apos;t know what an ad agency was, let alone VSA Partners,&quot; she shrugs. &quot;Eventually Converse emailed me: &apos;Did you get the emails from our ad agency? Why aren&apos;t you responding?&apos; Only then did I get it. And so when they did a shoot in Portland [where she was at school] they brought me on set and had me shoot some stuff.&quot; Since Converse took that gamble on her at the age of 15, she has shot campaigns for, among others, Nike, Subaru, Levis and Herm\u00e8s (&quot;They sent me 30 scarves and said, do what you like&quot;), her work has been exhibited all over the world and she has an ongoing series in Le Monde. Last December, she addressed around 300 women at a TedX conference in Amsterdam: &quot;Nothing gets in my way,&quot; she told them, &quot;because I don&apos;t accept anything getting in my way.&quot; She means it, too. She recently dispensed with a model on an Adidas shoot because she felt she wasn&apos;t listening to her. To say that she&apos;s an achiever would be something of an understatement. In January, she shot Girls star (and David Mamet&apos;s daughter) Zosia Mamet for the New York Times magazine. This seems a perfect fit \u2013 if Bee wasn&apos;t taking pictures of the girls in Girls, she&apos;d probably be one of the girls in Girls. It&apos;s easy to imagine Jessa from that show taking snaps of the other characters, casually hitting the zeitgeist and going stratospheric. But, unlike those actors and contrary to the claims of some sceptics, Bee isn&apos;t &quot;connected&quot;. Her father works in IT and her mother is a hairdresser. Until she turned 18, one of them would chaperone her as she juggled paid assignments with homework. &quot;It was a legality thing. I also had to have a schoolteacher accompany me. It was kind of what actors have to do when they&apos;re under 18. My parents have been great. They don&apos;t help unless I ask for it, they let me do my own thing.&quot; The work did take its toll on her studies, however. &quot;For a few years, I was a straight-A student but then photos got in the way. I was pretty good at maths and science. I was a good reader and I&apos;m really good at writing and art. I was not good at PE and music class could be stressful. I was pretty academically inclined and smart overall.&quot; Even with such preternatural confidence, directing people is difficult at any age, especially in the macho world of photography, so where does her authority come from? &quot;I&apos;m an assertive person and I know what I want. And I&apos;m going to get what I want if I can. I know how to do that. Being 18 and a girl can be really hard. People don&apos;t take me seriously \u2013 until they see me work. Sometimes, even if they&apos;ve seen my work, they&apos;re still nervous and have to convince their client it&apos;s OK, or they have to lie about it,&quot; she says, candidly. &quot;Obviously it&apos;s probably hard to trust me straightaway. I know I&apos;m good at my job and I know someone could put any prop in front of me and I could shoot it in a way I think is successful. But it&apos;s still hard. Most photos in advertising are shot by 50-year-old men and I&apos;m not a 50-year-old man.&quot; Professional jealousy has also been an issue, unsurprisingly. &quot;When I got the Fiat 500 campaign, a lot of men were very angry because a girl who had just turned 17 got that job and they didn&apos;t. When I turned 18, it was a little less of a problem \u2013 I was then a very young adult. But often people think I&apos;m\u00a0a PA or a very small model.&quot; She may be part of the Instagram generation, but she prefers the timeless quality that film brings to her pictures. &quot;It lends itself to memory; it&apos;s magical. I want to evoke nostalgia in everyone, and to take photos you can relate to, regardless of your situation, your gender, race, where you grew up, whether you&apos;re a teenager\u2026&quot; Like most high-achievers, she thinks big \u2013 her ambition is not limited to photography. &quot;I will make movies at some point,&quot; she declares breezily. &quot;I want to make a feature film.

How wrong we were. This shadowy, brutal and fearless jihadist group, which kidnapped seven French citizens in northern Cameroon last week and has killed thousands of innocents on its native soil, has made a mockery of the once-widespread conviction that no Nigerian on the planet was religious, brave or selfless enough to sacrifice his or her life for a cause. Even when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a young Nigerian al-Qaida devotee, was caught trying to detonate a bomb on a US-bound flight in 2009, almost every Nigerian I spoke to at the time suspected that he got cold feet and deliberately sabotaged the mission. The &quot;evidence&quot; that fed this suspicion was that, having boarded the plane in Amsterdam, he sat on it for several hours, started to fiddle around with the bomb he had concealed in his underwear only when Detroit airport was in sight, and then handled the detonation exercise so ineptly that another passenger was able to subdue him fairly easily. Abuja, Nigeria&apos;s capital city, is in the north-central part of the country. I lived there for 12 years until October 2011. And I witnessed Boko Haram dispelling the above myth, becoming a terrifying force and seriously undermining the public&apos;s confidence in President Goodluck Jonathan. Boko Haram has notched up some spectacular successes. It has blown up the United Nations building in Abuja. It has gained entry to Abuja&apos;s police headquarters. And its outrages have had an enormous psychological impact on the nation. Many believe the movement is invincible. At one point the Hilton hotel was almost deserted because of fears it would be targeted. Meanwhile, foreign airline crews stopped sleeping over in Abuja and several children were sent abroad to school by frightened parents. Boko Haram has now stepped up its campaign, with an aggressive and high-profile incursion into foreign territory. On Tuesday the group released a video of the hostages in which the kidnapping was described as retribution for France&apos;s military intervention in Mali. The borders that separate Nigeria from its neighbours have always been porous. But, until last week&apos;s audacious Cameroonian abduction, the insurgents had restricted their terror campaign to northern Nigeria. The churches they attacked were always in the north. They didn&apos;t venture to the south, where most Nigerian Christians live. But the fear is they may now start to do so. If they are now crossing borders to hunt for expatriate hostages whose capture guarantees them maximum publicity on an international level, might they not also soon make an attempt to similarly expand their activities into southern Nigeria? Boko Haram has hitherto murdered more fellow Muslims \u2013 spiritual leaders included \u2013 than &quot;infidels&quot;. But some observers are expecting this to change. The Nigerian government participated in the assault on Malian Muslim rebels trying to halt the spread of fundamentalism in West Africa \u2013 and in so doing, deprive Boko Haram of one of its recruiting and training grounds and arms supply routes. But it is difficult to predict whether the desired results can be achieved and sustained. Meanwhile, Muslim Nigerians from the north are as concerned about the Boko Haram threat as Nigerians in the south. According to Hassan Mohammed, a judge from the north-east: &quot;It is laughable to describe these characters as pro-north or as defenders of Islam. They are evil anarchists who have not only killed almost every imam in the Maiduguri area, but are hellbent on eliminating our political and traditional rulers as well.&quot; And he adds: &quot;The northern elite is often accused of being in cahoots with Boko Haram \u2026 but nothing could be further from the truth. Why would we stupidly support terrorists who treat us like hated opponents and are always trying to kill us?&quot; Some believe Boko Haram is partly about hungry, angry, unemployed northern boys saying &quot;enough is enough&quot; in a country that is lamentably corrupt, with the privileged callously ignoring the poor. But Nigeria, sadly, is not going to become an oasis of enlightenment any time soon; and if a relatively sophisticated country such as Britain took decades to neutralise the IRA, it may take Nigeria at least as long to bring the homicidal and suicidal guerrilla fighters of Boko Haram to heel. Boko Haram is a strange, amorphous, hydra-headed beast that is feeding off Nigeria&apos;s many problems and grievances and has just demonstrated that it is willing and able to spread its terror campaign to new regions. Many people are pessimistic about it being vanquished in the forseeable future.", "sentences": ["The &quot;evidence&quot; that fed this suspicion was that, having boarded the plane in Amsterdam, he sat on it for several hours, started to fiddle around with the bomb he had concealed in his underwear only when Detroit airport was in sight, and then handled the detonation exercise so ineptly that another passenger was able to subdue him fairly easily."], "title": "Nigeria underestimated Boko Haram's brutal power | Donu Kogbara", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/28/nigeria-underestimated-boko-haram", "tags": ["Boko Haram", "Nigeria", "Africa", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-03-01T12:46:29Z", "article": "Galley Bay Cottages, Antigua Tucked away on a hillside in a quiet area of north-west Antigua \u2013 and a stone&apos;s throw from Giorgio Armani&apos;s cliffside estate \u2013 Galley Bay Cottages are a rare find on an island where pricey all-inclusives and super-high-end resorts seem to dominate.

Three bedrooms and two bathrooms make it comfortable for families or couples. The grocery stores in Codrington, Barbuda&apos;s quiet main village, are fairly limited, so guests often stock up on basics beforehand in Antigua, about 30 miles away (daily flights; ferry five days a week).

Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas would follow him to White Hart Lane, as would the midfielder Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who he has known for most of his life. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, had floated the idea of playing Vertonghen in midfield, which did not appeal, while Tottenham proposed that he become their cornerstone in central defence. Vertonghen has started more Premier League matches at left-back. He even enjoyed a light-hearted squabble with Gareth Bale in the early season about who least wanted to play in the position. Bale, initially, was chosen to answer the selection problem. Whatever happened to him? Vertonghen is consumed by a sense of destiny as he enters Sunday&apos;s pivotal derby against Arsenal at White Hart Lane. He stands on the brink of achievement at domestic level, just as he does with Belgium, who after a string of qualification failures have seen a gifted crop of players come together to fire optimism for the 2014 World Cup. Tottenham have threatened in the past only to find ways of falling short. The derby at roughly the same stage of last season, albeit at Emirates Stadium, finished in a 5-2 defeat and was the prompt for a 10-point advantage in third place over Arsenal to be squandered. The consequences were well documented and devastating, yet Vertonghen is convinced that things will be different this time. &quot;I have the same feeling at Tottenham that I do with Belgium, that we are in a strong team and we&apos;re getting stronger, that we&apos;re on the verge of something,&quot; he says. &quot;A few results have helped us. We won at Manchester United and, with Belgium, we beat Holland at home. Everybody can feel that Spurs are getting stronger, not only inside the club but also at other clubs. Even in the Belgium team, we get the respect. Teams are not happy when they have to face us.&quot; Vertonghen believes that the sentiment applies to Arsenal, who seem to drain the gamut of emotions every week. The pressure is suffocating, more so, in Vertonghen&apos;s view, than that at Tottenham, who represent the challenger, the coming force, and it has manifested itself in the anxiety of the Arsenal support and Wenger&apos;s behaviour. His outburst on the eve of the Champions League tie against Bayern Munich, when he sensed conspiracy against his club, was noted with glee at White Hart Lane. &quot;It gives you a lift,&quot; Vertonghen says. &quot;We look at ourselves but then we see the opponent is under pressure, in trouble, and you want to take advantage of that. I hope we can put them under a lot of pressure in the game. Because we are not the team who finished first or second for the last 10 years, we are not under the pressure Arsenal are, but we put ourselves under pressure because we deserve to be up there and have the qualities to play in the Champions League.&quot; Vertonghen mentions the Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy&apos;s refusal to sell Luka Modric to Chelsea in the summer of 2011, in the face of a \u00a340m offer, when he discusses where he sees the club and what persuaded him to join them from Ajax. Although Modric forced a \u00a330m move to Real Madrid last August, Vertonghen felt that the defiance of a domestic rival had sent a &quot;very big signal&quot;. &quot;A few clubs were interested in signing me,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t really want to talk about Arsenal. I chose Tottenham because they gave me a very good feeling from the beginning. They invited me, they showed me how badly they wanted me. I had a feeling that they were building something.&quot; Vertonghen was quoted in December as saying that &quot;Arsenal wanted me to be a controller in the midfield, an Emmanuel Petit-type,&quot; but he was clear that\u00a0he wanted to press for a starting place in central defence. &quot;They had Vermaelen,&quot; Vertonghen says. &quot;I knew it would be very difficult for me to play in central defence if the captain and one of their best players plays there. You mention that when we were talking with clubs and then they say: &apos;Yeah, but you can play somewhere else?&apos; I wanted clubs to get me not just for the bench but for the position I wanted to play.&quot; The \u00a310m transfer to Tottenham became protracted when Ajax brazenly refused to pay Vertonghen the percentage of the fee that was stipulated in his contract. The 25-year-old was forced to accept a compromise. But the deal was in place before Tottenham appointed Villas-Boas to replace Harry Redknapp, even if it was announced after the managerial appointment. &quot;I didn&apos;t know that Villas-Boas was going to be the manager,&quot; Vertonghen admits. &quot;I signed for the club. But I was very happy when he came. I had Frank de Boer for the last two seasons at Ajax and he played in a similar way. Villas\u2011Boas wants to play possession and get defenders involved in that possession.&quot; Vertonghen&apos;s adaptation to the English game and its unforgiving schedule has been impressive, as has the uncomplaining manner in which he has coped with being switched between centre-half and left-back. It began at home to Queens Park Rangers on 23 September when, with Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto and Kyle Naughton injured, Villas-Boas had to perm from a pair of reluctant left-backs. &quot;Gareth and I were joking about it,&quot; Vertonghen says, but the match would become a reference point for him and the club. Bale started at left-back, QPR led 1-0 at half-time and Tottenham were booed off. Villas-Boas, though, moved Vertonghen from the middle into the position for the second-half, he liberated Bale and watched the team win 2-1. Vertonghen has almost always played in central defence in the Europa League but 12 of his 23 league starts have come at left-back. There is an edge about Vertonghen, a competitive streak that rages inside of him. He has needed it on his professional journey and the strength of his character was never more evident than when he moved to Amsterdam at 16. He was sent to school in the Bijlmer, which he describes as the &quot;ghetto neighbourhood&quot; and was a wild contrast to his upbringing in the Belgian village of Tielrode. &quot;I can be quite fiery,&quot; he says. &quot;I was worse when I was younger but even now, when there is a bad decision from \u2026 it doesn&apos;t matter who, I sometimes want to scream. I have never fought in my life but I can be very angry, especially on the pitch.&quot; One story from his early career stands out. &quot;I had a very difficult time when Henk ten Cate was my manager at Ajax [in 2006-07] and I was never in the squad,&quot; he says. &quot;I took the decision to go on loan to RKC Waalwijk [for the second-half of the season], I played and, after that, I became a starting player at Ajax. I scored against Ajax in the fourth last game of that season, in a 2-2 draw, and Ten Cate was probably angry because Ajax missed the title on goal difference. That&apos;s who I am. If I play, even at left-back, I do my best. And, of course, I had a bit of tension. I wanted to show Ajax I was a good player.&quot; Vertonghen speaks warmly of Liverpool&apos;s Luis Su\u00e1rez, a team-mate at Ajax and kindred spirit, in regards to his mentality and liking of &quot;a laugh and a joke&quot;, while he is reverential about Jaap Stam, who finished his career at the Amsterdam club. &quot;He showed us what a big superstar is about both on and off the pitch.&quot; Vertonghen is settled in the smart north London area of Belsize Park, although it is indicative that he and his girlfriend, Sophie, who he met at school in the Bijlmer, have chosen the Camden Town side of it. Like them, Camden is individualistic. Sophie is from the Bijlmer and she works there in theatre workshops with children; she splits her time now between London and Amsterdam. Vertonghen, too, has relished providing inspiration to young people via his involvement with the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation. Over in Hampstead, Vertonghen sees his compatriots Vermaelen and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and little sign of a north London divide. &quot;They&apos;re all there,&quot; he says &quot;Vermaelen, [Lukas] Podolski, [Per] Mertesacker \u2026 [Emmanuel] Adebayor, [William] Gallas, Mousa. I&apos;ve known Thomas since I played in Belgium; for 10 years now. He went to the school in the Bijlmer and I was with him at Ajax. But I have the same with Mousa. I&apos;ve known him for 13 years. It&apos;s funny. A lot of players live there [in Hampstead] so sometimes you see them. But we live in peace.&quot; The gloves come off on Sunday at White Hart Lane.

At least those of us who live in Britain are. This is because, in the 21st century, efficient, large, well-connected airports matter to prosperity above everything else. &quot;The fastest, best-connected places will win&quot;, and the future belongs to the &quot;city that can see the writing on the wall before the competition can even see the wall&quot;. While China is roaring away with $250bn of investment in airports, London finds the efforts to improve its infrastructure mired in environmental\u00a0opposition, political indecision and local special interest groups. And, with London, so goes the entire UK economy. So, almost, says John Kasarda, travelling preacher for the concept\u00a0of aerotropolis, the idea that a new type of city will and must appear, where &quot;the airport is not at its periphery but at its core&quot;. He\u00a0combines\u00a0a professorship\u00a0at the University of North Carolina with writing books and articles on the subject, with a consultancy advising regional and national governments how to direct their billions to the achievement of their own aerotropolis.\u00a0Boris Johnson has declared his enthusiasm for the idea, and Kasarda reciprocates his passion: &quot;I find the mayor of London extremely visionary. He has his\u00a0finger on the pulse. He has a dramatic style, but he&apos;s a very wise man.&quot; There is, Kasarda says, a &quot;new metric based on time and cost&quot;, and &quot;location, location, location has been replaced by accessibility, accessibility, accessibility&quot;. Kasarda supports his arguments with batteries of statistics and predictions \u2013 that in 2030 there will be 13bn passenger journeys a year, compared with 4.9bn in 2010,\u00a0or that an iPhone 5 is assembled from parts flown in from several countries.     Arlanda airport in Sweden, a popular wedding venue. Photograph: Alamy    As airports grow, argues Kasarda, they become more city-like. The shopping zone of Indianapolis International, he says, &quot;really gives the feeling&quot; of a town square. There are 6,000 weddings a year at Stockholm Arlanda, the Rijksmuseum exhibits art in Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, and the London Philharmonic is performing at Heathrow. &quot;If you want to see the future,&quot; he says, &quot;look at the Squaire&quot; \u2013 a sleek, glassy slug in Frankfurt where KPMG has moved some of its operations, on the basis that it is only a few minutes&apos; walk from workplace to check-in.     The Squaire, an office building inside Frankfurt airport: 'minutes' walk from workplace to check-in'. Photograph: Alamy    Kasarda&apos;s favourite examples of an aerotropolis are Las Colinas, Texas, which is handily placed for Dallas Fort Worth and &quot;hosts four Global Fortune 500 headquarters&quot;, and New Songdo, a development built (with advice from Kasarda) near Incheon airport in South Korea. Also, Dubai, &quot;an airport with an emirate attached&quot;, and Singapore, whose growth has been assisted by its impressive airport. He shows a plan of an ideal city, with runways at its dead centre and &quot;aerolanes&quot; connecting such things as &quot;E-fulfilment facilities&quot; and a &quot;medical and wellness cluster&quot;. This city is shown as being built on virgin greensward, a site very unlike London, which already has a large number of buildings and services, and people who might resist relocation. Kasarda calls the existing fabric &quot;sunk cost&quot;, which roughly means &quot;money down the drain&quot;, before acknowledging that they might have some value: &quot;You can&apos;t get rid of it, so you have to leverage it as best you can.&quot;     Dubai International, 'an airport with an emirate attached'. Photograph: Corbis    Kasarda is right that international air travel is a growing force, and that London will suffer if it fails to find an intelligent response. But, as currently described, aerotropolis is chilling: a model of a city driven by a combination\u00a0of business imperatives and state control, with the high levels of security\u00a0and control that go with airports. Under the dictatorship of speed, individual memory and identity\u00a0are abolished. An airport shopping mall is, actually, not like a town square, for the reason that everything there is programmed and managed, and spontaneity and initiative are abolished. There may be palliatives. According to Kasarda&apos;s 10 points for planning aerotropolises, &quot;thematic architectural features, public art and iconic structures should make aerotropolis developments interpretable, navigable and welcoming&quot;. New Songdo includes a Jack Nicklaus golf course and areas modelled on Venetian canals and Central Park. But, according to sociologist Richard Sennett, it&apos;s a &quot;stupefying&quot; place where &quot;there is nothing to be learned from walking the streets&quot;. Nor are airport cities precisely pure expressions of the market, as some 19th-century railway towns were. The South Korean government has invested heavily in New Songdo, which has yet to prove that it will be the humming metropolis promised by its makers. Of the plan to build a new airport in the Thames estuary, Kasarda tells me that &quot;most airport transportation connectivity will need to be based on public funding, and this will be expensive. I know of no significant commercial airport that has been privately built that had not received substantial public funding support, at least indirectly.&quot; The deal, in other words, is this: taxpayers would be expected to pay handsomely for an environment created almost entirely to serve the needs of business. If they don&apos;t, as Kasarda says of a Britain without enhanced airports in London, &quot;the city and nation\u00a0will become markedly weakened in the coming decades&quot;. And if the public does foot the bill, the bet might not pay off. &quot;The Thames estuary airport is a high-risk but potentially\u00a0very high-return option,&quot; says Kasarda. In\u00a0other words, the taxpayer might be asked to stake billions upon billions on something that may not work. When London meets aerotropolis, it is quite a face-off. If the game is simply to see who can build airports (and eve rything that goes with them) biggest, fastest and most efficiently, then London, which carries the baggage of history and democracy, cannot beat Asian cities. On the other hand, London has qualities to which the aerotropolis idea adds little value, like an existing fabric that works and gives pleasure and affords space for the accidental (including the colossal and largely unplanned success,\u00a0over the decades, of Heathrow). The evidence of property prices, and of international investment,\u00a0is that these things are worth quite a lot. London can never afford to be complacent \u2013 not least about the current state of its airports \u2013 but the aerotropolis idea offers a too simplistic view of cities.

Plus a feeling, yet again, that Hollywood has made us all bit players in a media world where power \u2013 and markets and money \u2013 homogenise lives. How did British actors get so good at American accents, even at playing iconic American presidents? Because that&apos;s where the paycheques are. Watch our TV stars beat the path to Beverly Hills. Why do some of the most dynamic on- and offline newspapers cross the Atlantic at a bound, so that the correspondents they employ there hugely outnumber those they keep to report Britain outside the M25 \u2013 and even across the whole of Europe? Because size matters. It&apos;s where the future of scale and opportunity lies. The Daily Mail claims that it&apos;s Earth&apos;s most popular newspaper online, formidably revered in the US \u2013 and busy hiring new staff there. The Guardian has gone the same route with striking user success. Look at the latest digital circulation figures and you&apos;ll find that 81,201,000 of the Mail&apos;s record-busting 126,753,000 unique browsers in January came from outside the UK; the Guardian had 49,481,000 international uniques in its own 77,931,000 record. But there&apos;s also a gritty question lurking here. Does Fleet Street as a whole rarely stray north of Watford because nobody wants to read what happens in that non-metropolitan hinterland? Is Europe closed for reporting business because it&apos;s a collection of faraway lands of which (Bunga-Bunga Berlusconi apart) we choose to know little? I went to the first European Press Prize ceremony in Amsterdam last week. The winners: a formidable Danish investigation of espionage, a battling Greek columnist, a Ukrainian daily making repeated waves \u2013 and Paul Lewis of the Guardian for his massively orchestrated analysis of the British riots. Yet, in a way, the most significant thing was the cluster of brilliant entries \u2013 from 32 countries \u2013 that came so close to winning too. Take Miranda Patrucic in Sarajevo, masterminding the Project on Organised Crime and Corruption and tracing proxy companies and massive huge scams from Lithuania to New Zealand and back. Take the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network explaining, in forensic detail, just where and how to buy yourself EU citizenship. Take Lukas Hassig lifting the lid on Swiss banks and finding retired cops inside doing a dirty trade in secret information. Who pulled the tax rug from under Starbucks? Tom Bergin of Reuters. Who changed the whole course of the Breivik mass-slaughter trial in Norway? Torry Pedersen&apos;s VG newspaper, daring to publish confidential medical reports on Anders Breivik that gripped a traumatised nation. It wasn&apos;t a black tie event. Most of us didn&apos;t wear ties at all. But there was singular, unbuttoned emotion in the speeches and conversations that flowed \u2013 along with a sense of place and time and reality. The countries of this prize&apos;s Europe are a jigsaw of different tongues, histories and traditions. If this (as somebody hinted) one day turns out to be Europe&apos;s Pulitzers, we&apos;ll have mountains of understanding to climb. But be clear that there are already terrific stories \u2013 and scandals that touch us all \u2013 in a continent where media market forces have to struggle to survive.

But in Abu Dhabi, where the aviation industry has grown up almost as spectacularly as the skyscrapers on the shoreline, the sheikhs who bankrolled the towering investment do not doubt that the fruits will come. While London&apos;s great and good grapple with the question of airport expansion, the world beyond is changing, as those running Britain&apos;s biggest airport and airline know all too well \u2013 frequently expressing their frustration that rivals are &quot;eating our lunch&quot; and leapfrogging them to aviation&apos;s top spot. The announcements last week that Etihad Airways \u2013 based in Abu Dhabi \u2013 was splurging $70m (\u00a347m) to secure three Heathrow slots, while British Airways saw its profits wiped out and its parent company, IAG, record a near-\u20ac1bn (\u00a3863m) loss, will not have made them much happier. &quot;In aviation,&quot; says Jos Nuihuis, the boss of Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport, mischievously enjoying his role as the current chief beneficiary of Heathrow&apos;s inability to build another runway, &quot;you have to take the chance when it&apos;s your\u00a0turn.&quot; While the northern hemisphere and transatlantic traffic draws the money, Europe&apos;s five hubs can do battle. But the political geography is changing and the crossroads of the world look ever more likely to be located in the Middle East. Developments at the three expanding hubs in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates underline that shift. The UAE&apos;s biggest airline, Emirates, last month completed the opening of an entire 20-gate concourse at its Dubai airport base purely for its fleet of giant A380s, Airbus&apos;s flagship aircraft which typically carry 500-plus passengers. Etihad \u2013 which was established less than a decade ago \u2013 announced that passenger numbers had passed 10 million a year and it was turning increasing profits, as plans to double the airport capacity take shape. And in Qatar, the $15.5bn Hamad International airport opens next month with a 4,850m runway fit for fleets of A380s to take off in the desert heat. The ambition is immense, as is the speed and scale of the growth to date. Qatar&apos;s airport will be able to handle 28 million passengers a year on opening, but chief executive Akbar al-Baker is planning extensions for 50 million by 2020, when the state hosts the football World Cup. In the gleaming new headquarters of Etihad Airways in Abu Dhabi, the airline&apos;s chief executive, James Hogan, spells out a vision of being a &quot;truly global airline&quot;. Staff drawn from 125 countries come through the training facility on site, the graduating class photos spreading along the walls showing a multinational mix in each intake. With 70 planes, Etihad is the smallest of the Gulf airlines, and all three have orders that will more than double their existing fleets. &quot;With aircraft technology you can fly to all points in the world from the Gulf,&quot; Hogan says. &quot;We fly to 86 cities and connect well [at] Abu Dhabi, and Abu Dhabi itself as a destination is becoming more relevant.&quot; For many British passengers, long-haul to the south and east of the globe has meant going on the classic Kangaroo route to Australia via Asia. But the longer range of modern aircraft and the rise of the Gulf hubs has set a new course for the Gulf and south east Asia. Etihad&apos;s investment in, and partnership with, Virgin Australia is one way that the journey now bypasses Singapore and Heathrow too. More notably, at the end of this month Emirates will take over from the ousted British Airways in a partnership with Australian flag carrier Qantas. Qantas&apos;s UK general manager, Eric Jelinek, said it was an &quot;amicable divorce&quot; from Heathrow&apos;s largest carrier: &quot;BA understands our reasons and that things have changed.&quot; He doesn&apos;t extend the metaphor, but has the air of a man whose airline has found a younger, richer, more glamorous partner, really going places and unsullied by previous trysts. This is Emirates&apos; first alliance, and Qantas is clearly overjoyed to have been chosen. For its Australian passengers flying via Heathrow, it offered five European destinations, with two stops. Now it can sell 33 with just the one stop. Qantas has since reported a surge in ticket sales from Australia to Europe. The Gulf hubs are undoubtedly well-placed to update some long-established routes. As Hogan, a native Australian, puts it: &quot;It&apos;s the new Silk Road.&quot; But, he adds: &quot;What people forget is that India, Pakistan, Bangladesh are huge populations. And even in the Middle East: at a point, post-Arab spring, when the Middle East normalises, Iraq and Iran have huge numbers of young people who want to travel. &quot;If you think within three hours&apos; flying time we have India \u2013 for them this is a weekend destination, a short break destination, an educational or medical care destination. &quot;You want sun, beaches, restaurants, shopping, it&apos;s here all year round. The Gulf states, the subcontinent and the Middle East all see Abu Dhabi as a destination in its own right, as well as all the through traffic.&quot; If Dubai&apos;s tourist industry and hotel scene is well-established, Abu Dhabi has plans to make a different type of tourist sit up, with a new Louvre, Guggenheim and national museum in fantastical designs from the world&apos;s leading architects on a newly linked island on the city&apos;s edge. Such breathtaking, vaulting ambition typifies the Gulf but also leads many observers to question if these are Ozymandian dreams, unsustainable follies in the sand. Can the vast oil wells in the desert successfully nurture not just one but three burgeoning aviation hubs, two within an hour&apos;s drive of each other? John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant, believes so: &quot;Probably they can. If you look at where they&apos;re sitting and the aircraft they&apos;re operating, they can serve pretty much anywhere in the world. None of them are having any difficulty filling their planes.&quot; Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, predicts: &quot;They will grow very seriously and gain status as major global aviation hubs. They sit at the crossroads from Europe to the east and between Africa and Asia, which are young and vibrant markets.&quot; But the backing of their governments has, he says, been the driver that has capitalised on that geographical logic. Strickland points out that, while the political aspirations of the various emirates mean that all want their own flag carrier and hub, and are backing aviation to the hilt, all three airlines are believed to be heading for profitability (although the accounts are not all transparent). &quot;You&apos;re not talking about carriers which are bleeding as businesses or in terms of the profits.&quot; Etihad&apos;s own strategy of investing in partner airlines is questioned by some analysts \u2013 &quot;when you see them buying parts of Air Seychelles or Air Berlin you do wonder what they&apos;re doing,&quot; says one \u2013 but the depth of the airline&apos;s pockets is emphasised by moves to take a major stake in Indian airline Jet to secure its three Heathrow slots. &quot;Remember that the European flag carriers are retreating,&quot; Hogan says. &quot;You&apos;re not going to see them operating into Tripoli, Basra, Baghdad.&quot; Not to mention other destinations closer to home: &quot;We fly into Manchester. BA isn&apos;t flying out of Manchester.&quot; This, says Strickland, shows where Gulf airlines can directly compete with Heathrow right now. &quot;While we&apos;re agonising about runways in the south-east, they have no capacity constraint and can offer a very attractive proposition to travellers in the UK. If you&apos;re in Manchester or Newcastle you can bypass London altogether.&quot; Intriguingly, Heathrow boss Colin Matthews \u2013 who now counts Qatar&apos;s sovereign wealth fund as a major shareholder with a 20% stake and has Al-Baker on his board \u2013 has started to make a virtue of the growth of the Gulf hubs, as well as Istanbul. He twice suggested at a business event last week that projections of growing passenger demand in the UK might have to be downplayed as aviation&apos;s focus shifts, meaning that a third runway, rather than a new four-runway facility outside London, might be sufficient for future needs. Scant consolation, perhaps, for a struggling European aviation industry that could do without the competition \u2013 and unfair competition with subsidised fuel, some have complained, although Hogan says it is &quot;a myth&quot; that he has access to free kerosene or money. Strickland, though, suggests that the future is one where the Gulf players become ever more prominent, but also more integrated \u2013 and those that embrace them will do best. &quot;Capacity constraints here are going to help their growth, and some of the markets are ones that Europe cannot access. Traffic flows such as China to Africa or even Asia to Latin America are going to be the great growth of the 21st century.&quot; Instead, European long-haul airlines might, Strickland suggests, have to emulate a Ryanair-style model on a global basis. Passengers now are used to taking an Irish plane from Stockholm to Madrid. That possible evolution might mean BA flying passengers from Latin America to China via a future BA base \u2013 in Dubai. Meanwhile, Europe&apos;s aviation industry has to get used to the fact that the Gulf money it has seen splashed again last week has radically tilted aviation&apos;s playing field, even more than the sponsorship of Man City and Paris St Germain has skewed football. Even the analyst who questions Etihad&apos;s investment strategy, likening it to the ill-fated SwissAir that was dragged under by partner airlines, points to an essential difference: &quot;Switzerland has got a lot of chocolate.

Bar a last-minute collapse in easyJet&apos;s shares, the FTSE group will confirm on Wednesday the remarkable rise of the upstart airline from Luton that now operates more than 1,000 flights a day across 600 routes. The airline&apos;s share price has more than doubled in the last year to 1018p \u2013 valuing the company at more than \u00a34bn, not far off that of British Airways&apos; parent firm, International Airlines Group at \u00a34.4bn. EasyJet&apos;s chief executive, Carolyn McCall, who took over in July 2010, would bring to three the number of women at the helm of a FTSE 100\u00a0company. The airline&apos;s valuation has soared as traditional carriers have retrenched and cost-conscious business travellers have increasingly been filling its seats. Haji-Ioannou started painting the aviation world a garish orange 18 years ago by flying from Luton to Scotland with two Boeing 737-200s on a &quot;wet-lease&quot; \u2013 hired complete with air and ground crew. The airline took delivery of its first fully owned plane the following year and started international flights to Amsterdam. In 2000 it floated on the stock exchange. Significant milestones were the acquisitions of Go and then GB airways, greatly expanding easyJet&apos;s fleet and reach. Over the last decade it has opened bases in France, Germany, Spain and Italy, allied to its early Geneva base, capitalising on broader shifts in the airline industry and the problems besetting traditional carriers. Douglas McNeill, investment director at stockbrokers Charles Stanley, said: &quot;It doesn&apos;t have the inefficiencies of legacy carriers but now has the size to make economies of scale. Now it&apos;s not the upstart, it&apos;s the benchmark for others.&quot; Yet easyJet&apos;s growth has also been accompanied by denunciations of the board from its founder, now no longer in charge but the largest single shareholder with around 37% in his family&apos;s control. Some of Haji-Ioannou&apos;s harshest words have been reserved for the outgoing chairman, Michael Rake \u2013 particularly aircraft orders \u2013 and excessive boardroom pay. That culminated in a stormy 2012 annual meeting when he attempted to make the airline part of the &quot;shareholder spring&quot; by ousting Rake. For his part, Rake this year warned that elevation to the FTSE100 would mean shareholders should protect &quot;London&apos;s reputation, and the company&apos;s reputation&quot; by keeping dialogue constructive and private \u2013 a warning to which Haji-Ioannou responded he could &quot;go fish&quot;. But where the board and Haji-Ioannou were on Monday united was in expressing delight at the impending elevation. EasyJet director of communications, Paul Moore, said that while the airline had never targeted a FTSE 100 place, it would be pleased to join the list. &quot;The share price\u00a0reflects our successful strategy. We want to become Europe&apos;s preferred short-haul airline,&quot; he said. &quot;But it&apos;s not about size \u2013 it&apos;s about being the passenger&apos;s choice.&quot; While Moore says the airline still operates on a low-cost basis, minimising unnecessary overheads \u2013 the headquarters are still the distinctly unglamorous address of Hangar 89 in Luton &quot;and will be for some time to come&quot; \u2013 he believes consumers no longer have that label in mind. In terms of passenger numbers it is the largest airline in Britain and the fourth largest in Europe, just behind Ryanair. Moore added that only in Britain does consumer perception lump easyJet with Ryanair, and that the historic low-cost airline association is being gradually unpicked. Easyjet believes allocated seating, on every flight since November, has broadened its appeal, with the previous boarding scramble having put off many travellers. The airline continues to expand in Europe: in the next month it will start providing competition on Italy&apos;s major domestic Rome-Milan route, as well as starting flights from the UK to Moscow. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Haji-Ioannou said the Greek entrepreneur was delighted with the easyJet share price \u2013 which has doubled his \u00a32bn fortune \u2013 and particularly proud to have made the rare journey from startup to the FTSE 100 in under 20 years. He said that being an &quot;active investor&quot; had proved an ideal role for the founder, who was still concerned that the airline could be jeopardised with a large aircraft order. He said higher fares had been charged on fuller planes because routes had not been &quot;flooded with seats&quot; as a result of keeping aircraft capacity down, and that costs had been controlled. &quot;Those factors, all of which Stelios has been involved in, have clearly done wonders for easyJet&apos;s prospects. It&apos;s the fact that he&apos;s always on their case makes them a better board.&quot; High flyer Carolyn McCall would join Angela Ahrendts at fashion group Burberry and Alison Cooper of Imperial Tobacco as one of only three women running London&apos;s top 100 public companies if easyJet is promoted to the blue chip index on Wednesday. The number of female bosses has fallen after the departure of Dame Marjorie Scardino from Pearson and Cynthia Carroll from Anglo American. Scardino was the first woman FTSE 100 chief executive when she took charge at the Financial Times owner in 1997, but stepped down in October \u2013 followed days later by Carroll&apos;s resignation from the mining giant. McCall, the 51-year-old former chief executive of Guardian Media Group, has won plaudits since joining easyJet in July 2010 and is credited by many analysts with improved focus on customer service in a male-dominated industry. Douglas McNeill of Charles Stanley said: &quot;There was a turnaround in fortunes that can be dated to McCall&apos;s arrival. She inherited a business that had operational problems \u2013 deteriorating punctuality, declining customer satisfaction and staff morale \u2013 and has managed to restore order, with a hard-headed emphasis on return on capital, something the City has warmed to.&quot; The daughter of British expats in India, McCall rose through the ranks of the Guardian&apos;s commercial departments over 24 years, having briefly trained as a teacher beforehand. In that time she also had stints on the boards of Tesco and Lloyds Banking Group. Now McCall&apos;s bonuses taking took her pay to \u00a32m last year \u2013 and share options she can exercise in July could substantially increase her rewards this year.", "sentences": ["The airline took delivery of its first fully owned plane the following year and started international flights to Amsterdam."], "title": "Easyjet poised to fly into FTSE 100", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/04/easyjet-fly-ftse-100", "tags": ["easyJet", "Airline industry", "Business", "Shares", "Money", "Stock markets", "Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-03-06T00:36:00Z", "article": "&quot;Catching up on recent editions of the Knowledge, I spotted the archive comment about Milan being founded by the first English player to play outside the UK,&quot; beard-stroked Mark Goodge a couple of weeks ago. &quot;A quick skim of the relevant Wikipedia article confirmed this (not that I&apos;d doubt you, oh no), and also added the salient fact that the club continues to use the English spelling of the city (Milan rather than Milano) in honour of its origins.

Yokohama F-Marinos Marinos means &quot;sailors&quot; in Spanish. (The F stands for flugels, the German for wings, from when they merged with the other Yokohama based team.) Kawasaki Frontale Frontal in Italian Oita Trinita Trinita can be considered either a combination of the English word trinity and Oita, or the Italian word trinita. Nagoya Grampus Grampus being the Latin name of the Risso dolphin. Jubilo Iwata J\u00fabilo means joy in Portuguese. Urawa Red Diamonds Diamonds are the logo of Mitsubishi. Kashiwa Reysol The Sun Kings Sanfrecce Hiroshima Sanfrecce is a portmanteau of the Japanese numeral for three, San, and an Italian word frecce or arrows.

CHELSEA: HISTORY MAKERS? &quot;It dawned on me recently that if Chelsea were to go on and win the Europa League this year on 15 May that, for a period of 10 days, they would be the holders of both major European trophies (as well as being technically the holders of the Cup-Winners&apos; Cup),&quot; wonders Brian Quinn. &quot;Has there ever been another brief period like this when a team held two European honours simultaneously? Perhaps going back to when there were three distinct European competitions?&quot; Chelsea will indeed claim a unique honour if they triumph at the Amsterdam Arena in May. Only four sides have ever won different European competitions in consecutive years \u2013 Juventus, Milan, Porto and Liverpool - and in each instance the teams were deposed as holders of one trophy before getting their hands on the other. Milan won the much-missed Cup Winners&apos; Cup on 23 May 1968, but Slovan Bratislava were crowned the new champions on 21 May 1969, seven days before Milan hammered Ajax in the Bernab\u00e9u to win the 1969 European Cup. Similarly Juventus won the Cup Winners&apos; Cup on 16 May 1984, but Everton won that tournament almost exactly a year later on 15 May 1985, a fortnight before Juventus won the European Cup in a final overshadowed by the Heysel tragedy. Likewise, Porto fell a week short in 2002-03 and 2003-04 after winning the Uefa Cup then the Champions League under Jose Mourinho, as did Liverpool between their Uefa Cup and European Cup wins in 1975-76 and 1976-77. FROM BOARDROOM TO PENALTY BOX &quot;I read your story on the most likeable players, and the section on Juninho brought back fond memories,&quot; writes Archie Whirlwind. &quot;I looked the fellow up on Wikipedia, and read there that he ended his career as player-president of his youth club Ituano. I have never heard of anyone being player-president, player-chairman or holding similar posts in a club while playing on a professional level. Is this case unique?&quot; They don&apos;t exactly fit the bill, but two that instantly spring to mind are the larger-than-life figures of John Ryan and Zhu Jen. The Doncaster chairman Ryan became the oldest player to appear for a professional British club when he made a substitute appearance for Rovers in 2003. At the age of 52 years and 11 months Ryan made a brief cameo at Edgar Street as Rovers came from behind to beat Hereford 4-2. &quot;I came on when the ref put his board up for an extra three minutes of injury time,&quot; said Ryan. &quot;I didn&apos;t actually get a kick of the ball but I had a good run around.&quot; Also having a good run around was Zhu, owner of Shanghai Shenhua, who was in the starting XI when his side faced Liverpool in a friendly in 2007. He was substituted after five minutes. And the 45-year-old repeated the trick in May this year, this time lasting 45 minutes alongside a presumably nonplussed Nicolas Anelka in the Shenhua attack against Argentina CN Sports. &quot;He&apos;s played in games before to let us see his love for football,&quot; said the Shenhua manager Sergio Batista before the game. &quot;No matter if he appears on or off the pitch, I look forward to him standing shoulder to shoulder with us in battle.&quot; Any more for any more?

Less a tangible technology and more a reason to shout &quot;They&apos;re printing 3D guns now? Endtimes! ENDTIMES!&quot;, slap on some tin-foil and run for the nearest bunker. Yet there are people building businesses out of this, which although innovative, disruptive and all those other words you have to use in these cases, are also proper, down-to-earth businesses. MakieLab is one of them. Based in London, the company raised its first seed funding in August 2011 to work on prototype 3D-printed dolls \u2013\u00a0Makies \u2013 which customers would be able to design themselves on its website. That site launched in alpha in May 2012, the company raised $1.4m from early-stage investors in June that year, and now in March 2013 MakieLab has released an iPad app called Makies Doll Factory to help people make and order Makies from their tablet. &quot;We started with the question of whether virtual goods could produce physical goods,&quot; explains co-founder and CEO Alice Taylor. &quot;Would 3D printing mean we could make virtual crates and barrels into real crates and barrels? The short answer was yes, but nobody was going to buy a crate or a barrel\u2026&quot; Hence dolls, based on Taylor and her three co-founders&apos; love of online avatars, and also the fact that dolls were the biggest category in the toys market \u2013\u00a0and a blissful lack of awareness about how difficult they&apos;d be for a 3D-printing startup. &quot;An eminent industry figure said to me a year in &apos;You do realise that was the hardest choice to make, don&apos;t you?&apos;,&quot; laughs Taylor. &quot;YES I DO NOW, thank you very much. But we&apos;ve done it!&quot; Rooting for the underdog Not that MakieLab is a dolls company: Taylor says it&apos;s more of a software manufacturing platform that can output 3D-printed shapes, including dolls but in the future other kinds of products. &quot;The dolls are product number one, but we want to produce toys and games \u2013\u00a0or toy/game combos \u2013\u00a0that are really carefully targeted towards specific consumer groups,&quot; she says. &quot;Makies are for girls aged 8+, but our second product may be for boys. Not that girls won&apos;t want to play with it too, or boys with Makies.&quot; When MakieLab raised its $1.4m of early-stage funding, there was a notable outpouring of warmth from fellow startups. That&apos;s partly because the four co-founders were well-connected in the London startups scene and beyond, but Taylor thinks there were other reasons. &quot;I think part of it came from people seeing a company doing something frankly quite weird, new and very experimental, with two women and two men in the four founders, at a time when people tended to picture startups as being three skinny guys from Stanford,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;So it was partly people going &apos;Wow! Underdog, that&apos;s amazing&apos;, and partly seeing it as encouraging anyone else who&apos;s got interesting new ideas, sees those skinny Stanford boys and thinks &apos;I&apos;m never going to get into this startup scene&apos;. And of course, you can.&quot; Makies may have initially launched as a website, but mobile was in mind from the start. MakieLab used the Unity game engine to ensure its making tools would transfer elegantly to mobile devices \u2013\u00a0something that also means porting the new iPad app to Android will happen sooner rather than later. In the two days since the iPad app was released, people have made more than 4,500 Makies with it \u2013\u00a0created them in the app, if not actually paid for real versions. Taylor says that already, iPad users are more &quot;much more engaged&quot; than website visitors in their usage of the creation tools. Mobile game plans MakieLab is already working on a separate Makies-themed mobile game to be released this summer, which will be selling digital goods rather than physical dolls. Taylor says that the company is thinking hard about how this will work though, to ensure parents are comfortable with whatever in-app purchase model is used. &quot;The game will be similar to the app, in that you&apos;re creating characters in a maker-space, but that space will now expand a bit, and you&apos;ll be able to make things other than just the character. You&apos;ll be making clothes and accessories, and harvesting materials to make them,&quot; says Taylor. Something that I like about MakieLab both as a geek-journalist and a parent is the way it encompasses both digital and physical play: virtual and real dolls. This blending of digital and physical play seems like an important trend, especially if you watch how children seamlessly move between the two worlds given the chance. It&apos;s a view not shared by some commenters when I&apos;ve written about children&apos;s apps on this blog, who grouch that kids should be playing outside with physical toys, not using apps on touchscreens \u2013 as if this is an either/or choice. &quot;Exactly! It&apos;s not either/or: kids will do both,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;They&apos;ll play on-screen, then go outside and play with their friends, and often the screen will be in their pocket while they&apos;re playing with their friends, or their friends will be with them when they&apos;re playing on-screen. This is all just blended now.&quot; This debate was actually the spark that created MakieLab back in 2010, when Taylor was at a digital conference in New York that was co-located with a toy fair \u2013 with some crossover in delegates between the two. As one of the digital speakers was taking questions, someone from the toy industry asked &quot;All this screen business is all very well, but don&apos;t you want kids to go outside and play with a hoopla stick?&quot; As this question rattled around her head, Taylor wandered the toy fair, and realised how completely separate the toy and digital entertainment industries were. &quot;It was all plastic products made far away in China, completely separate from the content creation happening there in America,&quot; she says. &quot;It just felt so weird. How could we make it blend better?&quot;     The Makies Doll Factory app is available on iPad, with Android to follow    Digital loves physical This isn&apos;t to say people who work almost exclusively in digital entertainment don&apos;t love a good toy. In fact, something I&apos;ve noticed a lot is that people I met who spend their days subsumed in digital content often have sprawling vinyl, book or toy collections at home. Taylor has noticed it too. &quot;I think it&apos;s a symptom!&quot; she says, noting that people who are heavily involved in digital may have a heightened sense of how intangible it is. &quot;I started making websites in 1994, but now I basically can&apos;t see any of my work from then through to around 2003. It&apos;s been rewritten, archived or gone offline and disappeared,&quot; she says.  &quot;Digital people feel that in their bones: we know that if we don&apos;t take screenshots and make photographs of them to frame and hang on the wall, we can&apos;t guarantee anyone will see this in the future. And of course, we all love toys. Toys are amazing.&quot; Well, some toys. Another interesting thing about Makies and 3D-printed toys more generally is their removal of gender barriers. Boys can make girl dolls, girls can make boys, and (with apologies to Blur) they can come up with something they really love without worrying whether the box is pink or khaki. That&apos;s not quite the case in the traditional toy industry. Taylor laughs heartily while telling me about Hasbro&apos;s plan to make Nerf appeal to girls by making a pink crossbow called the Nerf Rebelle Heartbreaker, for example. &quot;It takes a brave parent to walk down the boys aisle in a shop to buy a giant gun for their daughter, or walk down the girls aisle to buy their son a doll. It basically doesn&apos;t happen. Your radical lefty Guardian reader, yes, but for the most part no,&quot; says Taylor, tongue firmly in cheek. &quot;We don&apos;t as a company believe that you should have to pinkify something to make it acceptable for girls, or khakify it for boys. We don&apos;t want to start saying &apos;You&apos;re a boy, you can&apos;t put a skirt on that doll&apos;. Whoever the kid is, they should be able to make boy and girl dolls.&quot; 3D-printing disruption MakieLab isn&apos;t just trying to disrupt the traditional toy industry on gender lines, of course. 3D printing itself could be seen as a big threat to those aisles full of toys, although also a big opportunity if their manufacturers embrace it. Has the toy industry been sniffing around MakieLab? &quot;Strangely, I don&apos;t know if they&apos;ve noticed us yet,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;They haven&apos;t been in touch. The games industry has, journalists, trade shows, museums and even a makeup company has been in touch, but no toy companies yet. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s on their radar, although of course it could be, and they might be plotting to kill us right now! We haven&apos;t heard from them.&quot; She goes on to stress that of course 3D printing is on the toy companies&apos; radar \u2013\u00a0for their own internal prototyping processes if nothing else \u2013\u00a0and predicts that in 5-10 years most manufacturers will be using it commercially. But there are barriers. &quot;The question is whether as businesses they are prepared yet to start to look at it for production. It&apos;s expensive compared to stuff made in China, and political too if you&apos;re a giant company who&apos;s been manufacturing out there for 15 years,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s where all your people, machines, systems and logistics are, and it&apos;s the world you understand. So when some upstart comes along and says you should be 3D-printing in London now\u2026 I suspect that is the barrier. There will be plenty of emerging-tech types in toy companies saying this is part of the future, but as a big company it takes a long time to change course.&quot; The local-manufacturing point is potentially important. MakieLab currently makes its dolls in London and Amsterdam, with ambitions to widen its manufacturing network as more 3D-printing facilities become available in the years ahead. That&apos;s why Makies are expensive compared to more-famous doll brands \u2013 they start at \u00a359.99 for a basic model, with the skin colours, clothing and accessories costing extra. Explaining the difference is a political discussion, by necessity. &quot;We like our cheap goods, yet at the same time, we have these cheap goods because there are people in China who&apos;ll work for 20 dollars a week,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;Everybody knows that is messed up, and it will change. The minimum wage went up 20% last year in China, and it will go up again.&quot; Distributed networks MakieLab&apos;s hope is that when the placement of 3D-printing facilities around the world is evenly distributed, production will be easier for the company and others like it. Taylor also makes an interesting parallel with this future manufacturing network: &quot;It&apos;ll make a distributed network of manufacturing machines, and that&apos;s how the internet started: it was a distributed network,&quot; she says. &quot;That&apos;s amazing, but we&apos;re not there yet with 3D printing.&quot; Hence the \u00a359.99 starting price for a Makie doll, which Taylor says leaves &quot;very small margins&quot; for MakieLab, although she hopes to improve them over time as the business scales up \u2013\u00a0ultimately bringing the price including extras under \u00a350, and ideally under \u00a340. &quot;It&apos;s an inevitability that prices will come down, but how fast? Nobody really knows,&quot; she says. &quot;That&apos;s very exciting, but that&apos;s also what keeps me up every night at 3am. I could do with slightly less excitement, thank you very much! But it is amazing being in this mix of industries, where every month there&apos;s a new development.&quot; Is 3D printing heading for a fall though? There&apos;s such a lot of hype and noise around it at the moment, and that whiff of science fiction \u2013\u00a0I write this as someone who loves the genre \u2013 that may be provoking an exaggerated backlash from sceptics, and inflated expectations from supporters. Taylor quotes Gartner&apos;s famous hype cycle theory for emerging technologies. &quot;3D printing is right at the top of the peak of inflated expectations, before the trough of disillusionment,&quot; she says. &quot;For some people, the trough will be &apos;Why can&apos;t I print my own kidneys?&apos;, and it&apos;s going to be a really big trough for people who are thinking that we&apos;re going to start 3D-printing houses on the moon next week. But for us, it will be something like &apos;Why isn&apos;t the price coming down as fast as we thought it would?&apos;. And then the price will come down.&quot;", "sentences": ["MakieLab currently makes its dolls in London and Amsterdam, with ambitions to widen its manufacturing network as more 3D-printing facilities become available in the years ahead."], "title": "MakieLab talks 3D-printed dolls, apps and blending digital and physical play", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/mar/06/makielab-3d-printing-dolls", "tags": ["3D printing", "Apps", "iPad", "Tablet computers", "Mobile phones", "Smartphones", "Toys", "Media", "Technology", "Technology startups"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-03-08T18:00:00Z", "article": "The track I&apos;ll be opening my next DJ set with Four Tet: For These Times   I opened my set in Rotterdam with this track and the crowd went bananas.

As part of his drive to get more people on bicycles and make the capital less intimidating for new and existing cyclists, he&apos;s promising lanes on landmark roads such as the Westway, a redesign of several notorious junctions and &quot;Quietways&quot; through residential areas.  It all sounds great and with luck will catch on across the country. Up above the city, cruising magnificently past Paddington and stationary cars, cycling could once more become a thing of joy. Commutes reduced from hours to minutes, generations of children pedalling to school unmown by rogue HGVs. As Johnson points out, what stops many people from cycling in London is fear. Entirely legitimate fear, since you can be quicker than Wiggo and lit like the Heathrow runway, but if you&apos;re not intimidated by playing in the traffic around Vauxhall Cross or Elephant and Castle, then there&apos;s something very wrong with your adrenals. At present, there are a small number of wonderful cycle routes joined together by a lot of very big city and however cleverly you dodge and weave through the backstreets, eventually everyone ends up being spat back on to the dual carriageways. If you&apos;re an experienced cyclist, that&apos;s fine. If you&apos;re not, then you ride scared, and if you ride scared then you&apos;re dangerous. Much of the surly bravado of London cyclists comes from exactly that \u2013 being scared, trying not to show it. Proportionately, the rate of serious cycling accidents is dropping every year, but somehow that doesn&apos;t feel like any consolation while you&apos;re waiting for a gap big enough to hurl yourself across four lanes at Hyde Park Corner. The bonus is that in central London, there are now so many cyclists that motorists have begun to expect them. The downside is that many of those motorists still don&apos;t like them much. Bicycles may have been invented long before SUVs, but in British transport terms they&apos;re considered latecomers. London will never properly compare with Amsterdam, not just because the Netherlands are flat and full of sensible people, but because the Dutch built their cycle lanes at the same time that they built their roads. Bicycles were treated as part of the system. But as Boris already knows, trying to retrofit cycling into an existing road plan is like trying to persuade the Thames to slide up through Highgate. Realistically, it&apos;s not possible to get all private cars off the roads or reach a state where buses and cycles aren&apos;t sharing the same space. It isn&apos;t possible to totally de-scarify cycling or, indeed, to turn the now semi-feral cyclists of London into regiments of helmet-wearing, law-observing drones. The best option is what Boris is trying to do: make cycling fun again. The Boris bikes are brilliant and they make people want to try them. The new cycle lanes might pull off the same trick. In the meantime, if you want to start cycling, don&apos;t spend the money on a fancy bike, spend it on two hours with someone who will teach you how to cycle in the city, not the way the government wants you to, but the way it should be done.

The company \u2013 owner of a diverse range of assets including the Lancet, the LexisNexis legal and professional information business, Comic-Con exhibition and more than 100 magazines such as Estates Gazette, Farmers Weekly and New Scientist \u2013 paid Engstrom \u00a32.28m in salary, benefits and bonus last year. The payout, which includes a bonus of \u00a31.15m, came on top of awarded shares to the value of twice his base salary, or about \u00a32.1m, as part of the firm&apos;s executive share option scheme. Mark Elliott, chairman of the remuneration committee, said that the 49-year-old had also been given a salary increase of 2.5% following the strong performance of the company in 2012. Engstrom&apos;s base salary was raised to \u00a31,076,891 from 1 January. &quot;This level of increase is in line with 2013 increases applicable to the wider employee population and other senior executives,&quot; said Elliott. The Swede, who has worked at Reed Elsevier since 2004, had accrued a \u00a32.7m pension pot by the end of last year. He also holds 107,040 shares in Reed Elsevier plc, the London-listed operation, which are worth about \u00a3793,000, and 509,556 in Reed Elsevier NV, which is listed in Amsterdam, which are worth about \u20ac6m (\u00a35.2m). Under the terms of his contract, Engstrom is required to hold shares in the company in a personal capacity worth at least three times his salary, or about \u00a33.15m. Reed Elsevier enjoyed a bumper year in 2012, beating analysts&apos; expectations with adjusted net profit of \u00a31.1bn. This was the best performance in the 20-year history of the combined Reed/Elsevier, with its London-listed share price recently hitting a historic high of almost 750p. Total revenues grew 2% to \u00a36.1bn as profits before tax rose 25% to \u00a31.18bn. The company has been steadily reducing its exposure to print magazines in recent years, which are housed in its Reed Business Information division. In October, it sold the US entertainment industry bible Variety for $25m (\u00a315.6m) to the parent company of Deadline.com, Penske Media Corporation. In January the company sold off RBI Australia and it is in the process of exiting the Spanish market. RBI&apos;s total revenues fell 5% to \u00a3663m. On an underlying basis, stripping out the effect of currency translation, plus acquisitions and disposals, revenue grew 2%. This was due to the data services businesses within RBI, such as the anti-money laundering operation BankersAccuity, which showed double-digit growth. Adjusted operating profit rose 8% \u2013 10% on an underlying basis \u2013 to \u00a3119m. Reed Elsevier said user and subscription revenues now accounted for 69% of RBI&apos;s total revenues, up from 62% in 2011. The remaining 31% comes from print and online advertising.

Without growth it will be difficult to reduce the deficit. However, infrastructure spending is crucial to rebalancing the economy towards the regions and Greater Manchester is well equipped to benefit from the process. It is time to drive regional recovery with a more cost-effective allocation of resources. This is why we&apos;ve produced the Budget for Greater Manchester. In the budget, we call for a \u00a320bn boost to infrastructure spending with \u00a35bn allocated to the North West and \u00a32.5bn to Greater Manchester. It is time to drive recovery up the M6 to other places as well as London and the South East and create the conditions to rebalance the economy. Boris Johnson has also pledged to invest more than \u00a3900m over the next decade in cycle schemes, including a 15-mile east-west route which the Mayor dubbed &apos;Crossrail&apos; for the bicycle. This will mean more will be spent on cycling in London over the next ten years than has been spent on all forms of transport in Greater Manchester over the last decade. It is time to put a stick in the London wheel and allocate more to the all the regions of Great Britain. The Budget for Manchester also calls for additional support for business and commercial real estate lending, with the creation of \u00a3100bn SME and CRE (commercial real estate) bonds. The bonds would offer low coupon five, 10 and 20 year money issued by UK banks, purchased by the Bank of England and guaranteed by HM Treasury. The bonds would be funded by QE gilt redemptions, dividend payments and a modification of the Funding for Lending scheme. This would resolve the issues of capital adequacy and the regulatory burden which inhibits lending by business banks to SMEs and the property sector. Investment in Greater Manchester offers value for money and high pay back ratios. The challenge to improve travel to work times and to extend the travel to work area continues, with the Northern Hub strategy and the Transport for Greater Manchester Plan. The proposition to allow local authority pension funds to invest 30% of funds into infrastructure and property is welcome. Additional tools exist to identify medium-term revenue streams to support such schemes, like business rates, new homes bonus, the community infrastructure levy, council tax and schemes including the enterprise zone at Airport City. These can contribute to the blend of funding projects need to make them viable. Transport and digital connectivity are also crucial elements for growth in Greater Manchester, with too little investment so far in most places. Where the new Metrolink lines have been installed through Tameside, Rochdale and Oldham, complementary planning and investment is needed to realise the potential the trams offer. Greater Manchester has the potential to become a centre of economic growth in the UK on a par with its comparator cities of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Lyons and Munich. To do this it needs more leverage over the investment made within the city, and for more of that to be spent to generate growth. Government could do more in terms of business rate retention and discretion, which could be used to further drive investment. The &apos;Earnback&apos; model, agreed in the &apos;city deal&apos; is a step in the right direction, as the government agreed in principle that up to \u00a31.2bn invested in infrastructure improvements will be paid back when economic growth is seen. These funds will be reinvested in further infrastructure improvements. Manchester has significant expertise in the key technologies that will deliver economic growth and jobs and we should capitalise on these to produce the next generation of industrial products across sectors such as electric cars, smart energy networks, mobile phones, medical devices and two-dimensional products led by the rapidly-developing science of graphene. Greater Manchester needs to capitalise better on the research excellence in its universities and the R&amp;D capabilities of its firms. The national allocation of funding for big science projects in the UK would help this. The government has largely protected the science budget, but should do more as part of a stimulus package. In Manchester this would mean support for the development of the soon-to-be vacated former UMIST campus and its transition into a world class innovation park adjacent to the planned HS2 terminus. The government should seek to consolidate existing private sector science investment in the regions. Government investment in housing has failed to keep pace with demand for decades. Now is an ideal time for the government to address this as part of a stimulus package to unlock large scale housing sites in areas like Manchester. The CBI has called for 50,000 new homes to be built in the UK economy. We argue for 50,000 to be built in Greater Manchester with a target of 10,000 in each of the next five years. Our aim is to provide an independent and credible assessment of the current state and forecast performance of the national economy and the implications of this for Greater Manchester. The Manchester Budget is intended to provide a robust basis for discussion with government on the role of our city in ensuring national prosperity.", "sentences": ["Greater Manchester has the potential to become a centre of economic growth in the UK on a par with its comparator cities of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Lyons and Munich."], "title": "It's time to drive recovery in all the UK.

He paints modern frescoes that transform interior spaces by literally opening up new perspectives. Using mathematically calculated techniques that go back to Italian Renaissance architects Filippo Brunelleschi and Leon Battista Alberti, he maps out abstract patterns that create vertiginous spatial illusions. Wright is an artist of visionary modernity and a painter steeped in the traditions of his craft. It is therefore hugely appropriate that Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum, one of the greatest galleries in the world that is shortly to reopen after a decade-long reconstruction, has chosen to celebrate its 21st-century renewal by commissioning a permanent work by one of the most exciting artists of our time. Wright has painted a vast network of black stars on a ceiling adjacent to the Rijksmuseum&apos;s most famous masterpiece, Rembrandt&apos;s The Night Watch. This international recognition for one of Britain&apos;s best artists will mean that his stellar art is forever linked with one of Europe&apos;s supreme paintings. I haven&apos;t seen it yet except in photographs, but the subtle allusions already resonate. Black stars? Why black stars? Perhaps because Rembrandt is a painter of the invisible; the dark depths and luminous glows that suffuse Rembrandt&apos;s paintings lead the mind&apos;s eye inward, to a place of mystery where the stars go out. Wright&apos;s black stars evoke, perhaps, Rembrandt&apos;s negative universe \u2013 his black matter of the soul. I was on the jury that awarded Richard Wright the 2009 Turner prize, so I take an interest in the lad. It&apos;s great to see this elusive artist \u2013 until recently all his works, including his gold leaf Turner mural, were deliberately destroyed after a few weeks \u2013 getting the international recognition he deserves. His award in 2009 was a win for real modern art, as opposed to celebrity posturing. It proved our era too can create beauty, as the Dutch did in the 17th-century paintings that are the jewels (or black stars) of the Rijksmuseum. That braid is not broken. Yet Wright is a deeply modern artist who works, as Robert Rauschenberg said artists should, in the space between art and life. The reason he destroys so many of his site-specific paintings is surely that he does not want to make art that imposes itself oppressively on the world. His works inhabit a space \u2013 as people do \u2013 and relate in a physical, intimate way to their viewers, making us aware of our being in the world, our bodies and imaginations. In fact, this too relates to Dutch 17th-century art. Paintings in the Rijksmuseum such as Vermeer&apos;s hypnotic The Little Street take direct pleasure in the facts of everyday life. Art for the Dutch always was a part of life \u2013 and Wright&apos;s radical vision is at home with their humble works of genius.", "sentences": ["It is therefore hugely appropriate that Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum, one of the greatest galleries in the world that is shortly to reopen after a decade-long reconstruction, has chosen to celebrate its 21st-century renewal by commissioning a permanent work by one of the most exciting artists of our time."], "title": "Richard Wright's stellar art shines next to Rembrandt at the Rijksmuseum", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/mar/14/richard-wright-stellar-art-rembrandt", "tags": ["Painting", "Art", "Art and design", "Installation", "Rembrandt", "Museums", "Culture", "Netherlands"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-03-15T12:09:29Z", "article": "Chelsea, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur all managed to avoid each other in the draw for the quarter-finals of the Europa League where they will meet Rubin Kazan, Benfica and Basel respectively.

Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s side will face a Russian side which has already knocked out two Spanish sides in Atletico Madrid, the Europa League holders, and Levante.

With no English club in the last eight of the Champions League for the first time in 17 years it is of course predictable \u2013 and let us also be fair \u2013 understandable that attention in English football should re-focus on Europe&apos;s secondary, and hitherto rather overlooked, disdained and generally trash-talked club competition. If only because it is here in the last eight of the Europa League that English football finds itself alternatively represented, with Chelsea (just), Tottenham Hotspur (just) and Newcastle United (also just) overcoming assorted middle-to-cruiserweight opposition this week to make it to the last eight. Plus of course, the draw has been kind. The three English clubs have duly avoided one another and will instead be hoicking their entirely incidental disproportionately massive TV advertising revenues around an assortment of European destinations 3,400 miles apart. And so here it is. Get ready for Europa fever as the English football media and, possibly even public, find the perfect moment to realise finally that the Champions League is an overblown cash-sozzled sell-out and that it is in the Europa \u2013 hem, hem \u2013 that we find true variety, not to mention the older virtues of team-building, fiscal parity and a sense of genuine competition. There is a powerful likelihood at least one English club will reach the final, to be played \u2013 with an appropriate edge of historical micro-chic \u2013 at the Amsterdam ArenA on 15 May. With this in mind it seems likely the next two months of midweek football will be sidetracked by the competing excitements of newbie Europa enthusiasm plus, at a lower pitch, a chorus of hipsterish dismay as the full-beam mainstream descends on a tournament that has carried a sense of being a niche pleasure for those who like their European football underexposed, anti-Redknapped and blessed with an almost nostalgic sense of hinterland. It is four years now since the Europa League was concocted as a mash-up of the Uefa and long since departed Cup Winners&apos; Cups, restyled as an aspirational mob-handed cut-and-paste Champions League-style product in its own right. As the competition has become established initial scepticism about its obvious commercial intent has given way, grudgingly, to an appreciation first of all of its enduring diversity: by way of example, this year&apos;s qualifying rounds featured Elfsborg of Sweden beating Floriana of Malta 12-0, this despite the presence in the Maltese club&apos;s goal of Tony Warner, formerly of Liverpool, Swindon Town, Celtic, Aberdeen, Millwall, Cardiff City, Fulham, Leeds, Norwich, Barnsley, Hull City, Leicester, Charlton, Scunthorpe and Tranmere. This, before the absolute triumph of TV-fed revenues, was in large part what European football was all about. In the competition proper the Europa League has also produced both high-quality football and alluring diversity in its late stages. Five Spanish winners in the past nine years is as powerful an indication of La Liga&apos;s generational strength as Barcelona&apos;s simultaneous domination of the Champions League. And yet this is still a competition that has allowed Fulham, Shakhtar Donetsk, Zenit St Petersburg, Middlesbrough (remember that?) and Braga to reach their first European finals. It is perhaps not unduly forward for supporters of Premier League teams to hope that the presence of three English representatives will bolster standards further. Not least because there appears to be genuine desire to actually win it. It is a mark of how far the Champions League has distorted the focus of Europe&apos;s elite clubs that it is necessary to record the fact that both Rafa Ben\u00edtez and, in particular, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas palpably want to win Europe&apos;s secondary cup competition, despite the distraction of ensuring entrance to next year&apos;s Champions League. If, for Ben\u00edtez, there is a sense of self-promotion in this, of a pruning of the personal CV, for Villas-Boas the Europa League remains the tournament in which, with Porto, he built his reputation, the means with which he escaped an immediate future of well-connected anonymity in Portugal, and a tournament that, beyond the itchy trigger-fingered hierarchies of the Premier League, presents him in his best light to the wider world. For Spurs too, there is a heartening sense of focus on progressing as far as possible towards winning the club&apos;s first European trophy since 1984. The calamitously shaky extra-time away-goal defeat of Internazionale on Thursday night will do little to promote Tottenham&apos;s ambitions of finishing fourth this season, just as it did little for Villas-Boas&apos;s own reputation: for an hour Spurs presented Inter&apos;s diamond midfield with the equivalent of a set of precise sign-posted directions \u2013 the high defensive line, the lack of midfield pressure \u2013 towards the 4-0 victory that would put them in the quarter-finals. But to his credit Villas-Boas reorganised frantically, if a little late, while his players looked spooked but never discouraged. Their manager even managed to dredge from a wilting team the attacking flurry in extra time that would eventually settle the tie. Similarly Chelsea and Newcastle, albeit aided by the prospect of little to play for elsewhere, are both committed to trying to win a competition that has been dismissed in the past by Premier League managers as costing more to compete in \u2013 no more stinging criticism than this \u2013 than it actually brings in revenue. With this in mind, if the Europa does have a distinct advantage over the Champions League it is in its rather old-fashioned air of uncertainty. Pretty much every team left has an equal chance of winning it, and this degree of sporting egalitarianism should not be taken for granted, speaking as it does to the central flaw in European football&apos;s current trajectory towards a dwindling oligarch of fiscally-driven elitism. It is this sense of managed corporate tedium \u2013 the pulling up of the rope ladder by those clubs at the very top of the revenue rankings \u2013 that presents the biggest threat not so much to the ongoing triumph of European football, but to its tonal depth, its level of interest, its basic sporting principles. Of course the Europa League will remain for many a stepping stone to other things \u2013 specifically to not being in the Europa League any more \u2013 not least among those left in the competition at this stage. But this is not to devalue it: football has always worked like this. Chelsea&apos;s opponents, Rubin Kazan of Russia, have played in the Champions League in the three seasons before this, while Fenerbahce versus Lazio is perhaps the tie of the round, even if a meeting of attacks boasting Dirk Kuyt and Louis Saha is perhaps unlikely to inspire chills as much as a sense of nostalgic oddity. So steel yourself. &quot;Thursday night, ITV4&quot; is no longer a crowd-borne insult. For the rest of the season it is likely to represent a subtle shift in the gravity of the domestic footballing week as English football&apos;s European fixation recalibrates itself around the secondary spoils. A little perspective never did anybody any harm and a minor humbling may even be the best thing that&apos;s happened to the Premier League in a while. Similarly the Europa League will be delighted with the enhanced coverage: with due apologies to the footballing left-fielder these are its most high-profile last-eight fixtures to date. Who knows, this could even be the start of a beautiful friendship.", "sentences": ["There is a powerful likelihood at least one English club will reach the final, to be played \u2013 with an appropriate edge of historical micro-chic \u2013 at the Amsterdam ArenA on 15 May."], "title": "Europa League steps into spotlight as English survivors target glory | Barney Ronay", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/mar/15/europa-league-english-tottenham-chelsea-newcastle", "tags": ["Europa League", "Chelsea", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Newcastle United", "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas", "Rafael Ben\u00edtez", "Football", "Sport", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-03-16T18:00:02Z", "article": "Peter Conrad, writer and critic  I cheered the other day when Antonio Pappano vented some of his frustration about the opera stars who torment him with their capricious cancellations and imaginary indispositions and changes of mind about what repertory they&apos;ll deign to perform. Without naming names, he accused them of being weak in body and in mind. &quot;More conceit than conscience&quot; would be my diagnosis. I agree with Pappano that it&apos;s a generational malady. I remember when great singers felt obliged to justify their reputations at every performance and made it a point of pride not to disappoint the customers, whether or not they had good reason. In 1974 Birgit Nilsson sang G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung at the Met with her arm in a sling and a dislocated shoulder after she&apos;d fallen into a hole on the stage. A few years later on New Year&apos;s Eve, unable to fly from Stockholm because of thick fog, she honoured a contract to appear as a guest in a gala at Covent Garden by taking a train to the south of Sweden, crossing to Denmark by ferry, and catching a plane from Copenhagen \u2013 a journey of about 12 hours, in order to sing for 10 minutes! What happened to that work ethic and that sense of responsibility? Christopher Gillett, opera singer and writer  I cannot agree that this is a &quot;generational malady&quot;. Contrary to popular myth, most opera singers are not petulant and capricious, but hard-working, diligent and serious about their craft. It strikes me as rather absurd, this notion that diva-esque behaviour is something novel, a symptom of a new generation when we all know the term &quot;diva&quot; has had a negative resonance for many, many decades. The difference is that in the old days it was easier to get away with it. It used to be common practice for singers to &quot;pull a sickie&quot; and not show up for rehearsals, when in fact they were perfectly healthy and doing a quick, well-paid Violetta in another country. These days, the internet won&apos;t let anyone get away with such tricks; a quick Google and they&apos;d be busted. But I&apos;m not here to defend bad behaviour. For every story you cite of the great old singers struggling to make it through shows, I can find you a modern singer rising to equal heights. Simon Keenlyside and Joyce DiDonato, to name two of the most famous, have carried on performing after breaking their ankles. I sang a show in Amsterdam the day my mother was found dead, floating in the Solent; there was no understudy who could replace me. There&apos;s nothing exceptional about that. Most of my colleagues would do the same. PC: It&apos;s not &quot;most opera singers&quot; we&apos;re talking about. The majority of your colleagues need the work; those who behave nonchalantly are the conspicuous ones, the high earners, and Pappano is indeed dealing with an entire generation of such flakes. He didn&apos;t name names, but everyone knows which vexatious individuals he was referring to. Some are chronic sufferers from diplomatic illnesses: they have an obliging quack in their entourages, and they never think of the audiences who have been disappointed and \u2013 because refunds are never given for cast changes \u2013 in a sense defrauded. Two broken ankles don&apos;t excuse so much unprofessionalism. Some of the malefactors are overgrown children, who need to understand that the love of the fans is not unconditional. There has been a change in the culture, which now markets these people as &quot;superstars&quot;, not working musicians. With their Rolex endorsements and their HD relays to cinemas and their promotional tours, they are branded goods sold around the world, and image matters more than actuality. The vital contact with the public is fraying, as is the sense of accountability to the music itself. It amounts really to a moral failure, as well as a failure of nerve. CG: Pappano said that singers seemed to be &quot;weak in their bodies&quot; and &quot;they don&apos;t care&quot; \u2013 a somewhat sweeping statement that was bound to raise a few hackles among the vast majority of professional singers. Singers face genuine vocal health issues and it would be sheer madness if they were to sing while ill. In the past it was simply not done to admit there was a problem. Diagnosis was also less reliable. These days it only seems sensible to follow the advice of an ENT specialist and have surgery, much in the same way a spin-bowler will have surgery to correct a damaged elbow. But that&apos;s not really the issue that bothers you. Yes, I agree that too much emphasis is placed upon superstardom, but is that the fault of the singers or of the public relations industry? Even, of opera houses themselves? There have been several major sea-changes that may explain why this appears to be a generational thing. First, very few houses now have a proper company of singers where a younger singer can work his way up through the ranks and learn his craft from his older colleagues, staying with a company long after he has established a career. The trend to director-led opera has often had casting directors hunting for people who look right rather than who sing well. While none of this excuses unprofessionalism, it has raised the stakes to a new level, and I think this needs to be said. PC: Operatic voices are fragile of course \u2013 just two bits of gristle in the throat, plus resonance where others keep their brains \u2013 but the mitigating plea about health is more complicated. Many singers who produce doctors&apos; notes get into trouble because they sing too much, or have eagerly offered to take on lucrative roles for which they don&apos;t have the physical means. So what lies behind the cancellations is a reckless, impatient ambition that is self-destructive. Why shift blame to the PR parasites? Singers don&apos;t have to submit to exploitation. Karita Mattila doesn&apos;t have a brand of perfume or a dessert named after her, or appear on talk shows, or sashay down red carpets; nor does she sing all that often, which is why she manages always to be superb. She, however, is the glorious exception. I can&apos;t imagine many of her contemporaries calling music a holy art, as the composer does in Ariadne auf Naxos. They are tempted to see it as a fast track to wealth and celebrity, and the falsity of their values is becoming clearer all the time, as our tinselly superstars crash back to Earth and burn out. I hope Pappano&apos;s brave, stern outburst makes a few of them think less about career and more about vocation. CG: Singers can&apos;t win. If they test their boundaries and fail, or worse still, do themselves damage, they are castigated for being reckless. If they stick with repertoire that they find comfortable, they are lazy and lack artistic ambition. From where I stand, Mattila is the rule rather than the exception, not in her abilities but in her commitment. Perhaps opera houses should admonish the errant stars. But they should also hold up their hands and admit that they not only fertilise the star system, they participate in the culture of ignoring contracts. My own example: a major opera company wanted me for a production when I was already contracted to another, smaller, house. Company A negotiated my release from Company B, without even consulting me. It was presented as a fait accompli. Perhaps opera houses need to ask themselves how much they are feeding the beast.", "sentences": ["I sang a show in Amsterdam the day my mother was found dead, floating in the Solent; there was no understudy who could replace me."], "title": "Debate: have modern opera singers got the wrong attitude?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/16/debate-opera-singers-wrong-attitude", "tags": ["Opera", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-03-17T00:06:26Z", "article": "Ten days ago the maestro-superstar Gustavo Dudamel was summoned back home to Venezuela to conduct the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra at the state funeral of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. He could hardly refuse: the president&apos;s office provides around half the funding for El Sistema, the country&apos;s high-profile education system with which Dudamel is indelibly associated. After zigzagging continents between Caracas and LA, he is now in London for a short residency at the Barbican with his Los Angeles Philharmonic, the elite orchestra of which he is music director. Never one to sleep, he has also found time to sprinkle musical gold dust over 100 young musicians from Tower Hamlets, Barking, Dagenham and beyond. Yet what had promised to be the big story of the season \u2013 Dudamel&apos;s mere presence \u2013 turned out to be quite another. Apologising for his quaint English, the 32-year-old ball of energy told us what we should really be celebrating: a mainstream concert hall, a large crowd and the music of three composers all alive and present! John Adams to conduct his own music, Joseph Pereira \u2013 the LA Phil&apos;s principal timpanist \u2013 as soloist in his\u00a0own Percussion Concerto, and Unsuk Chin, an elegant and discreet member of the audience for her new work Graffiti. To open the concert, Adams, a popular London presence who was also here for The Gospel According to the Other Mary (2012), danced his way through the lithe Son of Chamber Symphony (2007). Then it was Dudamel&apos;s turn. Reassuring us, as he adjusted his music stand, that his super-high podium was not evidence of his egomania but necessary\u00a0on account of his less than gigantic size, he led sober, illuminating performances of the\u00a0Pereira and the Chin, both European premieres. We&apos;ve seen plenty of the Dude in other guises: the showman mambo-ing in Venezuelan colours with his young Bol\u00edvars, or wringing every last drop of emotion out of Mahler (a new CD of the Ninth Symphony is just out). To encounter Dudamel now as fierce champion of today&apos;s music was a revelation. The Pereira concerto, full of aural strangeness and passing adventure, made joy out of textural contrasts. The composer-soloist switched from drums to marimba to vibraphone with persuasive ease, winning alert support from his fellow LA players. Unsuk Chin&apos;s multilayered Graffiti, a weightier piece, celebrated the idea of street art, from primitive to refined, labyrinthine to stark. Dense, skittering strings in the first movement, cascades of tubular bells and gongs in the second and urgent brass chords in the final &quot;passacaglia&quot; created a work of singularity and authority. Hers is a rare voice which commands your attention. At the end the audience wanted to cheer the charismatic conductor they had welcomed so warmly at the start. But again and again, as he had all evening, Dudamel ushered his composers to the fore and stepped away from the limelight. All told, these are astonishing times for the new. &quot;A hot story within a cool frame&quot; is the librettist Martin Crimp&apos;s pithy but accurate assessment of George Benjamin&apos;s sell-out Written on Skin, which received its UK premiere at Covent Garden last week in a production by Katie Mitchell conducted by the composer. Imagine jealousy, sex and a feast of human viscera \u2013 as in (actually) eat your heart out \u2013 handled with the ornamental perfection of an illuminated miniature and you get the idea. This pan-European commission, shared with Aix-en-Provence, Amsterdam, Toulouse and Florence, was first seen in Aix last July. It has been hailed a masterpiece. Benjamin also collaborated with Crimp in his only other opera, the short chamber piece Into the Little Hill (2006), based on the Pied Piper of Hamelin tale. The new work, 95 minutes long and with no interval, revisits another violent legend, an Occitan ballad from the 13th century whose subtitle could be: women, beware artists. Men, notably bragging husbands, might be cautioned to take care, too. A rich landowner, the Protector (Christopher Purves), commissions a younger artist, the Boy (Bejun Mehta), to portray his life and wealth and that of his youthful wife, Agn\u00e8s (Barbara Hannigan) in a vellum manuscript. The Boy elaborates their destinies in his own way. He and Agn\u00e8s fall in love, with fateful and monstrous consequences. In his first utterance the Protector, performed with brilliance and subtlety by the formidable Purves, sings of his possessions: the fields, the vines, the night stars, the pink eglantine, the obedient body of his wife. We know this kind of man, having met him in the castle of Bart\u00f3k&apos;s Duke Bluebeard. Here, however, his boasts and bullyings are confined, sieved and purified into music of exquisite detail.     \u2018Impeccable\u2019: Barbara Hannigan and Christopher Purves in Written on Skin at the Royal Opera House. Photograph: Tristram Kenton    Even as a child, Benjamin had a love of the meticulous, which he has attributed to his parents, who shared that trait. Precision was the vital essence of Ringed By the Flat Horizon, written when Benjamin was 19 and premiered at the BBC Proms in 1980 when he was still a student. It gives his music a gleam and, in workings but not sound, a mechanical dazzle which never falters. It also tends to keep the listener at arm&apos;s length. The mood of alienation is underlined by Crimp&apos;s excessive use of the third person. But the text is otherwise sturdy, poetic and easy to hear. Three sections, subdivided into scenes, each characterised by specific musical features, provide the work with a clear structure. Voices are given prominence, orchestration restrained except in pivotal instrumental outbursts. The duets between Mehta&apos;s countertenor and Hannigan&apos;s soprano, each of them agile, expressive and flexible, had ethereal lightness. Benjamin wrote the roles for this impeccable cast. Orchestral timbres are sensuous and minutely shaded, from the smoky drifts of woodwind at the end of Part One, to the glacial weight of the Protector&apos;s anger \u2013 blurts of low brass \u2013 in Part Three. Tiny atomic beads of harmony or timbre bump against each other but remain discrete, never melding into a wash of sound. Benjamin has used viols and mandolin in previous works but never, as far as I know, the eerie yawl of a glass harmonica. Mitchell&apos;s over-fussy production, stylishly designed by Vicki Mortimer and lit by Jon Clark, takes place chiefly in a medieval room. The rest of the action, featuring some black-suited angels including Mehta and a superb Allan Clayton, is set in a modern laboratory-cum-archive-cum-dressing room. Watching the opera twice (first and second nights) from different parts of the auditorium, I found my attention always fell on the &quot;past&quot;, with the &quot;present&quot; making little impact \u2013 except when Agn\u00e8s exits up an elegant, minimal staircase followed by angels in slow motion while the music gutters and sputters to a finish. If Mehta, the Boy/Angel, is the artist, we see nothing of his work. Any writing &quot;on skin&quot; is done through erotic encounters in this strange love triangle, or through the exacting stylus of George Benjamin himself. Given his operatic form so far, this composer&apos;s ideas grow larger and more intriguing with each endeavour. Can he now burst outside this &quot;cool frame&quot; and overwhelm us, as well as beguile?", "sentences": ["This pan-European commission, shared with Aix-en-Provence, Amsterdam, Toulouse and Florence, was first seen in Aix last July."], "title": "Los Angeles Philharmonic/Dudamel; Written on Skin \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/17/dudamel-la-philharmonic-written-skin", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Gustavo Dudamel", "George Benjamin", "John Adams", "Royal Opera House", "Martin Crimp"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-03-17T21:00:01Z", "article": "Chancellors of the exchequer have never been entirely straight about their tinkering with the tax system. With his penchant for &quot;stealth taxes&quot;, Gordon Brown certainly didn&apos;t always come clean with the British public. But when it comes to the vexed subject of tax avoidance, his successor George Osborne has taken the deception to a new level and, after three years, pulled off a stunning confidence trick. &quot;The parties agree that tackling tax avoidance is essential for the new government, and that all efforts will be made to do so,&quot; declared the coalition agreement in May 2010. The commitment was a victory for the Lib Dems and\u00a0for their pre-election shadow chancellor Vince Cable in particular. A\u00a0year earlier, Cable had responded to the Guardian&apos;s Tax Gap series by writing: &quot;Systematic tax avoidance by rich individuals and UK-based companies strikes a particularly ugly note in\u00a0these\u00a0straitened times.&quot; Cable&apos;s prize was to be a &quot;general anti-avoidance rule&quot;, and soon enough one of Britain&apos;s leading tax QCs, Graham Aaronson, was dispatched to work up the scheme that Osborne has promised to introduce in this week&apos;s budget. But it will be what Aaronson describes as &quot;narrowly focused&quot;, and apply only to the &quot;most egregious tax avoidance schemes&quot;. For which, read convoluted arrangements involving multiple transactions that circumvent the spirit of the law \u2013 of the sort deployed by comedian Jimmy Carr before he saw the\u00a0light (or the headlights of career death hurtling towards him). Scheming of this type is, however, a relative minority sport, and is generally defeated by judges increasingly intolerant of tax avoidance anyway. Worse still, the senior tax inspectors&apos; union argues that, by hitting just &quot;egregious&quot; cases, the new law risks &quot;actually facilitating avoidance&quot;. By far the costliest tax avoidance takes the form of the corporate structuring that has repeatedly hit the front pages in the last couple of years, whether through Starbucks&apos; payment of royalties to Amsterdam, Amazon&apos;s Luxembourg sales hub or Vodafone&apos;s multibillion-pound internal financing arrangements through the same grand duchy. And, as the Lords economic affairs committee pointed out last week: &quot;There is a misconception that Gaar [general anti-abuse rules] will mean the likes of Starbucks and Amazon will be slapped with massive tax bills. This is wrong, and the government need to explain that to the public.&quot; Such corporate manouevrings do not officially constitute tax avoidance even if, on any commonsense view, that is exactly what they are. When a couple of years ago the BBC commissioned a ComRes survey on attitudes to tax avoidance, it defined the practice as &quot;where people or businesses arrange their financial affairs to minimise the amount of tax they pay while remaining within the law&quot;. Eighty four percent of people favoured a clampdown on the behaviour, which clearly encompasses multinational&apos;s offshore structures. Yet this is where the great tax trick is played. Outside the official definition of tax avoidance, the offshore schemes of Britain&apos;s biggest multinationals have not just escaped any clampdown, they have been rewarded with a rewriting of corporate tax law that makes them more irresistible than ever. Working closely with the companies most affected, in his\u00a0last two budgets Osborne has relaxed \u2013 almost to the point of obsolescence \u2013 the\u00a0so-called controlled foreign companies laws that were introduced by Nigel Lawson in the early 1980s to prevent companies shifting profits into their tax-haven subsidiaries. From this year offshore financing structures such as Vodafone&apos;s, for instance, will be taxed at no more than 5%, while companies&apos; tax-haven branches will be exempt from tax. Incredibly, the British government is subsidising the largest companies to send billions of pounds into the world&apos;s tax havens. And in the absence\u00a0of any opposition from the Labour party \u2013 compromised by its own record of offshore tax relaxations and now advised by Vodafone&apos;s tax consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers \u2013 the new laws have arrived on the statute book\u00a0unchallenged. The big four accountancy and tax consulting firms that were hauled before Margaret Hodge&apos;s public accounts committee a few weeks ago are probably licking their lips. KPMG touts for business in one of its pamphlets by pointing out: &quot;For\u00a0every \u00a31m of finance income received in the UK, the finance company regime could save cash tax of \u00a3165,000.&quot; And even better: &quot;As the new rules have been designed and enacted by the\u00a0government, this should represent a\u00a0low-risk tax-saving opportunity.&quot; What\u00a0could be sweeter than state-endorsed tax avoidance? This surreptitious slashing of corporate tax bills is not something the government is keen to dwell on. Indeed, the rhetoric can be very different. In Davos, David Cameron said that businesses are &quot;setting up ever more complex tax arrangements abroad to squeeze their tax bills right down ... Well, they need to wake up and smell the coffee&quot;. Given low corporate tax rates, soon to be 21% and by far the lowest among G8 countries, the PM insists they &quot;should pay that rate of tax rather than avoid it&quot;. But Osborne&apos;s new rules \u2013 as KPMG\u00a0makes clear \u2013 give &quot;UK based multinationals an opportunity to significantly reduce their tax rate&quot;. In\u00a0other words, using &quot;tax arrangements\u00a0abroad&quot; the largest multinationals won&apos;t\u00a0pay even the new all-time-low headline tax rates. Through the &quot;general anti-avoidance rule&quot; and a regular stream of smaller specific anti-avoidance announcements, such as this weekend&apos;s move against a national insurance dodge, Osborne will sustain the illusion that tax avoidance is being fought on all fronts, confident that his bamboozled audience will never\u00a0notice the abject surrender on the\u00a0most important one of all.

In Yemen and across the Horn of Africa, khat is an integral part of the local culture. But in France the stimulant is a prohibited drug. According to figures released by the French Customs, seizures of khat leaves are soaring, up from 1.8 tonnes in 2011 to 4.5 tonnes in 2012, putting it on a par with cocaine (4.6 tonnes) but still far behind cannabis (24 tonnes). This February alone one tonne was seized. But the rising interception rate does not necessarily mean consumption in France is increasing. Half of last month&apos;s haul was found in the freight zone of Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport. &quot;France is a transit country,&quot; says S\u00e9bastien Tiran, general-secretary at the CDG Customs headquarters. &quot;Last year most of the consignments we seized were on their way to the United States or Canada.&quot; The increase in air-freight traffic may explain the higher interception rate. The recent reorganisation of air-freight services between East Africa and North America may also have played a part. A person sending a parcel to Canada, for instance, has no idea which route it will take. If it stops over in London, where khat is legal, it has a good chance of carrying on to Toronto or Montreal. A change of planes in Paris may lead to interception. &quot;Consignments are destroyed but we may pass on the details to [the authorities in] the destination country,&quot; Tiran adds. &quot;Khat is always sent by express freight, to save time on transport.&quot; The leaves, which taste a bit like dandelion greens, lose their effect a few days after being harvested. So smuggling khat is a race against time. Khat planes leave Africa in the evening, landing in Europe the next morning. Until January consignments of khat could be sent via the Netherlands. Deliveries could be collected by car and then distributed. &quot;We stopped a pair arriving from Amsterdam with 280kg in their boot,&quot; says Beno\u00eet Pascal, the head of the Customs service in Metz, in eastern France. &quot;They were heading for Switzerland, home to a large Ethiopian community.&quot; But some khat is destined for consumption in France. &quot;You find two types of leaf in France,&quot; says one Somali user. &quot;Mirra, which is grown in Kenya, is more powerful but not as nice as hereri, which comes from the Harar region of Ethiopia. Kenyan leaves keep up to five days, compared with only three for the Ethiopian variety. Some say Kenyans farmers use ox-blood as a fertiliser [...] To keep them moist the leaves are transported wrapped in banana skins.&quot; The Netherlands made khat illegal this year. Now the only reliable route is via London. There is a large Somali community in the UK and in 2011 almost 3,000 tonnes of khat landed there. To judge by recent seizures, khat is now crossing the Channel. Last month, officers found 860kg in a truck at Calais, which had just arrived from Dover. Four days later customs officers netted their biggest ever haul (1,017 kg) in a UK-registered van. The Netherlands ban has driven prices in Paris sharply upwards. A bunch of mirra leaves (about 100g) sold for \u20ac10 ($13) at the end of 2012. It is now worth \u20ac15, and hereri khat is almost twice the price. &quot;Prices and the risks involved have increased, but there are still two consignments a week arriving in Paris,&quot; says our Somali source. &quot;A few phone calls are enough to stay up-to-date. Then we meet at someone&apos;s flat and chew happily late into the night. We can talk freely and it reminds us of home.&quot; According to various manuscripts khat has been consumed in the Horn of Africa since the 14th century. Users tend to gather in people&apos;s homes in the early afternoon heat. The greener the leaves the juicier they are likely to be. After chewing them for about a quarter of an hour they form a sort of cud. As the juice causes a dry mouth, tea and soft drinks are generally served. Khat relaxes the body while stimulating the brain, inducing excitement and even euphoria. In Ethiopia khat accounts for 15% of all exports. Intensive farming of the bushes, which has driven out other crops, may have developed because they are relatively drought-resistant, require little attention and secure a steady income. The molecular structure of khat is similar to that of amphetamine and it can be highly addictive. &quot;Its psychoactive substances include cathinone, found in some designer drugs,&quot; says Julie-Emilie Ad\u00e8s, at France&apos;s Drugs and Addiction Observatory. In parts of Africa widespread consumption has a noticeable effect on the economy. &quot;It could take as much as 20 years to rid the Horn of Africa of khat,&quot; a European diplomat suggests. &quot;Everyone, from ordinary working people up to the top elite, chews khat. But leaving it freely available is also a way of keeping things peaceful.&quot; \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde", "sentences": ["&quot;We stopped a pair arriving from Amsterdam with 280kg in their boot,&quot; says Beno\u00eet Pascal, the head of the Customs service in Metz, in eastern France."], "title": "France catches up with khat users", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/19/chewing-khat-leaf-france-drugs", "tags": ["Drugs", "Society", "France", "Europe", "World news", "Khat"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-03-20T16:10:01Z", "article": "Now that Pope Benedict has stepped down, does he remain infallible? If so, how might that conflict with the infallibility of the next incumbent? The pope is infallible when, as head of the bishops of the church, he requires the faithful to believe a matter pertaining to faith or morals. This is the standard definition of infallibility. It goes no further. Should the pope stick his head out of doors and remark that it will be a nice day, he is just as liable to be snowed on as the next man. In practice, this means that the church debates a subject at great length and when the bishops and laity are in agreement, the pope makes an infallible pronouncement. The bishops&apos; discussions before the announcement can take a long time; the doctrine of the immaculate conception was in debate for at least 1,300 years before being made official. The pope, then, is analogous to the head of any company; he will say what his board of directors tells him. In the case of Emeritus Pope Benedict, the exercise of infallibility will not be required, since he is no longer in charge. Pope Francis is unlikely to have to be called upon, because there is nothing significant in the pipeline, as far as I know. Any other pronouncements the pope may make will be to do with organisational matters such as married priests, contraception and the like, which are liable to change because they are man-made rules promulgated in the best knowledge of their time. He will not be infallible when he makes such pronouncements, so just think of the pope as Mr Chairman and relax.

If I nip smartly across to that rock over there, that sabre-toothed tiger probably won&apos;t notice me \u2013 that doesn&apos;t need words, just the ability to imagine a 3D scenario. That cave is probably warmer than that one \u2013 we can recognise a category of things seen, like a cave, or a concept like warm, without needing words or pictures. When we rack our brains to remember a word, we are thinking largely wordlessly, until the word appears. As a kind of mathematician, the assumption that thinking requires words annoys me. Mathematical thought doesn&apos;t use words or even symbols in many cases. It&apos;s more like a brass rubbing: a pattern that becomes clearer as you repeatedly direct attention to different parts of it. Where communication, hence words, become essential is when we want to put thoughts into a shareable, eventually recordable form, without which complex ideas cannot evolve over\u00a0time. Roger Haines, London W5   It&apos;s said the sandwich was invented by the 4th Earl of Sandwich. What would he have put in it? The earl was about 1600 years too late to claim to be the inventor of the sandwich: &quot;This is what [Rabbi] Hillel would do when the the Temple stood. He would make a sandwich of matzah [unleavened bread] and bitter herbs and eat them together.&quot; (Quotation from the Haggadah, the prayer book for the eve of passover.) Perhaps we should call them hillels rather than sandwiches \u2013 though I can&apos;t imagine that bitter herb hillels would be all that popular at Pret.

The world&apos;s population is urbanising and expanding faster than ever. By 2050, well over half the planet&apos;s estimated nine billion people will be living in cities. If we don&apos;t &quot;smarten&quot; up our urban infrastructure, daily life could slowly ground to a halt. So what can be done to encourage &quot;smart city&quot; developments? That question was at the centre of a live Q&amp;A session, which was recently hosted online by the Guardian, in association with Barclays, Bird &amp; Bird and Cisco. Questions posted online and on Twitter were answered by a panel of six subject experts: Ronald Hendrikx, partner at law firm Bird &amp; Bird; John Jones, from Barclays Specialist Finance team; Gareth Macnaughton, director of Innovation &amp; Strategy Government at Cisco Systems; Usman Haque, director at Haque Design + Research; Peter Head, executive chair of the Ecological Sequestration Trust and chairman of the Institute for Sustainability; and Richard Miller, head of sustainability for the Technology Strategy Board. To kickstart the debate, a participant posting on Twitter asked for a definition of smart cities. Peter Head suggested that smartness lies in tools for making good decisions, not necessarily in smart technology itself. Usman Haque was also cautious about attributing too much value to physical infrastructure. &quot;I believe smartness arises in expanded human interactions and creativity&quot;, he argued. So for him it&apos;s more about &quot;smart citizens&quot;, than smart cities. The Q&amp;A session then considered why many urban planners look at the cost of investing in the latest technology and balk, and Gareth Macnaughton argued that a change of focus is needed. Forget mega-projects, he suggested. &quot;Smaller agile partners need to be able to deliver the &apos;smarts&apos;.&quot; It&apos;s important to stay realistic, added Miller. No city is going to back an unproven SME or start-up; instead &quot;imaginative integrators&quot; are needed. That is, organisations and individuals that can make the links between small innovative players. There are other clinchers to encourage smart city developments too, the Q&amp;A was told. One is to crystallise the advantages up front. &quot;It is hard to bring new ideas unless you can show their benefits in advance,&quot; said Head. He proposed that independent &quot;resource and economic modelling&quot; could be the best means of building an &quot;evidenced-based&quot; case. Another compelling driver is leadership, &quot;plain and simple&quot;, said Macnaughton. &quot;We have technologies and innovative new building methods but often we lack the leadership to be able to bring together different management lines, budgets and concerns and enforce co-operation.&quot; The debate then turned to the question of &quot;who will pay for all this?&quot; Miller, noted that most city governments &quot;are desperate to invest&quot; but simply don&apos;t have the money. So the question passes to the financial community. What are investors looking for? He saw glimmers of hope in &quot;impact investment&quot;; namely, where risk is divided up between the pubic sector (which takes the higher risk parts) and the financial sector (which takes more conventional level risk). John Jones from Barclays felt that &quot;appropriate allocation&quot; of risk made plenty of sense. &quot;Parcelling&quot; projects up to spread the total capital expenditure is another potential solution too. And Ronald Hendrikx pointed to further alternatives. Community infrastructure levies and &quot;tax increment financing&quot; for businesses were two ideas high on his list. Tweaking established funding tools marked another option. As a case in point, he cited the use of forfeiting in energy service company projects. The need to involve citizens was a recurring theme of the Q&amp;A session. Residents&apos; needs should be the starting point for smart cities. Macnaughton anticipated a revamping of the &quot;active citizen&quot; community, with local residents increasingly interacting and co-operating thanks to internet-based media. Haque highlighted the example of the city of Boston in the US, which launched a smartphone app enabling citizens to file city complaints publicly. &quot;They found that citizens themselves started getting involved with fixing things that fellow citizens complained about,&quot; he noted. He also cited dontflush.me, a citizen-designed web tool to advise New York residents about overflowing sewers. &quot;The real innovation \u2013 the reinvention of what city-making can be \u2013 is found in the entrepreneurial and creative actions of citizens, not necessarily big businesses, real estate companies or the omniscience of city planning,&quot; he observed. How to get consumers to change their behaviours is a related issue that exercised the panel&apos;s imagination as well. Miller proposed energy use as a &quot;good area&quot; in which to start. For Peter Head, it all came down to transparency of information. &quot;If you publish average consumption data for different types of property, then people try to beat the average,&quot; he stated. The same goes for water and waste: we all like to outdo the average. In this sense, the fact that smart meters are soon to be rolled out across UK households promises to be a positive measure. Finally, a poster on Twitter asked the panellists which city is a benchmark for &quot;smartness&quot;. While not everyone on the panel wished to be drawn on the question of which are today&apos;s smart city leaders, Amsterdam got Macnaughton&apos; vote and Head went for Copenhagen. Depending on the criteria, Miller picked out San Francisco, Singapore, Santander and Barcelona. &quot;They each offer something special, but no one I have yet seen has the full picture,&quot; he concluded. Cities must learn from one another, the panellists agreed, something that is beginning to happen through smart city associations such as C40 and Living-Labs Global, organisations which aim to promote and share smart city best practice. Miller concluded by mentioning the Technology Strategy Board&apos;s Future Cities Special Interest Group programme, in which 30 UK cities were asked to detail changes that they would make to meet tomorrow&apos;s challenges. The findings show that there is no single answer, he noted: &quot;The amazing thing is that there is such a diversity of challenge, ambition and proposed solution[s].&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Sustainable Business in association with Bird &amp; Bird, Cisco and Barclays.

Here is the artist himself, naked, looming in the dark, wrestling with another man. Now we see him as a blob on a hotel bed. Then a house falls around him and he stands blinking in the dust. Rolling a metal drum round the streets of Manhattan, you can catch a glimpse of him in shop windows as he passes. Now invisible, he thrashes through the undergrowth in an Amsterdam park at night. &quot;Sometimes I want to do things that I shouldn&apos;t, and I do them,&quot; Steve McQueen recently told me. Our conversation appears in the catalogue to his mid-career survey show at the Schaulager in Basel, Switzerland, which opened last weekend, a much-enlarged version of an exhibition that began last autumn at the Art Institute of Chicago, and which will not be travelling to Britain. Seeing so much of the British artist&apos;s work together \u2013 more than 20 film installations, as well as other works \u2013 is both daunting and immensely rewarding. In conversation, McQueen has the unnerving capacity to cut through the bullshit, recontextualising his work as he goes, and seeing it in new ways. He is a very reactive artist. Rather than having long-term strategies or a fixed sense of how to work or what to do next, his art is borne of reactions; specific situations tell him what to do and how to work. Turner prize winner, war artist and director of the prize-winning films Hunger and Shame, McQueen is currently in the final stages of a big-budget Hollywood movie, Twelve Years a Slave, starring Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender and Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis. Looking at his work is a complex business.     Deadpan: McQueen's 1997 video depicts a house falling down around him. Photograph: Marian Goodman Gallery and Thomas Dane Gallery    The Schaulager exhibition fills two floors of a building designed by Basel architects Herzog &amp; De Meuron with what the organisers describe as a &quot;city of cinemas&quot;. But this is no multiplex; it is a space of confrontations. The noise of a helicopter fills the first room. Its juddering din stops you in your tracks, an almost physical assault that crowds out thought. The helicopter is an eye, rising and turning about the Statue of Liberty. You can see tiny people staring out from the arches in the crown on the statue&apos;s head. The noise dies away, and I have the sudden illusion that the focus is clearer, the statue more present in the silence. McQueen never lets you forget that you are a body in space, too. Static, projected on a double-sided screen, has a room of its own. But as the camera circumnavigates the statue, we see other things turning on the other side of some glass doors in the next gallery. For McQueen, film is about more than the visible. Is this the reason he filmed Charlotte Rampling&apos;s eye, in close-up, his finger prodding around it with a delicacy that&apos;s almost shockingly intrusive? There are moments throughout that hinge on violence and intimacy, brutality and tenderness, bare animal facts. Often, there is a sense of disclosure \u2013 and you never forget that you are seeing through the camera&apos;s dispassionate eye. Sometimes I feel like a voyeur. At one point in the early film Five Easy Pieces, McQueen urinates and spits at the lens. He knows we are there. The city of cinemas is really a labyrinth. I&apos;m led by excitement, expectation and trepidation. You don&apos;t know who or what you&apos;ll find in there: men cruising and kissing in Venice&apos;s Giardini in the dark. South African miners far underground, digging for gold in deplorable conditions. People armed with nothing more than a spade, who have given up everything to pan for the mineral coltan in Congo, which feeds the mobile phone and laptop industry in the west. A dead horse, immobile in the waving grass. McQueen&apos;s cousin Marcus, talking about how he accidentally shot and killed his own brother, the camera&apos;s view fixed on the back of Marcus&apos;s static head, as if he himself were laying on the slab. Moving from colour to black and white, noise to silence, the present to the past and back again, McQueen&apos;s exhibition is filled with disjunctions, echoes and difficulties. Difficulties can also be pleasures. The disjunctions in his work, the surprises and disorientations \u2013 references to structuralist film-making, queer cinema and black radical film; nods to Jean Luc Godard, Gillo Pontecorvo, Yasujiro Ozu and Jean Vigo among others; a fascination with the aftermath of empire and colonialism, sexuality and questions of race \u2013 have all given us a body of work as rich and complex as any artist&apos;s or film-maker&apos;s. The works that might be regarded as mainstream movies continue his work by other means.     Bear: McQueen's 1993 work features the artist wrestling another man. Photograph: Marian Goodman Gallery and Thomas Dane Gallery    The intense physicality of his films is striking \u2013 whether he&apos;s filming himself wrestling another black man in Bear or, in recent work End Credits (2012), filling a screen with the scrolled-through documentation of the FBI&apos;s decades-long surveillance and harassment of the actor, singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson. All we see are dirty photocopies of old documents, with their hastily scribbled side-notes and blacked-out redactions, constantly scrolling down the screen a little too fast for us to keep up. The effect is like drowning. The FBI&apos;s relentless judgmental narrative of Robeson&apos;s every move, made worse by the calm voiceover that reads extracts in a measured voice, is a chilling record of the exercise of power, and Robeson&apos;s equally concerted effort to fight against it. The dynamic is palpable, almost physically present. This feel for the textures and materiality of the world runs right through McQueen&apos;s work. I think of the floor-mopping scene in the H-Block prison corridor in Hunger, our intense proximity to a couple having sex against a plate-glass window in Shame, and the way his super-8 camera delves into a hole left by an unexploded bomb as it buried itself in a building in Basra in Unexploded. There is a sense of the larger story, the before and after of each moment, even in his most physical films. And however concrete his subject, there is always a feeling of ambiguity \u2013 that what he describes is open to multiple readings. McQueen&apos;s sense of atmosphere is even embedded in the texture of film itself. The graininess of the footage shot in the underground world in Western Deep heightens the sense of crepuscular light. The fug of skunk and Tricky&apos;s asthmatic rasp as he records the song Girls in Girls (Tricky), a film shot in a claustrophobic recording studio and projected in an even more claustrophobic cube at Schaulager, all give the sense that you are as much inside McQueen&apos;s films as watching them. He messes with our sense of autonomy and distance. He seduces and shoves us away, and compromises our position as spectators. Leaving a West End cinema in 2011 after watching Hunger, I had to wade through the buckets of uneaten popcorn that littered the cinema. You wouldn&apos;t take someone to see Shame on a first date. McQueen&apos;s career now spans 20 years. There is a gathering feeling that everything he has to say is everywhere, all at once, throughout his work, and that his subject is the irreducible fact of being in the world, and our eventual leaving of it the only way out of its complexity.

Hendre Hall, Aber Road, Fri to 31 Mar JM Hidden Agenda, Dublin Having hosted a slew of big names from dance music&apos;s A list, promoters Hidden Agenda return to showcase an up-and-coming act, who make their Irish debut tonight. Despite only releasing their debut Starvin EP last year, Detroit Swindle have already played at some of Europe&apos;s finest clubs such as Panorama Bar, Tresor and Zoo Project. The only swindle here is that the duo are not actually from Detroit, but from Amsterdam, which is hardly a deal-breaker, given that Motor City-inspired deep house runs through these guys&apos; veins. Like their head-nodding and foot-itching DJ sets, Detroit Swindle&apos;s productions have been described as modern interpretations of classic soul tracks with melody-heavy grooves, jazzy chords and bumpy basslines.

It is also true that where the catwalks lead, the interior design world is not usually far behind. And so it has proved in New York this weekend. As the 12th annual Architectural Digest Show opened its doors to the public, a group of international bloggers prepared to tweet, post and Facebook what it sees to its followers. By the end of the four-day show the blogtourNYC, as it is known, will have reached a Twitter audience of over a million, generated 40m impressions and written more than 200 blog posts. In addition to the Architectural Digest show, they will also visit the showrooms of the tour&apos;s sponsors and various New York boutiques to see details of new and forthcoming collections. Blog Tour NYC had sponsors queuing up to bring bloggers to their product launches and it&apos;s a formula that seems to be working. Run by the online interior resource Modenus.com, this is the second New York blogtour and the second of five such tours this year. In January, a group of design bloggers travelled to Cologne. In April, another group will visit New Orleans, a different set will go back to London for the Design Festival in September and yet more to \u00a0Los Angeles in October. Each time they visit a city, bloggers from previous tours meet up with them and add their voices to the coverage.\u00a0 Gina Lubin, founder and creative director of Du Verre hardware, is sponsoring all five tours, which represents a significant financial commitment for a small company (other sponsors include Miele, Poggenphol and Blanco).\u00a0 &quot;We all have to find new ways to connect with customers and with such a diverse group of bloggers this is a really interesting and direct way to do that,&quot; she says. &quot;Time will tell which bloggers are really qualified to talk about design, but when we have the chance to engage with academics, colour consultants, interior designers and stylists all in one place it&apos;s a great opportunity that we cannot afford to miss.&quot; Veronika Miller, the founder of Modenus, says she wanted to bring design enthusiasts and brands together and no-one seemed to be doing what to her was an obvious solution. In 2010, she persuaded the AD show organisers to let her hold a small cocktail party to which she would bring some of the design bloggers she knew.\u00a0 Three years later there were more than 200 guests. &quot;Blogtour has become an huge virtual magazine and we realised after the first one that people were following the hashtag and were really interested to know what the bloggers were seeing and what they thought about it,&quot; says Miller. &quot;The bloggers can be really influential and the blogtourNYC helps increase their traffic and it helps the brands to launch their products so everyone wins. Everyone has a different take on what they see so it&apos;s really interesting all round.&quot; And what of the bloggers? This year&apos;s group includes six from the UK, seven Americans, a Dane, a German and one from Amsterdam. Lori\u00a0Gilder, an interior designer based in LA who blogs at Diaryofarenovation.com, says: &quot;Companies have been taking bloggers to see their products for a few years now but Modenus have taken this idea and put it on a much bigger scale with international bloggers and multiple sponsors. Companies don&apos;t need to spend on advertising when they can get their products out there really quickly this way.&quot; Mike Welton, who writes on architecture for The Washington Post and Dwell Magazine and who blogs at Architects + Artisans, says: &quot;This the right way to reach a larger audience of architecture and design aficionados. We are able to expose them instantly to a wide array of products, buildings and design concepts, particularly at the AD show.&quot; Other bloggers include interior designer Irene Turner, who has 4.5m Pinterest followers, \u00a0British stylist Emily Blunden, who has worked for The Guardian and Grazia, interior designer Zoe Brewer and Gem Barton, who lectures in interior architecture at Brighton University.\u00a0 Obviously a six-day, all-expenses trip to New York is not entirely without obligation. Bloggers are expected to write a least one blog post per sponsor. However, as they are being shown new products and given access to designers and CEOs for interview, they can usually find a story that fits with their own blogging style. Some choose to cover the social side of the event, others keep their posts very pictorial. The interior designers are usually very happy to see what&apos;s new and to examine at close quarters products they might want to suggest to their clients. Sponsors are thanked and credited in posts and on twitter so that the process is ultimately quite transparent. Miller says it&apos;s time bloggers were taken seriously. &quot;When the economy picks up, many of the bloggers will go back to their original jobs. Others will continue to post occasionally and there will remain a small core of really professional bloggers who have enormous expertise and the flexibility to bring their own vision to what they see. Some brands really get the importance of that already and they are getting in at the ground level of something that is growing really fast. &quot;Bloggers can be really flexible and as long as they keep to their side of the deal and show up on time and stick to deadlines then, they should be considered as another arm of the mainstream media providing extra content.&quot;\u00a0 Kate Watson-Smyth is freelance interiors and design writer who blogs at www.madaboutthehouse.com.

The Man Booker-shortlisted novelist and the Dutch composer have written an opera together, Sunken Garden, to be premiered by English National Opera next month. But even that stressful experience seems not to have soured their mutual admiration, which flips affectionately between them, batted back with a cheerful &quot;Get out of here!&quot; from Mitchell or &quot;Enough of the compliments!&quot; from Van der Aa. Mitchell says their first meeting was a bit like a &quot;speed date&quot;. The initial approach came from Van der Aa, winner of a Grawemeyer (the composing equivalent of a Nobel prize): he wrote to the author of Cloud Atlas and Black Swan Green, suggesting that they collaborate. &quot;Good art and good music always find a balance between form on the one hand, and poetry and human feeling on the other,&quot; he explains. &quot;Bach may be the prime example, and I found something similar in David&apos;s books. But I never expected to hear back from him.&quot; One day Mitchell was at a loose end in Amsterdam, and mentioned Van der Aa&apos;s email to his Dutch publisher. &quot;I almost didn&apos;t \u2013 it was one of those Garden of Forking Paths moments.&quot; The next thing he knew, he was sitting in a cafe with Van der Aa. &quot;We were like two dogs warily eyeing each other up,&quot; says Mitchell. Van der Aa adds: &quot;We talked a lot about opera and what opera should and shouldn&apos;t be. We talked about the building blocks for an opera: what is a text that invites itself to be sung. And we somehow got chatting about The Wire and Twin Peaks&quot; \u2013 shared obsessions, as it turned out. The idea for Sunken Garden gradually grew. Cloud Atlas was being adapted for film at the time, so they met at airports when Mitchell was shuttling between LA and his home in the west of Ireland. &quot;David would just be on his way back to Cork from a read-through with Tom Hanks.&quot; The novelist had already written one libretto, for Dutch composer Klaas de Vries, about the 2000 Enschede fireworks disaster, and says he enjoys breaking with the utter solitude of the novelist&apos;s life. &quot;You work on something for basically four years without speaking to anyone and you get lonely.&quot; Opera is the opposite, the supremely collaborative artform. &quot;No one person could begin to do this space-programme-sized project without a host of other people. And it was like playing table tennis with Michel when we were developing the libretto. You&apos;d knock him an idea and he&apos;d send it back with some crafty topspin, and you&apos;d put some backspin on to counter, and each time the manuscript got handed over it got better.&quot; The narrative, which Mitchell describes as &quot;an early offshoot of what my next novel might have been&quot;, has something of the film noir about it. (The pair describe it as &quot;an occult-mystery film opera&quot;.) Toby Kramer is a filmmaker investigating the disappearance of a software engineer, Simon Vines. His quest leads him to the sunken garden, a liminal place between life and death, where he meets psychiatrist Iris Marinus. (Mitchell&apos;s readers will recognise Dr Marinus from The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet.) There are hints throughout of Mitchell&apos;s novelistic preoccupations: the relationship between the body and the self, incorporeality, immortality, fate.           Van der Aa works in an unusual, if not unique, way. Sunken Garden is his third opera, and, like his last, After Life (based on the film of the same name by Hirokazu Koreeda), it will meld music and his own film; he also directs. Of Sunken Garden, he says: &quot;I wrote what I felt worked best with the libretto to bring it to the audience. Sometimes that means soundscapey stuff, but also, sometimes, in-your-face dance music and electronic music, or pop music, almost. It&apos;s a very kaleidoscopic score with a very broad range of expression. And I sometimes use very realistic, documentary-style film, and sometimes\u00a0very abstract film, and everything\u00a0in between \u2013 it&apos;s all in service of the story.&quot; He has used 3D film to create the\u00a0sunken garden of the title: lush, colourful footage shot at Cornwall&apos;s Eden Project. &quot;It earns its place, or else it would just be a gimmick,&quot; Mitchell says. Why opera as a vehicle for telling this story? For Mitchell, it means abandoning control \u2013 letting actors, singers, designers, a conductor and musicians do much of what he would convey in words in a novel. He laughs, saying that he can see that his importance is dwindling &quot;the closer we get to launch date, or what is it? Premiere. This is what I call the storm dilemma. When you write a storm in prose, you do everything. You need some fresh metaphors to do the noise; you have to do two pages to make it really stormy. In a screenplay or libretto you just write &apos;storm&apos;.&quot; (He gave the same reason when asked in a recent Guardian interview why he had not adapted Cloud Atlas for film himself: he didn&apos;t want to be the guy who wrote &quot;storm&quot;.) Van der Aa chips in. &quot;The converse is\u00a0that he writes two words in his libretto, &apos;vertical pond&apos;, and it costs thousands of pounds to make it. Two words and it&apos;s like, ker-ching! People have been working for weeks on inventing the vertical pond in the visual effects department.&quot; So, notwithstanding the &quot;storm dilemma&quot;, what can opera do? &quot;It&apos;s the human warmth,&quot; says Mitchell, &quot;the fact that these are humans just like you, singing this stuff. There is something sacred in the human connection between the performers and the audience. They could screw up, or fall over \u2013 it&apos;s a high-wire act. There&apos;s a tensile cord between you and the performers that&apos;s only there when it&apos;s in real time, when real human beings are producing these extraordinary sounds.&quot; That argument works for theatre, too: why add music? Van der Aa argues that &quot;music has the possibility of being non-specific. Music frees you from realism. You can leave the distance between the audience and the subject of the piece slightly bigger than in film.&quot; Mitchell excitedly expands. &quot;There&apos;s a spectrum in art, with specificity at one end and ambiguity at the other. Fiction is at the ambiguous end. Take the characters in Cloud Atlas. There are as many ways of seeing the characters as there are readers \u2013 until it&apos;s filmed. I know that my Timothy Cavendish will never be anyone other than Jim Broadbent, and Jim Broadbent&apos;s Timothy Cavendish is even there in my next book. Theatre has something of this quality: this room looks like this, this character looks like this. But music is on the ambiguous end.&quot; Anyway, they say, what kind of a question is that: why opera? &quot;It&apos;s rather Anglo-Saxon,&quot; says Van der Aa. &quot;In Europe, people don&apos;t question that you spend quite a bit of money on opera.&quot; Mitchell says the question reminds him of hearing another novelist, Howard Jacobson perhaps, being asked &quot;What is literature for?&quot; at a festival. The answer came back: &quot;What a delightfully childlike question. You may as well ask: &apos;What is the moon for?&apos;&quot;", "sentences": ["But I never expected to hear back from him.&quot; One day Mitchell was at a loose end in Amsterdam, and mentioned Van der Aa&apos;s email to his Dutch publisher."], "title": "David Mitchell: 'In a libretto you just write \"storm\"'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/25/sunken-garden-david-mitchell-michel-van-der-aa", "tags": ["Opera", "Books", "Culture", "David Mitchell", "Classical music", "Music"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-03-27T18:56:54Z", "article": "  The grim weather at home is sending millions of Britons abroad in search of guaranteed sunshine over the Easter break, according to travel agents and holiday firms who have reported a surge in last-minute bookings and the strongest demand for seasonal beach holidays in a decade. Despite the prospect of travel chaos on roads and at airports as a result of the freezing weather and icy conditions \u2013 in what is predicted to be the coldest Easter since 1910 \u2013 airports are bracing themselves for the start of the busiest holiday weekend so far this year. A threatened strike on Thursday by French workers at Calais, Dunkirk, Dieppe and Cherbourg could also delay ferries. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) predicts that more than 1.7 million British holidaymakers will head overseas for the Easter weekend, compared with 1.5 million last year. Spain is the UK&apos;s favourite foreign holiday destination, with the Canaries and the Balearics the most popular areas, and Egypt and Tunisia also top choices. Favourite city break destinations are Paris, Dublin, Amsterdam, Rome and New York, while France and Austria \u2013 where great snow conditions have allowed many resorts to extend their seasons \u2013 are the most popular for skiers. Mark Tanzer, chief executive of Abta, said: &quot;After two wet summers and no end in sight to the winter many Britons are desperate for some sunshine. We&apos;ve seen a surge in last-minute bookings to warm destinations.&quot; The holiday company TUI Travel, which owns Thomson and First Choice, said online bookings to resorts such as Fuerteventura in the Canaries, Greece and Tunisia were up 73%, 45% and 37% respectively compared with last year. Garry Wilson, managing director of purchasing for Thomson and First Choice, said: &quot;With predicted highs of 24C in Fuerteventura, Canary Islands, and 20C in Hammamet, Tunisia, on Easter Sunday versus just six degrees in London and four degrees in Manchester it&apos;s easy to see why people are heading south for the long weekend.&quot; Thomas Cook said almost half its 28,000 bookings for Easter were to the Canary Islands, with Mexico the top long-haul destination. The knock-on effect is brisk business at the airports \u2013 Heathrow is preparing for its busiest seven days of the year so far, expecting to handle up to 1.2 million passengers passing through its five terminals between Thursdayand next Tuesday. Thursday will be the busiest single day, with over 116,000 people heading abroad for last-minute skiing or guaranteed sunshine. Regional airports, ferry terminals and the Channel Tunnel are expected to be busy. But a stoppage involving members of Force Ouvriere \u2013 who help marshal traffic \u2013 could lead to delays for ferry passengers. More than 60,000 passengers will be taking continental Eurostar services from the UK to France and Belgium over the Easter break, the company said \u2013 with many travelling to Euro Disney for the ongoing 20th anniversary celebrations. The tourism agency VisitEngland said 2.7 million Britons planned to take an overnight trip during the Easter weekend. Blockbuster new London exhibitions such as Pompeii at the British Museum and David Bowie at the V&amp;A are expected to be big draws. The RAC expects more than seven million motorists to be heading for a getaway in the UK or Europe, preparing for a &quot;roads rush&quot; by scheduling an extra 10% patrol hours for the four days from Good Friday. There could be gridlock in some areas with outstanding roadworks still in place, including a section of the M1 near Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire as well as part of the M4 near Reading in Berkshire. The busiest &quot;getaway&quot; periods will be Thursday and Good Friday morning, extending through until Saturday. According to Trafficmaster the most congested stretches of motorway are likely to include all sections of the M25 \u2013 especially both ways around junctions 14-17 (Heathrow airport and M4, M40 interchanges) and parts of the M1. Network Rail said rail passengers were unlikely to suffer any disruption, although passengers travelling via Reading station will face diversions as a result of an ongoing \u00a3900m refurbishment.

There&apos;s an irresistible cultural historical connection between the two, as churches and concert halls around the world will resound with Bach&apos;s Passions and choral masterpieces this weekend. (Not least tonight, when the BBC Singers perform and broadcast a version of the lost St Mark Passion at St George&apos;s Bristol; meanwhile, the Royal Albert Hall is gearing up for John Eliot Gardiner&apos;s Bach Marathon on Monday, whose performance of the B Minor Mass will be the climax of Radio 3&apos;s month-long Baroque Spring.) Thanks to harpsichordist Mahan Esfahani earlier this week \u2013 whose earthy and ecstatic performance of the Goldberg Variations on Wednesday can be listened to here until 3 April, the performance begins eight minutes in \u2013 I experienced a shock of the old and the new, a minor revelation about how the performance practice of baroque music, especially Bach, has changed over the last few decades. Mahan played me this: Wilhelm Mengelberg&apos;s performance of the St Matthew Passion from 2 April 1939 at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. As Mahan said, if we think we know how Bach goes, thanks to the insights and excitements of the early music movement, and that Norrington, Hogwood, Reinhard Goebel et al have sorted out all the problems for us, we need to think again. (You can, incidentally, listen to that triumvirate of early music maestri on Music Matters on Saturday.) How can we pretend to understand what Bach might have done three centuries ago, Esfahani said, if we can&apos;t take seriously what Mengelberg was doing 74 years ago? And that&apos;s the point: when you hear the opening of Mengelberg&apos;s performance, your first reaction, as a well-trained baroquophile, may well be laughter. It&apos;s too slow! That portamento in the strings! The changes of speed \u2013 he gets even slower and can&apos;t help mucking about with the phrasing! The ludicrously large choir and orchestra! Wrong, wrong, wrong! It&apos;s a comparable reaction, I would suggest, to how some critics thought of the early music revolution in the 1970s and 1980s (as Robert Layton quipped in Gramophone: &quot;We need a revival of period strings as much as we need a revival of period dentistry&quot;). Which is not to suggest that one is &quot;right&quot; and the other &quot;wrong&quot;: it&apos;s exactly that kind of thinking that is the problem. Listen again to Mengelberg&apos;s performance. Its sincerity, the ebb and flow of its phrasing, the sound of the choir \u2013 as if a whole people were bearing witness to the Passion, and were themselves part of the story \u2013 amounts to the revelation of a different Bach from the one we&apos;re used to hearing today. It&apos;s historically &quot;authentic&quot; in the sense that this is music making that consecrates the moment of its creation, and is part of a tradition of Bach playing that may seem completely foreign to our ears but which belongs utterly to its time. Now, you don&apos;t have to like it (and there are some truly jaw-dropping shifts of tempo within even single phrases of the arias), but I think you do have to respect its integrity and intensity. No less than any other conductor or group of musicians, Mengelberg and his players and singers are trying to make each moment count, trying to realise the searing expressive power of this music within the frame of their understanding of the piece \u2013 and they do so with a wider range of articulation and musical insight than many other performers have done since, period instruments or no period instruments. If we truly believe in the power of Bach&apos;s music to communicate across the centuries and across the globe, we have to accept that it can survive a vast kaleidoscope of interpretations. That means being open to the continuing illumination of historical research and experimentation, but it also means being alive to the ways that his music has been played and heard in the past, and accepting the myriad other meanings that previous generations of performers have found in his music. For more shocks of the old, listen to Oistrakh&apos;s magnificently subtle, supple concertos, or Klemperer&apos;s granite-hewn Mass in B Minor. There are limits though: where Oistrakh, Mengelberg and Klemperer find, in their own ways, a truly Bachian range of expression and experience, Karajan seems to smother Bach in a Wagnerian ooze. The signal lesson of the early music movement is not to take anything for granted in how we think about, play and listen to this music \u2013 and that applies to the early music movement itself.

In Russia, which I visited on behalf of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) last October, I heard how xenophobia and intolerance, including antisemitism, fuel hate crimes by skinhead groups. In Belarus, the anti-Jewish utterances of President Lukashenko and the state media are coupled by a failure to identify or punish the vandals of Jewish cemeteries and other property. In Hungary, my parents&apos; native country, the leader of its third largest party recently urged the government to create a list of Jews posing &quot;a national security threat&quot; \u2013 even as the government, including its parliament, condemned this statement.  Even in western Europe, where some of America&apos;s strongest historic allies reside, antisemitism also remains. Since 2000, anti-Jewish graffiti increasingly has appeared in Paris and Berlin, Madrid and Amsterdam, London and Rome, and synagogues have been vandalized or set ablaze in France and Sweden. In Malmo, Sweden, physical attacks have fueled a Jewish exodus. A generation ago, Malmo was home to 2,000 Jews; today there are fewer than 700. In France, &quot;unprecedented violence&quot; took place last year, according to a recent report by the security unit of France&apos;s Jewish community (pdf). There were 614 antisemitic incidents in 2012, compared to 389 in 2011. Earlier this February, a woman was arrested in Toulouse, France after trying to stab a student at the Ohr HaTorah Jewish day school where four Jews were shot and killed in March 2012. Who are the perpetrators of these hateful acts? Some are neo-Nazis or members of skinhead groups. Others are religious extremists who distort the religion of Islam to advance their own intolerant agendas. Most are hostile to democracy and pluralism. I am reminded of the recently unearthed statements of Egypt&apos;s President Morsi, depicting the Jewish people as &quot;descendants of apes and pigs&quot; whom Egyptian &quot;children and grandchildren&quot; must hate, &quot;down to the last generation&quot;. As the daughter of Holocaust survivors, I found Morsi&apos;s comments evoked Europe&apos;s dark past from his Middle East locale. Compounding the problem are four factors. First, European officials remain reluctant to identify the ideological or religious motivations of the perpetrators. Second, surveys show that negative attitudes towards Jews among Europe&apos;s population remain widespread. Third, these surveys confirm that some of this bias reveals itself through certain criticisms of the state of Israel: while no country is beyond reproach, when criticism includes language intended to delegitimize Israel, demonize its people, and apply to it standards to which no other state is held, we must call it antisemitism.  Finally, as USCIRF has documented, a number of European governments and political parties have added fuel to the fire by backing restrictions on vital religious practices. At least four countries \u2013 Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland \u2013 ban kosher slaughter. Authorities and political forces in Norway and Germany also have tried to ban infant male circumcision. These restrictions affect Muslims, as well. What helps drive them is a monolithic secular ideology, which, like the monolithic state religion it replaced, views serious practitioners of Judaism, Islam, and other belief systems as outsiders. It also suggests a striking indifference to Europe&apos;s past persecution of Judaism.  Fortunately, over the past decade, Europe&apos;s largest human rights body, the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), has taken firm stands against religious bigotry, including antisemitism. Humanitarian concerns demand nothing less.  Yet, there are other reasons to care. When Jews face trouble, so often do other minorities. And as the second world war taught a whole generation of Americans, the same forces targeting Jews often oppose freedom for all. The fight against antisemitism is a key element in freedom&apos;s battle against tyranny. It is a fight to preserve civilization and further human progress.  To paraphrase Eric Hoffer, an American author writing half a century ago, as it goes with the Jews, so will it go with all of us. We are all in this together. As we recall Europe&apos;s darkest days, let this be our response to antisemitism.

Merian, who was born in Frankfurt into the family of a Swiss engraver and publisher, had been fascinated by the life cycles of butterflies and made their transformations the subject of close studies. She became a flower-painter and teacher and, at the age of 52, made an expedition to what is now Suriname after she was inspired by exotic specimens imported from the Dutch colonies for the natural history collections of the Netherlands. During her time in South America, she travelled around the Dutch colony, sketching local animals and plants but also criticising the treatment of indigenous people and black slaves by Dutch planters.

Long before the camera was invented, she acted as the world&apos;s eyes by painting stunning and scientifically accurate pictures of flowers and later, of insects.  Although she was one of the world&apos;s first entomologists, it&apos;s likely you have never heard of her: she certainly is not as well-known as she deserves to be \u2013 even among professional entomologists. This sad reality may be the motivation behind Google honouring her with a specially designed Google Doodle today, on the 366th anniversary of her birth in Frankfurt am Main.  Merian was a remarkable individual. Not only was she an accomplished artist, but she was also an excellent naturalist and a bold explorer, too. After separating from her artist-husband, she relocated to Amsterdam with her two daughters and supported her family by selling her paintings. But Merian soon became spellbound by the stunning array of tropical flora and fauna that returning travelers brought with them from the Dutch colony of Suriname, located in South America. Her extraordinary talents and unusual interests quickly gained her numerous invitations to view many of the natural history collections amassed by the wealthy elites of Amsterdam.  Inspired by her passion for flowers and insects (particularly butterflies), Merian was determined to visit Suriname so she could study and paint the local insects and plants from living individuals instead of from pinned or prepared specimens. She worked hard; painting and studying the local collections for eight years before the city of Amsterdam awarded her a grant to travel to Suriname to paint its flora and fauna \u2013 an almost unheard of achievement at the time because such grants were typically awarded only to men.  Accompanied by her younger daughter, Dorothea, the women set sail for Suriname in 1699. After two years, Merian fell ill with malaria so she and her daughter cut their work short and returned to Amsterdam. Despite her illness, Merian published her Magnus Opus, Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium, three years later. This beautiful book is filled with paintings of Suriname&apos;s plants and animals, especially of moths and butterflies, as well as beetles and spiders, and even paintings of snakes and lizards. Many of these tropical species were unknown to Europeans at the time.  Debilitated by a stroke in 1715 that left her partially paralysed, Merian died a pauper in 1717 at the age of 70. But her passion for insects had changed science forever. Contrary to the prevailing notion of the day that insects spontaneously arose from the mud, Merian discovered this was not at all true. She was one of the first naturalists who actually cultivated live insects, which gave her powerful insights into their natural history and behaviours. Merian was one of the first scientists to learn that many insects go through distinct developmental stages and, through her lavish and accurate paintings, she was the first to document these life stages for the public.  As an artist, Merian&apos;s work had a strong influence upon scientific illustration. In addition to the accuracy and realism of her paintings, Merian&apos;s pictures of insects were the first to depict all the different life stages and the chrysalis for each species on its particular food plant. Once ridiculed for her fierce independence and for her unladylike devotion to painting pictures of insects, Merian is now recognised as one of the best insect (and flower) scientific illustrators of her day \u2013 and indeed, of all time.  This video will give you some appreciation for Merian&apos;s beautiful paintings and drawings:            [video link] You can learn more about Maria Sibylla Merian&apos;s extraordinary life and work in Kim Todd&apos;s biography; Chrysalis: Maria Sibylla Merian and the Secrets of Metamorphosis [Amazon UK; Amazon US].

Click here to listen Hometown: London, Paris, Amsterdam.  The lineup: Cole Williams (vocals, music).  The background: Cole Williams is the Child of Lov but, despite that name, he isn&apos;t peddling a latterday medallion man persona. The letters actually stand for Light, Oxygen and Voltage, and it&apos;s something to do with plants. Actually, he kind of is peddling a latterday medallion man persona: the music on his self-titled debut album is of the deconstructed Southern Soul variety, all muggy atmosphere and pitch-shifted vocals. One brilliant early description suggested it sounded like the Wu-Tang Clan&apos;s RZA behind the mixing desk at Muscle Shoals.  To begin with, he had no persona at all. He was one of those anonymous/mysterious blog anti-characters who declined to be photographed and revealed little information about himself. Turns out it&apos;s a 25-year-old former graphic design student called Cole Williams who flits between European cities and has been said to resemble Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The point is, he doesn&apos;t much look like Barry White and the immediate impression is of someone like R&amp;B munchkin Har Mar Superstar \u2013 only at the opposite end of the height range, because he&apos;s six feet tall \u2013 playing with or even parodying his chosen medium.  Still, if it&apos;s a joke, it&apos;s a good one - he&apos;s got rapper DOOM to appear on his album as well as Erykah Badu / Flying Lotus bassist Thundercat and Damon Albarn, whose studio 13 the album was recorded in. And Trey Reames, &quot;the man who had been responsible for the formation of Gnarls Barkley&quot; according to the press release, is his manager so clearly there are serious intentions behind the playful exterior.  The music doesn&apos;t sound deliberately tongue-in-cheek, but it does sound like an indie artist striving to achieve the effortless sensuality of a D&apos;Angelo. This isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing; in fact, it creates an interesting tension, and the same could be said of some of our favourite recent artists such as How To Dress Well and Holy Other, although in those two instances the musical atmosphere is more solemn. With the Child of Lov, as with Gnarls Barkley, there is always a hint of a smile, even if it&apos;s a malevolent one. Track one, Call Me Up, is comically woozy, like OutKast&apos;s Miss Jackson on downers. As with much of the record, it moves at a narcotically slow speed, a pace that makes you question what the artist has been ingesting. Heal is faster, with a jabbing guitar note, and treated/tweaked falsetto vocals like someone having an excitable reaction to something funky. One Day (featuring Albarn) is stoned, trip hop-torpid, doom-laden. Talking of DOOM, he appears on Owl, which has a sticky, dragging rhythm to match his viscous tones. Previous single Give Me is sparse, industrial, dissonant funk for Wire readers. The best track is the bluesy Fly which does indeed approximate the irritating buzz of the titular insect and goes straight onto our mixtape of tracks of the year so far along with SZA, Clipping, Rare Times et al. And then, just when we decided to file the Child of Lov under &quot;interesting leftfield experiment with zero commercial prospects&quot; Cole goes and closes the show with Give It to the People, with a sample of the Young Rascals&apos; Groovin&apos; and a chorus that is deeply catchy in an off-kilter novelty reggae way. If and when it becomes a hit, we&apos;ll stop laughing.  The buzz: &quot;It&apos;s modern soul music of epic proportions&quot; \u2013 Zane Lowe.  The truth: He&apos;s Jamiroquai in a cartoon version of hell.  Most likely to: Cee-Lo, wave goodbye.  Least likely to: Become a superstar.

What would he rather do: win the Europa League or qualify for the Champions League? The England midfielder believes it is tough to decide and he looked to wriggle clear by saying that he wants both, which speaks for his indefatigable spirit if not quite the spirit of the debate. Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas has also maintained since becoming manager last summer that the two ought to be regarded as achievable goals. With Tottenham preparing for a Europa League quarter-final, first leg at home to Basel on Thursday night and lying third in the Premier League, he may be proved correct. Yet in terms of what would taste the sweeter, what would be the most cherished in the years ahead, when stories to grandchildren enter the equation, Parker was clear and even Villas-Boas appeared to waver from the party line. If football is about romance and glory, then Tottenham lifting the Europa League trophy in Amsterdam on 15 May could not be topped. &quot;As a player, I can see that argument 100%,&quot; Parker said. &quot;As a player, there is nothing more rewarding than going to a final and lifting a trophy but we knew at the outset what we needed to do this season. So we&apos;ll probably look to take both. &quot;Of course, for me personally, a trophy would be something to look back on more. I was at Chelsea when we won the league and Carling Cup [in 2004-05] so I saw what those days do for the fans and for your family, as well. I was injured for the final but I went along so I have some sort of understanding of how good those days are. I&apos;d love to be part of them again.&quot; That Parker played only a peripheral role in Chelsea&apos;s first double due to injury further fires him. He made only four appearances in the league, which was not enough to qualify him for a medal and, although the club cast him a replica, he prizes it so little that he says he does not know where it is. The Carling Cup felt slightly different, as he started in the first three rounds, but when Parker tots up the official medal haul from his 16-year career, it extends no further than the old division one title with Charlton Athletic in 2000 and the Intertoto Cup with Newcastle United in 2006. &quot;I know for a fact that every one of us in that changing room wants to go on and try to win something,&quot; Parker said. &quot;The Europa League is a big competition, with big teams in it, and if you win it, you&apos;ve done bloody well.&quot; Attitudes in England towards the Europa League tend to be a little condescending, as though the tournament is marooned in some sort of hinterland, charged purely with distracting teams from the serious domestic business and not fit to share the same airspace as the more handsome and prosperous Champions League. Europe&apos;s elite competition has become the ideal to be chased at all costs, with membership perpetuating a cycle involving glamorous stages, money and status, plus star players, who want each of the aforementioned. Tottenham had a wild adventure on their involvement in 2010-11, when they reached the quarter-finals and it served to whet the appetite, not least in the financial department, although the Premier League&apos;s incoming \u00a35bn collective TV deal would appear to put even Champions League revenues in the shade. Tottenham have prioritised readmission via league position but Villas-Boas&apos;s pursuit of the Europa League has been refreshing. Were he to fall short on both fronts, the demands of Europe&apos;s second-tier tournament would surely be blamed, and yet it is possible to construct a case for Tottenham&apos;s league form so far owing much to their seriousness in the Europa League. It helped the players, initially, to become familiar with Villas-Boas&apos;s match-day methods and it has since served to build mentality and momentum. Villas-Boas made the point on Wednesday that the knockout-phase victories over Lyon and Internazionale had been invaluable experiences for the future that they hope to shape. Tottenham fans of particular vintages will always remember the Uefa Cup triumphs of 1972 and 1984, and it is questionable whether the Champions League campaign of two seasons ago, albeit one that was extremely enjoyable, will stand the same test of time. Context is key, and it should also be noted that Tottenham have won only one FA Cup and two League Cups since 1984. &quot;Your league position always dictates the success of a season,&quot; said Villas-Boas, who reported that the striker Jermain Defoe was out for two weeks with an abdominal tear. &quot;But winning trophies is also tremendously important. Chelsea finished sixth last season but it was totally overshadowed by the fact they won two trophies, including the biggest in the world [the Champions League] and so it was deemed a successful season.&quot;", "sentences": ["If football is about romance and glory, then Tottenham lifting the Europa League trophy in Amsterdam on 15 May could not be topped."], "title": "Tottenham's Scott Parker puts European trophy above top-four finish", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/03/tottenham-scott-parker-european-trophy", "tags": ["Tottenham Hotspur", "Basel", "Scott Parker", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-04-04T00:01:57Z", "article": "Real Madrid could face punishment after Sergio Ramos and Xabi Alonso appeared to deliberately seek yellow cards against Galatasaray in the quarter-final first leg in order to miss the second leg and arrive clear of cards for the semi-final.

Medical abortion pills bought online carry risk: outside of the few reputable providers you can never be 100% sure what you&apos;re getting. Access to high quality, professional advice and aftercare is also crucial, and our fear for women buying medical abortion drugs online is that they may not seek this out if needed. Talk to young people to find out what they want: services must be designed around their answers. For example, the location of clinics, opening hours, the kind of non judgmental attitude they are looking for in the healthcare professionals who work there - this differs from country to country, there&apos;s no one size fits all approach. Mara Clarke, director of the Abortion Support Network Falling government abortion statistics can be misleading: we know of many women who give the address of a friend or relative or a fake address, plus literally hundreds if not thousands who have accessed early medical abortion pills online, or worse, who self aborted in other more dangerous ways. As well as women who go to Amsterdam and Brussels for abortions. And women who have wanted abortions but who could not afford them who had unwanted children. Abortion provision is a postcode lottery: in England, Scotland and Wales where abortion is supposedly available, there is a postcode lottery of provision as there is with many areas of healthcare. That said, as an American living in the UK, the provision of sexual and reproductive health care here is much better than it is in the US, provided you either have a pro choice/informed GP or know where to look. Laura Hurley, senior project worker at Brook Abortion is taught in RE as an abstract, moral issue: a big part of the problem is that teachers are feel anxious about teaching about abortion, so they are pleased to accept the offer of free speakers who cover the topic. Unfortunately, it is mainly anti-abortion groups which provide this service. We try to encourage teachers to deliver the lesson (whether it be PSHE or RE) themselves, using resources from reliable sexual health organisations. Crisis pregnancy centres are barriers to accessing unbiased care: Independent counselling centres for pregnant women are nearly always run by anti-abortion organisations. Our own research suggests that a worrying number are giving out false, biased information on abortion. Some of these centres deliberately target young women, and a visit to one of these centres could be a real barrier to accessing timely abortion care. Emma Campbell, member at Alliance for Choice In Northern Ireland sex education in schools is incredibly poor: this is mandatory but at the discretion of heads who often call in lobbying or religious groups who do not give young people the full and unbiased story about what is available. Many young people come to university in NI without even the most basic knowledge of contraception and STI prevention, never mind abortion services. Media stereotypes must be challenged: soap and film storylines where abortion features, are often wildly inaccurate and never illustrate how relieved many people are once they have had the abortion they wanted. We need to try and be less judgemental and more practical. Doortje Braeken, senior adviser on adolescents and young people at the International Planned Parenthood Federation Provide support in a medium relevant to young people: we should find ways of educating on abortion and where to get information and access without intermediaries like teachers or educators using mobile technology or online for instance. In America access is becoming increasingly difficult: due to the well organised and well funded anti-choice groups and policticians who endorse their ideology. In sub-Saharan Africa, the issue of abortion is being overshadowed by HIV prevention and other issues. However, at this moment, in some countries there is increasing recognition to have a more comprehensive sexuality education approach which includes abortion and access to services. Abortion has hidden costs: even though abortion is free to access in the rest of the UK, there may be costs associated with needing to travel and to find childcare. This is especially true for the minority of women who are accessing abortion later on in pregnancy.

In the event, the museum closed its doors in 2003 and was due to reopen by 2006. But, dogged by innumerable delays, including a catastrophic tendering process, problems with asbestos and protests by cycling campaigners, it has been shut for a decade, losing an exhausted director along the way. Now, finally, the \u20ac375m (\u00a3318m) overhaul is virtually complete and \u2013 amid huge national anticipation and excitement \u2013 the museum is due to reopen its doors to the public on 13 April, after an inauguration by Queen Beatrix, one of her last engagements before she abdicates at the end of the month. In a new era of economic uncertainty, and spending cuts to Dutch culture, the project feels like it will be one of the last of its kind for many years. On a chilly Amsterdam morning, gardeners were still busily laying turf in the museum gardens as an enormous digital clock above the entrance counted down the nine days before the royal visit. Inside, the magnificent galleries smelled of fresh paint and new carpets, signalling the complete renewal of every aspect of the museum. Only the position of The Night Watch, the &quot;altarpiece&quot; of the museum, according to Wim Pijbes, the museum&apos;s director since 2008, has remained the same. Everything else \u2013 the architecture, curatorial philosophy and display \u2013 has been rethought. The long-awaited results are so spectacular that the museum looks likely to prove a model to other institutions for years to come. The architects, Spanish practice Cruz and Ortiz, have attempted to return the ornate building \u2013 built in 1885 by Pierre Cuypers \u2013 back to some of its original splendour. Over the years, many of its elaborate frescoed walls and terrazzo floors had been painted over or removed, and galleries divided up into smaller, white-walled spaces. Now, heavily decorated floors and walls have been reinstated \u2013 &quot;a whole new generation of craftspeople have been trained to do it,&quot; said Taco Dibbits, the museum&apos;s director of collections. What defeated the architects and the museum directorship was, in the end, a plan to block a cycle path that runs right through the museum, separating its east and west wings. The Fietsersbond (Dutch Cyclists&apos; Union) objected to the loss of the path \u2013 and won. According to Dibbits, &quot;The bicycle is folkloric in the Netherlands. Touch the bicycle, and you touch freedom.&quot; Now, to access each end of the ground floor (site of the 18th- and 19th-century collections) visitors must either go via the below-sea-level basement \u2013 fruit of a hugely complex engineering project, where an airy new entrance hall, auditorium, cafe and shop have been created \u2013 or via the galleries above, which house matchless Rembrandts, Vermeers, Steens and De Hoochs. Pijbes is philosophical about the sacrifice, but voiced concerns about the potential clash of art-lovers with fast-moving two-wheeled commuters. &quot;We might have 2 million visitors per year, and I am concerned about safety and security. If safety becomes an issue, the bikes have to leave.&quot;     Model of 74-gun Dutch battleship William Rex displayed in 17th century gallery of the Rijksmuseum. Photograph: Michael Kooren/Reuters    For the new displays, the rulebook was thrown out. Traditionally, the collection, which contains fine and applied art from the medieval to the modern era, with an emphasis on masterpieces of the Dutch golden age, was shown according to curatorial department. Sculpture was in the sculpture section, ceramics in the ceramics galleries, and so on. A new approach, however, sees the whole collection, regardless of object type, laid out in a single chronological sweep, with each section devoted to a different century. In a gallery devoted to the young Rembrandt, for example, examples of his early work, including his ravishing self-portrait of 1628-9, are set near finely worked glass and silver by makers Rembrandt knew, furniture of the period, and a portrait by his friend Jan Lievens of Constantijn Huygens, an important patron of the arts. &quot;You get a sense of the world in which Rembrandt was producing his art,&quot; said Dibbits. Though 8,000 objects are on show, the philosophy for the curators when selecting the display was &quot;less is more&quot; \u2013 in keeping, said Dibbits, with the often simple aesthetic of Dutch craftsmanship, pointing out the plain, almost modernist-looking pewter communion vessels that had once adorned Amsterdam&apos;s greatest church. Curators had to ruthlessly edit their selections for the display (&quot;kill their darlings,&quot; as Dibbits put it) to create an atmosphere that was uncluttered and allowed visitors to &quot;appreciate each work of art&quot;, he said. &quot;We wanted a display that was about time and beauty,&quot; he added. The objects are shown against walls in a severe palette of shades of grey; and the latest non-reflective ultra-transparent glass has been used for display cases, allowing visitors to appreciate the full effect of seeing, say, 17th-century bronzes set next to mannerist paintings, or medieval wooden devotional sculptures juxtaposed with early Flemish painting. Labels are concise \u2013 60 words maximum \u2013 and the galleries are free of computers and screens. As Duncan Bull, senior curator of foreign paintings, pointed out the subtle connections between a display of Italian paintings, bronzes and ceramics, meant to conjure up the atmosphere of a Renaissance studiolo, he said: &quot;We want people to educate themselves by hints, not to preach at them.&quot; According to Dibbits, the approach of British Museum director Neil MacGregor&apos;s Radio 4 series, A History of the World in 100 Objects, buoyed up his confidence in the ability of the artefacts to tell their own stories. &quot;I believe in the authencity, the authority of the objects themselves,&quot; he said. &quot;If people want more information, there is plenty they can download on to their smartphones,&quot; he added. Equally, much of the collection has been digitised and is available on the museum&apos;s website, &quot;for anyone to use, reuse \u2013 and to fire inspiration for artists, makers, scholars and students,&quot; said Pijbes. &quot;We want to open the institution up \u2013 so that it&apos;s no longer authoritarian, a ministry of good taste.&quot;     Delftware vases are on display in the 17th century gallery of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Photograph: Michael Kooren/Reuters    While he wants every Dutch schoolchild to come in and be able to see that national icon, The Night Watch, the entry fee for those over 18 is a hefty \u20ac15 (\u00a313) \u2013 necessary, said Pijbes, to balance the books; the museum expects to make \u20ac10-12m (\u00a38-10m) per year from ticketing. Steep cuts to Dutch culture funding mean that the museum has had to seek alternative revenue streams. A decade ago 70% of its revenue funding came from the government; now just 50%. &quot;At least,&quot; said Pijbes, &quot;it gives me more freedom.&quot; Meantime, between the Rijksmuseum and the newly refurbished Stedelijk Museum of modern and contemporary art, &quot;the government has invested over \u20ac500m in the city&apos;s cultural institutions,&quot; he said. None the less, he added, &quot;My dream is to have free access, as there is to UK national museums, for our national collection to be able to share it to the rest of the world.&quot; For now, that looks like an unrealisable ambition.

When I stepped off the plane in 1999, the colleague who drove me to my apartment introduced the city as &quot;the Liverpool of Japan&quot;. The analogy had to do with its position as an international port, as well as a spate of minor hits that the city&apos;s Mentai Rock scene produced in the early 1980s. That run of chart luck, unexpected for a city some 700 miles from Tokyo&apos;s hipsters, reinforced a local spirit of independence, and today Fukuoka seems to have outgrown its old Gateway-to-Kyushu label, seeing itself more as a Gateway to Asia. Its proximity to the Asian mainland has attracted a rich, cosmopolitan population, and with KLM having just launched direct flights from Europe, there&apos;s no reason why it can&apos;t vie for some of the international tourism afforded Honshu&apos;s big hitters. Returning here is never short of surprising. Whether it&apos;s the new Aitaka walkway \u2013 which edges you over the glistening Hakata Bay \u2013 or the expansion of already enviable shopping possibilities\u00a0with the immense Hankyu\u00a0mall, the city seems to be constantly improving itself. Importantly, none of this regeneration seems to be to the detriment of the older town, meaning that in a geographically compact space, you get a little of everything you might ask of Japan, be that the ancient temples and zen gardens at nearby Dazaifu, the hi-tech gadgetry on sale in the Tenjin district, or the craft-loving communities that dot the Itoshima peninsula to the west.     Canal City shopping mall, Fukuoka. Photograph: Alamy    However, it&apos;s the lingering flavour of Showa-era Fukuoka that continues to attract me most. If Liverpool had Mathew Street, Fukuoka has Oyafuko Dori, which translates pleasingly as Delinquents&apos; Street. This thin stretch leading between bustling Tenjin and the port warehouses is dotted with izakayas (traditional bars), nightclubs and the ubiquitous &quot;live houses&quot; in which the Mentai Rock movement flourished. By day, it looks like an anonymous side street, but by night it&apos;s where the city&apos;s musical youth flocks. It&apos;d be tempting to say these youngsters are hopeful of becoming the next Ayumi Hamasaki or Shiina Ringo, legends of the J-Pop and J-Rock scenes who spent their formative years in Fukuoka, but the feeling amongst many local artists tends to be &quot;make it here or die trying&quot;. Seoul is closer than Tokyo. Why move to the capital beat? There&apos;s a charm about Fukuoka&apos;s older shopping districts that is unique to the city. Lovers of the latest brands can happily throw their cash around all day long in the Hankyu or Parco malls, but for a taste of Fukuoka&apos;s more decadent character, it&apos;s good to take a walk from Nakasu Kawabata Station on Nakasu (a neon-specked island designed to keep the city&apos;s more eye-opening sights from the innocent) along the Hakata Kawabata Shotengai arcade to Canal City. This rusty promenade hangs on (just) as a home to some of Fukuoka&apos;s more traditional shops, with kimono artists lined up alongside the mentaiko\u00a0makers who specialise in the local roe delicacy that lent the Mentai rockers their name. The arcade is more alive in the earlier hours of the day, when it wakes to a dawn chorus of traders. Just before Kokutai Street sits Kushida Jinja, a fine example of an inner-city shrine still servicing the merchants it has looked after since the eighth century. Canal City is now well into its second decade, but the imposing red shopping mecca is still worth exploring en route to the Naka River. Built in the mid-1990s, it&apos;s something of an architectural wonder, complete with it&apos;s own mini system of waterways, a\u00a0small amphitheatre and an abundance of overhanging vegetation. At weekends, the amphitheatre is given over to a kind of branded busking \u2013 often a bit cheesy, but never less than consummately professional, and entirely free to the passerby. Better still, during the New Year celebrations, the shows take on a more classical air, and it&apos;s not unusual to come across the likes of a shamisen orchestra squeezed onto the tiny stage.     Nakasu noodle district. Photograph: Alamy    Evening is the best time to walk the banks of the Naka river, especially the strip between Canal City and the bridge to Nishi Nakasu. As night falls, out trundle the yatai stalls \u2013 small, mobile restaurants complete with built-in benches that specialise in the local tonkotsu ramen broth and sticks of yakitori meat. These first began to pop up among the second world war debris, offering warmth and community to impoverished locals, but they&apos;re a nationwide attraction now and, along with nearby Dazaifu and the further-flung hot springs of Kurokawa, they&apos;re among the region&apos;s biggest domestic draws. In truth, some are less friendly than others, and entering can be the Japanese equivalent of stepping into a dusty saloon as the piano singsong fizzles out. However, with so many stalls to choose from, picking the right one is a quick exercise in trial and error. Poke your head under the canopy and see what kind of reaction you get. If it&apos;s a beaming smile, you&apos;re likely to be there into the small hours. Food and nightlife There are yatai stalls in abundance across the centre of town, but the relatively new Toriyatai near the Otani Hotel in the Yakuin district is excellent, and even has its own shop attached, selling homemade goods. For a friendly start to a more involved night out, try the American-run Dark Room on Oyafuko Dori, which opens a popular beer garden on the roof during the summer months. Accommodation As befitting Kyushu&apos;s largest city, Fukuoka is not short on accommodation in all budget ranges. The Grand Hyatt benefits architecturally from being part of Canal City, and is within easy walking distance of Nakasu, Tenjin and Hakata districts. For something more traditional, Daimaru Besso is in Futsukaichi (a 15-minute express train ride from Hakata Station), and has its own onsen (natural hot spring) attached.

An Austrian Jew whose family suffered at the hands of the Nazis during the second world war, she, her older brother and parents were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau when she was 15, and only she and her mother came out again. But while Eva is one of many survivors of the Holocaust, there is an element of her story that makes her unique: her mother later married Anne Frank&apos;s father, making her, to an endlessly curious world, the posthumous stepsister of one of the war&apos;s most famous casualties. &quot;He was a very kind, wonderful man, and a loving stepfather,&quot; Eva says of Otto Frank. &quot;But he was very emotionally involved, still, with Anne and the preservation of her memory. Her presence became all-consuming in our lives.&quot; This was, she admits, an occasionally suffocating obsession. &quot;He talked about her continuously and, I must say, I did become a little jealous.&quot; As did her children decades later. &quot;My daughters wanted to know why their grandfather was always talking about somebody else, just as I would get upset when I was introduced as her stepsister. I would say, &apos;I&apos;m a person myself!&apos; But I realised you cannot be resentful of someone who is no longer living.&quot; Eva went on to have a full life and for four decades did not talk about her experiences in a concentration camp. It was only after Otto&apos;s death in 1980 that she felt compelled to take on the responsibility of keeping Anne Frank&apos;s name alive. She gave talks, visited schools and wrote books: Eva&apos;s Story in 1988, The Promise in 2006, which was aimed, like her stepsister&apos;s diary, at younger readers, and now After Auschwitz. &quot;I&apos;d written about life in the camps before, but nothing after that. It might sound ridiculous, but I found real life much more difficult. It took me a long time to find peace.&quot; Though much of the new book dwells on her struggle to put the past behind her, she also addresses the stepsister she hardly knew in life. Born a month before Anne, the two girls shared a circle of friends from the ages of 11 to 13 in their adopted Amsterdam. &quot;If you are one of those millions who have read The Diary of Anne Frank,&quot; she writes in After Auschwitz, &quot;you may believe that you already know a lot about her. I did not know this Anne Frank, of course.&quot; The portrait she paints is of a precocious, self-confident girl, interested in boys, clothes, hairstyles and filmstars. Did she like her? &quot;Not particularly. I was a tomboy and she was so much more sophisticated. We simply didn&apos;t have the same interests.&quot; Then the war intervened and she and Anne never saw each other again. In 1942, her brother and father were ordered to report to a German &quot;work camp&quot;, forcing Eva and her mother to go into hiding. For two years, they lived in terror of being discovered. It was in May 1944, shortly after moving into their seventh hiding place in Holland, that a Dutch nurse betrayed them to the Gestapo. They were arrested, tortured and sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. &quot;Life was full of horror and fear,&quot; she writes in After Auschwitz. &quot;Imagine the hunger. Try to imagine the filth.&quot;     Eva Schloss with her mother, Fritzi, and older brother Heinz, who died in Auschwitz. Photograph: Copyright Eva Schloss Collection    Eight months later, with Germany facing defeat, they were released and began the long journey home. In June, the war over, they reached Amsterdam. They met Otto Frank again, whose own family had also been destroyed. United in mourning, Eva&apos;s mother and Otto then began a life together, working in tandem to bring Anne&apos;s diary to publication. &quot;My mother and Otto had a very happy marriage. They were inseparable and that was sometimes difficult for me,&quot; Eva says. &quot;I never got her to myself and couldn&apos;t understand, at first, how she could be so happy with someone who was not the father of her children. In many ways,&quot; she adds, &quot;I think I got over my suffering at Auschwitz pretty quickly. But the loss of my family members, I was never quite able to accept, then or now.&quot; She fell into a depression and at 16 became suicidal. Anne Frank&apos;s The Diary of a Young Girl became a global sensation and gradually a curious sort of notoriety attached itself to Eva. Naturally, she read it, but wasn&apos;t greatly impressed. &quot;I could see its appeal, though. In the 50s and 60s, people were starting to show interest in what had happened in the war, but didn&apos;t want to be reminded of the full horrors. Anne&apos;s book wasn&apos;t about the Holocaust at all. It was about hiding away. That was nothing new to me. I had hidden away in the war too before we were captured. But nobody wanted to hear my story.&quot; By the time her mother and Otto Frank were married, in 1953, Eva had moved to London. She wanted to be a photographer (she would later run an antiques shop), and it was here that she met her husband, Zvi Schloss, a German Jew whose family had escaped internment by fleeing to Palestine. In her new home, Eva was desperate to start a family and for a specific reason. When her brother Heinz was 12 he became terrified of dying. Their father explained that there was nothing to fear: when you have children, you live on through them. &quot;But what if we don&apos;t live to have children?&quot; he replied. Heinz died in Auschwitz. Getting pregnant for Eva, then, was imperative; she needed to honour his memory. &quot;But it was difficult. I still had mental and physical problems, and many difficulties conceiving.&quot; When at last she did, &quot;It brought me great happiness.&quot; Eva had three daughters, now in their 50s, and she has five grandchildren. Does she feel she made a good mother. &quot;That is actually a very sore point between my children and me,&quot; she answers. &quot;I think I did, yes, and I did everything I could for them. I loved them very much.&quot; But when, in a previous book, she wrote that she managed to have a normal life despite the horrors she had endured, her daughters questioned the veracity of this statement. Why? &quot;You know, I don&apos;t know. I must ask them. I don&apos;t know what I must have been lacking \u2026 But the pain [of Auschwitz] was with me still, obviously.&quot;     Otto Frank with Fritzi, and Eva's three daughters in Cornwall in 1965. Photograph: Copyright Eva Schloss Collection    The spectre of Anne Frank loomed large in her daughters&apos; upbringing as well. It was Otto Frank who introduced her diary to them, underlining not just how important it was, but its personal significance to them. They all read it, Eva says, &quot;but didn&apos;t talk to me about it so I never really knew how they felt&quot;. Did she ask? &quot;No.&quot; It&apos;s different with her grandchildren. She suggests that in many ways she has a better, or at least a less complicated, relationship with them than with her daughters. &quot;Maybe because there is a bigger distance. But they want to know, they want to talk to me about it. They are interested. One of my granddaughters \u2013 she is 18, and studying German \u2013 wants to go into my family background a lot. So we talk about it much more openly.&quot; Eva Schloss didn&apos;t choose this role \u2013 the books, the lectures, the talks she gives in schools for which she was awarded an MBE in 2012. Instead, the role was bequeathed to her \u2013 by her mother, and the man her mother married. &quot;I have two lives,&quot; she says. &quot;In one, I go out and travel the world and speak about Anne. This is not something I discuss at home.

Until then, shipbuilding had been primarily about steelworking skills. Offshore exploration required complex electrical systems and the yard had won a major contract. Peter asked what his new role entailed and was told: &quot;If it has got a wire in it, it&apos;s yours.&quot; The contract was for the Stena Seawell, the first in a series of vessels with electrical propulsion, computerised monitoring of machinery and high-voltage supply systems. Peter worked the huge crane ship ITM Challenger and the &quot;red fleet&quot; of 14 Superflex ferries, the last big order before the government&apos;s closure, announced in 1988, of NESL, which had been regarded as the most advanced shipbuilding outfit in the world. Born in Whitburn, near Sunderland, Peter started work as a technical apprentice or &quot;can boy&quot; at Sunderland Forge and Engineering. As the company diversified from supplying local shipyards, he worked as a contract engineer on the Thames Barrier and on projects for the burgeoning shipbuilding industries in Taiwan and Korea. He joined Terasaki UK on Clydeside in 1993 as engineering manager. For the next 20 years, he developed and patented new products, relishing the contact his work brought with the marine industry all over the world. His work often took him to Terasaki&apos;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan. Peter became well known for his presentations and had been due to give a keynote lecture for Lloyd&apos;s Register in Amsterdam. He believed a return to manufacturing and engineering skills was vital to Britain&apos;s future. He is survived by his wife, Avril, whom he married in 1968, his sons, Barry and Simon, and his grandchildren, Oliver and Rose.", "sentences": ["Peter became well known for his presentations and had been due to give a keynote lecture for Lloyd&apos;s Register in Amsterdam."], "title": "Peter Anderson obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/apr/09/peter-anderson-obituary", "tags": []}, {"publicationDate": "2013-04-11T15:51:03Z", "article": "The Yeah Yeah Yeahs became the latest musicians to speak out against camera-wielding concert attendees on Sunday night, when they played Webster Hall in New York City.

Sitting in the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam waiting for its resident orchestra to start a concert when you have never experienced the hall&apos;s astonishing acoustics before is a dream come true for any epicure of orchestral music. After all, it wasn&apos;t so long ago that the Concertgebouw Orchestra (the symbiosis of the orchestra and the hall is suggested by their shared name: both came into being 125 years ago today - 11 April 1888) was voted the world&apos;s best by Gramophone Magazine&apos;s panel of critics. Just being in the place where Gustav Mahler enjoyed some of his greatest successes as conductor and composer is a music-historical thrill. But none of that prepares you for the sonic shock of what the hall really sounds like. The first concert I heard there included Debussy&apos;s La Mer, conducted by Mariss Jansons (astonishingly, Jansons is only the sixth Chief Conductor in the Concertgebouw Orchestra&apos;s history; the second, Wilhlem Mengelberg, was in place for half a century, from 1895-1945). I&apos;ve never heard a performance in which the colours of textures of Debussy&apos;s marine onomatopoeia sounded so thrilling, in which the mere sound of a gong or a celesta was transfigured into musical poetry simply by being played in that space by those musicians. Every sound the orchestra made, from the double-basses to the percussion, was perfectly mixed and blended by the acoustic of the hall before it reached my ears with a velvety sensuality.     Mariss Jansons, chief conductor of theRoyal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Photograph: Marco Borggreve /Free PR Handout    It&apos;s tempting to be jealous of the Concertgebouw players. After all, which orchestra wouldn&apos;t sound magnificent in their hall? And when you&apos;ve a turnover of conductors and players that&apos;s a glacial as it is in the Concertgebouw (as one of the musicians said to me as we passed a panel with a long list of the names of the Concertgebouw players who had been there for more than 25 years, &quot;once you get a job with an orchestra like this, you tend not to leave&quot;), there is a guaranteed musical and cultural continuity. That&apos;s the reason the Concertgebouw Orchestra is capable of the minor miracle of making every hall they play in around the world sound just a little like their home turn: even in London&apos;s Barbican Centre, a world away from the Concertgebouw, they make their sound sing and soar. But all is not as it seems. That much-vaunted acoustic in Amsterdam is actually a bit of a nightmare for the players. Seriously. When they&apos;re on stage, the musicians can&apos;t actually hear one another properly. At the geographical extremes of the orchestra, if you&apos;re trying to co-ordinate, say, the double-basses over at the right-hand side with the horns on the left, you can&apos;t rely on your ears. The players know that if they wait to hear their colleagues over at the other extreme of the ensemble, they will be too late, so they have to compensate by playing what they think is a fraction early. Something weird happens in this supposedly perfect place for orchestral music: to the players on stage, their playing doesn&apos;t sound nearly as perfect as it does to the audience. As Dominic Seldis, the Concertgebouw&apos;s principal bass, told me: &quot;Even the greatest diamond needs polishing. And it&apos;s true that it&apos;s difficult to hear on stage here, but the hall corrects itself. If you sit in the audience, what you hear is a warm glow of sound. On the stage, the music might not sound together, but when it&apos;s projected out to the audience, it works.&quot; That means the Concertgebouw players are really masters of an orchestral illusion, because they are continually trying to transcend the limitations of the hall&apos;s on-stage sound when they play. In fact, the world-conquering warmth of the orchestra&apos;s sound is a direct result of their sonic battle with the acoustics of the hall: that tension produces the uniquely Concertgebouw combination of musical alertness - which the players need to co-ordinate their ensemble - and the sensual halo that&apos;s made by a slight inexactitude between the sections of the orchestra.     Exterior shot of Amsterdam's Concertgebouw Photograph: Leander Lammertink    Dominic Seldis again: &quot;when you have ten violinists, all with a slightly different tempo in their brain, but they&apos;re approaching the emotional and expressive qualities of a phrase with the same intensity \u2013 well, it&apos;s an amazing sound \u2026 If you&apos;re of the mindset that everything has to be right [or exactly in tempo, like a robotic click-track], this isn&apos;t the band for you.&quot; So here&apos;s a quick celebratory revelation of the Mahler interpretations of Mengelberg, van Beinum, Haitinik, Chailly, and Jansons, performances that are some of the bedrocks of the Concertgebouw&apos;s success. As you&apos;ll hear, it&apos;s a story of sonic continuity but creative flux in the vastly different approaches to the composer from each of the orchestra&apos;s chief conductors. That&apos;s just tip of the iceberg, of course; to really get stuck into the Concertgebouw&apos;s story, you&apos;ll need these volumes of their recorded history. But by way of a Mahlerian amouse-bouche: here&apos;s Mengelberg&apos;s Dionysian Mahler 4, van Beinum&apos;s classicism in the same symphony, Haitink&apos;s combination of the visionary and the structural, also in the 4th, the clarity and wildness of Chailly&apos;s 7th, and the sheer epic intensity of Jansons&apos;s 2nd.

Victory over Manchester City at Wembley , combined with success over two legs against Basel in the semi-final of the Europa League, would potentially see Chelsea confront Manchester United, Tottenham and Aston Villa in the week leading up to the FA Cup final. The Europa League final in Amsterdam, against Fenerbahce or Benfica, would be played the following Wednesday by which time Chelsea&apos;s season could be swollen to 70 matches. That has left Ben\u00edtez forced to pursue a pragmatic selection process to steer a relatively fragile squad through the clutter as he seeks to ensure his seven-month spell at the club yields at least one trophy and Champions League qualification. &quot;We know the fixtures we have, the schedule, and we&apos;ll try to put a very good team out in every competition,&quot; said the Spaniard. &quot;We also know that finishing in the top four is really important for the club and we will try to do that. &quot;But no one is going to play a semi-final saying they don&apos;t want to win. We just have to find a way of managing the squad, so we are strong against Manchester City but also against Fulham and Liverpool. We have to change players. You cannot come back from Moscow, after a game on a synthetic pitch, and keep the same players in the team. But I also know that, on our day, we can beat anyone.&quot; Ben\u00edtez is expected to omit John Terry and Frank Lampard from his starting XI at Wembley \u2013 the veterans both featured against Rubin Kazan in Moscow on Thursday \u2013 but may retain the in-form Fernando Torres up front, utilising Demba Ba against Fulham on Wednesday and the Spaniard at his former club, Liverpool, next Sunday. Ryan Bertrand has recovered from illness and will start at left-back, though the decision not to add further to the playing staff or recall players from loan spells in January has left the manager&apos;s options threadbare. The team&apos;s redevelopment, most likely without Lampard and possibly even Terry, will continue in the summer once Ben\u00edtez has gone but the Spaniard is confident the squad that remain at the club will have benefited from his time in charge and, with further investment, can challenge for the title next term. &quot;The new manager will have a good team,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;ll be happy. The balance of the side is better, there is a good group of players here. All I ever said was I wanted to do my best until the end of the season \u2013 I cannot change the situation \u2013 but the new manager will have a good team and will enjoy what is here. We will leave good players with more experience. I cannot take credit for signing these players because they were already here. Some of them are very good players but some of them are young and they&apos;ll be much better at the end of the season. &quot;They are learning every day and, I&apos;m sure, next year these players will be much better. They&apos;ll have more experience, will have settled down in England. They&apos;ve been growing, improving and learning. &quot;A lack of experience has cost us points in some games this season, and even maybe some trophies, but you can see them growing.

The church, founded in 1213, is the city&apos;s oldest building, a stripped back Calvinist beauty with pearly light pouring through its tall windows, over its gilded carvings and across its stone flagged floors. It is the kind of serene interior captured in the luminous oils of the Dutch Masters. Outside, the activities are rather less sacred. The Oude Kerk is at the centre of Europe&apos;s largest red-light district \u2013 the Wallen \u2013 and is ringed by hot-pink shopfronts where sex workers tap the windows to attract any likely passing trade. Opposite the church door is one of dozens of cannabis caf\u00e9s where you can spark up a joint of Lemon Haze and waste the day away. For decades, such scenes have been regarded as examples of civilised Dutch tolerance \u2013 a\u00a0&quot;whatever blows your hair back&quot; attitude \u2013 but Amsterdam has had enough. The municipality says its tolerance is being abused as the centre is being overwhelmed by tawdry sex shows, drug dealing and British stag-party weekenders. Organised crime has moved in and many businesses are fronts for money-laundering and human trafficking. So the city is rebranding itself, and has invested upwards of \u20ac700m on remaking its cultural institutions over the past decade. The Van Gogh museum has been renovated and reopens in May, the National Maritime Museum has been made ship-shape and the new EYE Film Institute Netherlands has opened in a futuristic building in the Overhoeks neighbourhood. The Stedelijk Museum of contemporary art, meanwhile, has been treated to a\u00a0bath-like extension the size of a\u00a0city block.     'The EYE Film Institute Netherlands has opened in a futuristic building': Amsterdam's answer to London's National Film Theatre. Photograph: Henk Meijer /Alamy    Crowning these efforts, the Rijksmuseum \u2013 the Dutch answer to the Louvre \u2013 reopened to the public this weekend after a decade-long closure. Under a \u20ac375m rebuilding project led by the Spanish architects Cruz y Ortiz, the museum&apos;s two halves have been united by an undercroft that joins its two courtyards. The remodelling has been so extensive that only Rembrandt&apos;s Night Watch remains in its original location among 8,000 objects in its 80 rooms. The central Gallery of Honour, containing works by Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch, has had a century of whitewash removed and its original late 19th-century frescos restored and reinstated. Elsewhere, canvases are displayed alongside furniture of the same period, white-marble busts illuminated dramatically against dark charcoal walls. In the special collections section, small items have been gathered to form art installations \u2013 a wall of intricate metal keys, for example, is displayed opposite a\u00a0vitrine full of locked boxes; an entire fleet of miniature wooden ships sails alongside a row of model lighthouses. Meanwhile Project 1012, named after the red-light district&apos;s postcode, aims to clean up the neighbourhood. The initiative began in 2007 and plans the closure of 200 out of 480 window brothels, and 26 out of 76 cannabis coffee houses; there are also plans to turn the sleazy Damrak \u2013 the main street into town from Centraal railway station \u2013 into a &quot;red carpet&quot; of welcome to the city, with &quot;upmarket shopping, fashion and cuisine&quot;. Right-wing politicians called for tourists to be banned entirely from the coffee shops, a\u00a0step too far for the municipality of Amsterdam, which has just won an exemption to the weed law. But it has negotiated a \u20ac25m deal to buy 18 brothels and gambling dens from their owners and put them to new uses, following the 2008 experiments Red Light Fashion and Red Light Design in which young Dutch designers were allowed to live and work rent free for a year in former brothels and use their windows for showcases. Since then, a former gambling house has been transformed into the Mata Hari bar, and a micro-brewery, deli, florist and homewares stores have also opened nearby. The poster project for Project 1012 is Anna, a fine-dining restaurant carved out of an old gallery and printworks by former club owner Michiel Kleiss. &quot;You don&apos;t need much critical mass around here,&quot; Kleiss tells me. &quot;If you are doing something classy, it immediately works.&quot; The Oude Kerk has been known as Amsterdam&apos;s living room throughout its history, and these days it is also used as a concert hall and exhibition space as part of its restoration. Across the square, Orpheu de Jong runs Red Light Radio and has a recording studio in the window. A few doors down his sister Afaina, a former architect, has opened the Ultra de la\u00a0Rue gallery. Both were brought up only a few minutes from the red-light district but say they didn&apos;t set foot in it until they were adults. &quot;It&apos;s a good thing for the area,&quot; says Afaina, but both she and Orpheu are wary of the area losing its edge entirely. Stand in front of the Rijksmuseum&apos;s charcoal-painted walls and look again at those Golden Age pictures of church interiors and you will find depictions of dogs cavorting, gallants chatting up maids and market stalls trading within the house of God.

Alas, in comments left in the Anne Frank House guest book, he opened himself up to ridicule and online anger. &quot;Truly inspiring to be able to come here,&quot; he offered. So far, so acceptable. Then came the hand-slap-forehead moment: &quot;Anne was a great girl.

Demba Ba sparked it all by spinning from Matija Nastasic and volleying with an outstretched boot as he tumbled to the turf to score the first goal conceded by Manchester City in this season&apos;s FA Cup and, for 24 frantic minutes, Chelsea tore into their opponents like a team possessed. Yet, by the time the final whistle strangled their hope for good, all that remained for those clad in black was a familiar sense of choking disappointment. The European champions have experienced it a few times during a season where, brutally speaking, they have regressed into nearly men. Back in August when these two sides collided at Villa Park, they had aspired to claim seven trophies and maintain all the momentum from Munich. One by one, those opportunities have slipped away. The Community Shield and European Super Cup were lost in August, the Champions League and, effectively, the Premier League in November, and the Fifa Club World Cup a month later. The Capital One Cup and now FA Cup have followed, with Chelsea left to pursue the one trophy they had not initially entered and, privately, must still curse they are in at all. The Europa League is all that remains in this campaign of transition. Hoisting a trophy in Amsterdam next month would still constitute a fine achievement, leaving them holders of both elite Uefa competitions simultaneously, for a few days at least. But they must overcome Basel in the semi-finals, a regular stumbling block, to have that chance. As Chelsea players stood hands on hips around the centre-circle and watched City celebrate with their supporters, the one consolation from this defeat \u2013 that their cluttered schedule over the season&apos;s final fortnight has now been eased somewhat with no return to Wembley inked into the diary \u2013 must have felt like no consolation at all. This game was still made by the holders&apos; barnstorming if unlikely recovery in those latter stages. For more than an hour Chelsea had appeared drained, outmuscled by powerful opponents doing to them what Roberto Di Matteo&apos;s charges had done to Tottenham Hotspur in the same fixture a year ago. Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Vincent Kompany were imposing, the 20-year-old Nastasic already a player of such stature in Serbia&apos;s side. Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Carlos Tevez had been a constant menace, with even Samir Nasri contributing to complement the trademark industry from James Milner and Gareth Barry. Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s side had gasped just to keep up, eclipsed by the Frenchman&apos;s opener and Ag\u00fcero&apos;s wonderfully looped header. In the circumstances, it seemed inconceivable that Chelsea might revive. This, after all, was a seventh game in 19 days, and a 59th of term. That is 15 more than City have had to endure. Break it down further and, over the past five weeks, City have played six times compared with Chelsea&apos;s 11, a schedule that took them to Moscow last week and Bucharest last month. If the interim manager has rotated and refreshed where he could, for all that the omission of Frank Lampard and John Terry here will have further infuriated the club&apos;s support, he can do little to combat mental fatigue. His defenders and defensive midfield rather froze at times when City buzzed into range, not least at Barry&apos;s delivery for Ag\u00fcero&apos;s goal. The lethargic start and sloppy concessions might be pinned to weary minds as much as energy-sapped limbs. That is the theory, anyway, though it was rather undermined by the revival. How could players apparently exhausted conjure such a finish? Kompany suggested complacency had seeped into City&apos;s approach, that it was all &quot;too comfortable&quot;, and the introduction of Fernando Torres, whose own confidence is soaring, clearly drove Ben\u00edtez&apos;s side on. But the manager was not clinging to fatigue as a factor. &quot;If you say it was then you cannot explain how we finished so strongly,&quot; he said. &quot;We had to show more character in possession, and we did that in the second half. But give credit to Manchester City, a very good team who are so strong, physically and technically, with players who can make the difference.&quot; That was a reminder of where Chelsea truly are. City have now overcome them three times this season and were the better team, too, in Ben\u00edtez&apos;s first game in charge despite the goalless scoreline that afternoon, a reflection of the fact these teams finished first and sixth in the Premier League last year and are seven points apart in this season&apos;s table. The current league champions are simply further along in their development as a squad. This has been a frantic and, as yet, fruitless campaign. But, while missing out on another showpiece will leave Chelsea smarting, it is more painful to acknowledge they are still seeking to catch City up.", "sentences": ["Hoisting a trophy in Amsterdam next month would still constitute a fine achievement, leaving them holders of both elite Uefa competitions simultaneously, for a few days at least."], "title": "Chelsea left playing catch-up as Manchester City superiority tells | Dominic Fifield", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/apr/14/chelsea-fa-cup", "tags": ["Chelsea", "FA Cup", "Manchester City", "Football", "Sport", "FA Cup 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-04-14T22:30:00Z", "article": "The rich and fulfilling conducting career of Sir Colin Davis, who has died aged 85, followed the path taken by so many romantic symphonies from Beethoven&apos;s Fifth onwards \u2013 from struggle to consolidation, crisis and an emphatic final victory. In his triumphant, but never placid, Indian summer, Davis continued above all to adorn his own monument as the unassailable leading interpreter of the 19th century&apos;s most individual composer, Hector Berlioz, frequently returning to other idols in a\u00a0broad if selective repertoire that ranged from Mozart to Tippett. The fifth of seven children, he was born in Weybridge, in the affluent stockbroker belt of Surrey. But his father was a bank clerk, and the only form of music in the family flat above a shop came from a gramophone which was the young Colin&apos;s solace and delight. In this way he experienced his road to Damascus with a performance of Beethoven&apos;s Eighth Symphony which alerted him to what he later called &quot;the power, the tenderness, the beauty, the ferocity of music&quot;. A wealthy great-uncle assisted him to a place at Christ&apos;s Hospital school, West Sussex, and there an older student encouraged him to take up the clarinet. Although his teachers tried to steer him towards a career in biology or chemistry, subjects in which he excelled, he was determined on a life in music. There were obstacles to his chosen sphere, conducting, since he had not learned the piano, and having gained a clarinet scholarship to the Royal College of Music, London, where he studied with Frederick Thurston, he found himself barred from conducting classes there. Another standard route to the podium, that of becoming a repetiteur with one of Germany&apos;s many opera companies, would also be closed to him; though looking back in 1991, he had no regrets about his lack of pianistic skill, declaring that &quot;conducting has more to do with singing and breathing than with piano-playing&quot;. In 1949, after military service, which he fulfilled as a clarinettist with the Household Cavalry, he married the soprano April Cantelo, soon to enjoy a distinguished career of her own, and conducted other graduates of the RCM in the newly formed Kalmar Orchestra, rehearsing in the basement of the Ethical Church in Bayswater. Out of the orchestra came the semi-professional Chelsea Opera Group, which invited him to conduct its performances of Mozart&apos;s Der Schauspieldirektor and Don Giovanni, an opera which was to remain a constant throughout his life. In Mozart, he later told the New York Times, he found &quot;all those things that helped keep me together \u2026 in Mozart you find a fantastic balance between the elements that make up music and make up a human being&quot;. His own life at this time, however, was far from balanced. He had part-time engagements as a clarinettist at Glyndebourne under Fritz Busch, then Mozart&apos;s greatest champion, and with the New London Chamber Orchestra. But even supplementary jobs conducting local choirs and coaching at Cambridge failed to bring in an income sufficient to support his wife, son and daughter. His first break came when he was offered the post of assistant conductor at the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in 1957, and two years later Mozart came to the rescue when Davis took over from an indisposed Otto Klemperer in a concert performance of Don Giovanni at the Royal Festival Hall. Sadler&apos;s Wells Opera, where he had conducted Mozart&apos;s Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail, had already offered him the post of chief conductor, and he became the company&apos;s music director in 1961. Stravinsky, his other great love of the late 1950s and early 60s, featured in memorable performances of Oedipus Rex and The Rake&apos;s Progress, and he faced the challenge of Beethoven&apos;s Fidelio for the first time. A personal crisis which precipitated the breakdown of his 15-year marriage, however, led to a request to be released from his five-year contract with the company. Other possibilities were in the air: influential voices canvassed for him to become the next principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra and music director of the Royal Opera House. Neither post was forthcoming; doubts were voiced about his stability, and many musicians found him, as he admits he then still was, &quot;a bit hard and tactless&quot;. Davis finally turned around his mid-life crisis with careful reading of Hermann Broch&apos;s Death of Virgil and Nikos Kazantzakis&apos;s The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel; the happiness of his marriage in 1964 to a Persian student, Ashraf Naini \u2013 his adored second wife, Shamsi; and appointment to the post of the BBC Symphony Orchestra&apos;s chief conductor in 1967, which he described as &quot;the completion of my education&quot;. From this point on there emerged a\u00a0new Colin Davis \u2013 less ambitious and self-indulgent, more ready to work with his orchestral musicians than to confront them. The BBC post allowed him to choose repertoire in co-operation with the supremely diplomatic controller of music, William Glock, and to venture into such complex new scores as Peter Maxwell Davies&apos;s Worldes Blis, which he looked back on as the most difficult work he had ever undertaken. He was less comfortable with the patriotic high jinks of the Last Night of the Proms, which he confessed gave off more than a whiff of the first world war antihero Earl Haig. His career had now taken a decidedly international turn, with chief conductorships in the offing from New York and Boston. He later took up the post of principal guest conductor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, recording his first and perhaps most keenly articulated Sibelius symphony-cycle there in the 1970s. Instead, he chose to succeed Georg Solti as music director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. He had already laid down a gauntlet with productions of Berlioz&apos;s Les Troyens (1969) and two Tippett operas \u2013 The Midsummer Marriage (1968) and the world premiere of The Knot Garden (1970). Outstanding recordings accompanied all three events, and the Tippett association continued with the heartfelt approval of the composer. Davis and Tippett shared an intellectual curiosity stretching way beyond the bounds of the musical world, and Tippett told Alan Blyth in 1972 that: &quot;Colin has an instinctive understanding of what I want without our ever having discussed it. I just feel that as far as interpreting my music is concerned, he&apos;s the tops.&quot; His relationship with the Royal Opera, perhaps inevitably given the countless sensibilities involved, proved less adulatory in the long term. The introspective Davis was perceived as much less of a theatrical animal than his predecessor, Solti; despite successful advances in his own repertoire and his insistence on sharing seasons with other top international interpreters \u2013 among them Claudio Abbado, Carlos Kleiber, Riccardo Muti, Zubin Mehta, Loren Maazel, Bernard Haitink and Gennadi Rozhdestvensky \u2013 he was still more revered abroad, especially in Amsterdam with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, than at home. Friction with the board of directors, responsibility for four unsuccessful new operas and controversial decisions over productions, not least G\u00f6tz Friedrich&apos;s staging of Wagner&apos;s Ring cycle, which he conducted and eloquently defended throughout the 1970s, contributed to a departure earlier than he would have liked, in 1986, after a 15-year reign that would have been more than enough for many other conductors. Now Sir Colin \u2013 he was knighted in 1980, appointed Companion of Honour in 2002 and awarded the Queen&apos;s Medal for music in 2009 \u2013 he continued to live an unostentatious private life divided between his homes in Highbury, north London, and Suffolk, devoted to his wife, the three sons and two daughters by his second marriage and a pet iguana that would terrorise visiting colleagues by landing on them unpredictably. The world was more than ever at his fingertips. A fruitful reign, from 1983, at the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, which understood his increasingly mellow and expansive manner perfectly, was followed by a principal guest conductorship with one of the most aristocratic of European orchestras, the Dresden Staatskapelle, in 1990. Yet a new golden age, with never a harsh word between conductor and players, truly began five years later when he accepted the post he had failed to reach back in 1964 \u2013 principal conductor of the LSO. Critics and public were unanimous in acclaiming him the finest interpreter of Berlioz of the age; concert performances of the operas and the pick of the major orchestral works and dramatic cantatas were mostly recorded for posterity (though not the first, ideally cast Barbican Benvenuto Cellini, perhaps the gem of the entire series). While his Bruckner, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Elgar symphonies were now magisterial, offering plenty of vitality within broad lines, Davis&apos;s plushly upholstered Sibelius stood in marked contrast to the more volatile, plainer-speaking interpretations of younger conductors. He discovered for himself a British composer whose white-heat inspirations suited him as well as Tippett had done, James MacMillan, and one of his last major undertakings with the LSO was a cycle of Nielsen&apos;s symphonies. Berlioz&apos;s Requiem was the last work he conducted with the LSO, in June last year. Davis&apos;s commitment to education and fostering the talents of the younger generation was embodied in his 25 years as international chair of orchestral studies at the Royal Academy of Music, which ran parallel to a similar role in Dresden&apos;s Music Conservatory. During his time at the academy, he was equally involved in opera productions, concerts, chamber music and masterclasses.To the last, he was certain of the repertoire that suited him best; the Russians, he declared, smacked too much of the circus, and most of Mahler&apos;s symphonies struck him as overwrought. Not everything he had once conducted with such vivacity aged well; his later Mozart and Richard Strauss at the Royal Opera could feel rather grandiose, in marked contrast to glorious concert performances with the LSO of three long-term favourites, Britten&apos;s Peter Grimes and Verdi&apos;s Falstaff and Otello. Mozart continued to be of the essence: when his wife died in 2010, he carried on with his commitment to a run of performances of Le Nozze di Figaro at the Royal Opera House. &quot;How did he do it?&quot;, asked Guardian critic Tom Service. The answer was simple: the strength comes from the music, and Mozart is &quot;life itself&quot;. Davis always remained true to a credo of humility, dating back to the turning-point of the mid-1960s, and revering that &quot;something in the air&quot; which was the essence of music. As he put it so eloquently to the writer Helena Matheopoulos: &quot;If people are musical and want to play, they will share this thing with you. I don&apos;t know why or how it happens.&quot; Davis is survived by his children. \u2022 Colin Rex Davis, conductor, born 25 September 1927; died 14 April 2013", "sentences": ["The introspective Davis was perceived as much less of a theatrical animal than his predecessor, Solti; despite successful advances in his own repertoire and his insistence on sharing seasons with other top international interpreters \u2013 among them Claudio Abbado, Carlos Kleiber, Riccardo Muti, Zubin Mehta, Loren Maazel, Bernard Haitink and Gennadi Rozhdestvensky \u2013 he was still more revered abroad, especially in Amsterdam with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, than at home."], "title": "Sir Colin Davis obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/14/sir-colin-davis-obituary", "tags": ["Colin Davis", "Classical music", "Opera", "London Symphony Orchestra", "Concertgebouw Orchestra", "Dresden Staatskapelle", "BBC Symphony Orchestra", "Royal Opera House", "Music", "UK news", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-04-15T07:00:01Z", "article": "So, after 10 long years, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has reopened \u2013 and what a wondrous sight it must be.

In the meantime, though, or perhaps as a primer ahead of a trip, why not try the marvellous \u2013 the utterly fantastic \u2013 new graphic biography of Rembrandt by the Dutch cartoonist Typex (the pseudonym of Raymond Koot). Commissioned by the Rijksmuseum, Rembrandt is published in the UK by SelfMadeHero, and it&apos;s a great fit for them, slipping in neatly among their graphic lives of, among others, Kiki de Montparnasse, Hunter S Thompson and Johnny Cash. Rembrandt was born in Leiden in 1606, and he led a rackety kind of life, mostly as a result of his own compulsive spending. His wife, Saskia, lost three children early on, and died herself in 1642, a year after she had their son, Titus. After this, Rembrandt fell first for his baby&apos;s nurse, Geertje Dircx, and then for a servant, Hendrickje Stoffels, at which point Geertje took him to court for breach of promise, on the grounds that he had promised to marry her. Rembrandt retaliated by accusing her of pawning some of Saskia&apos;s jewellery, and later got her sent to a house of correction. Afterwards, he and Hendrickje lived happily together, though he couldn&apos;t afford to marry her; Saskia&apos;s will dictated that his share of her family fortune would be lost if he were ever to remarry. In 1656 he was forced to apply for bankruptcy, and his collection of paintings were sold off for a pittance. The story goes that he was so hard up he even sold Saskia&apos;s grave. Nevertheless, he continued to shop, even trying to buy himself a Holbein, as you do. He died in 1669. Typex covers all this ground, but episodically; like any good biographer, he understands that his subject&apos;s life turned on certain moments, and he has made these his focus. The atmosphere of the book is wonderful, Typex having captured both Rembrandt&apos;s vast appetites and the puritanism of the day \u2013 the one, you sense, endlessly feeding the other. The drawings are fantastic: they teem with life (and, sometimes, with rats). Typex, like Rembrandt, is good at faces, and the doughier the better; almost everyone in this book looks like a potato. It feels outrageous to write it but I think Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn would have adored this book. He would have admired its draughtsmanship and its wit and \u2013 given how many times he painted himself \u2013 he would have loved the fact that he is its star, warts and all.

Let&apos;s look at this in some more detail. The story of Anne Frank is a solemn and sobering one, for sure. Her diary, which she called Kitty, simply and poignantly documents a period of almost unutterable darkness, made all the more terrible when one considers the age of the writer; a 13-year-old girl, at the beginning of what should have been a happy, carefree period. But even in the surrounding horror that marked their time in those cramped quarters, Anne found the time and headspace to write about her crush on a boy, a boy she dreamed about. Anne wrote of Peter Schiff (sometimes nicknamed &quot;Petel&quot; in her journal): &quot;All day long I&apos;ve been repeating to myself, &apos;Oh Petel, my darling, darling Petel&apos; and &apos;Where can I find help?&apos; I simply have to go on living and praying to God that, if we ever get out of here, Peter&apos;s path will cross mine. Once, when father and I were talking about sex, he said I was too young to understand that kind of desire. But I thought I did understand it, and now I&apos;m sure I do. Nothing is as dear to me now as my darling Petel!&quot; Teenagers have changed a hell of a lot in the past 70 years, but some things stay the same: attraction to other young, beautiful people. Bieber, who started his career as a swoop-haired poppet of 13, sings almost exclusively of these feelings. And relatively smart, engaged, 13-year-old girls from around the world love him for it. Is it outside of the realms of time-travelling possibility that Anne Frank \u2013 a smart, inquisitive, ultimately tragic historical figure and, crucially, young \u2013 would have enjoyed the musical and sartorial stylings of Justin Bieber? I shouldn&apos;t have thought so. Was Bieber&apos;s note at the very least, somewhat inappropriate? Maybe. Could he have written a more grave response, something more in keeping with the seriousness of Anne&apos;s fate? Possibly. Was there an adult who could have foreseen the likely backlash such a comment would receive? Undoubtedly (his manager, Scooter Braun, is Jewish). Should you, a megastar, have to be told to be a little thoughtful in your comments, because the world is watching? But Bieber is a teenage pop star, who has lived in a bubble of entitlement since he became a teenager. Moreover, he&apos;s hardly an intellectual heavyweight, filling lulls in his stadium performances with readings from Primo Levi or bell hooks. Remember when he was 16, and Rolling Stone asked him about abortion? His reply: &quot;I really don&apos;t believe in abortion. It&apos;s like killing a baby.&quot; How about in the case of a rape resulting in pregnancy? &quot;Well, I think that&apos;s really sad, but everything happens for a reason. I guess I haven&apos;t been in that position, so I wouldn&apos;t be able to judge that.&quot; Yes, 16 is a long way away from 19, but I guess that amounts to three weeks in celeb-land? Is he too old to be this stupid and insensitive? No doubt. But this is not nearly as bad as some people are making it out to be. I imagine most 19-year-olds would produce surprisingly stupid comments on a daily basis, they&apos;re just not recording them in museum guestbooks. &quot;I&apos;m young and I make mistakes,&quot; Bieber told US Weekly last month.

We have lost one of our greatest British conductors. I worked with him on three Mozart operas: The Marriage of Figaro and The Magic Flute at the Royal Opera House, and La Clemenza di Tito at the Aix-en-Provence festival. It was such a learning curve doing Mozart with him \u2013 he brought so much love to the music, but he was never interested in following fashions, he wanted to find his own way.            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view video His approach was predicated purely on an innate and instinctive understanding of the music, and the depth of both his knowledge and empathy was extraordinary. He didn&apos;t tend to say much in rehearsals. He&apos;d smile benignly, mostly, and just watch intently. But he certainly knew what he wanted, and if he didn&apos;t like something he&apos;d pipe up, expressing himself in terms that you simply couldn&apos;t argue with \u2013 they made so much sense. Instead of micromanaging the singers, he collaborated with them, letting them sing, while with his orchestra he was a fantastic technician. He had that wonderful talent of knowing how to watch and accompany. Few conductors have that ability. Josephine Barstow, soprano I worked with Colin over many years, beginning, I think, in the late 1960s in Peter Grimes at Covent Garden, where I sung second niece. And then there was Michael Tippett&apos;s The Knot Garden in 1970. I was extremely young, and the thing I remember most is how kind he was. I hadn&apos;t done a lot of modern music and it wasn&apos;t an easy score to sing, but he was always encouraging. He had a lovely relationship with Tippett: there was a great deal of mutual respect, and you always felt with him conducting that you were safe, it was going to be OK. He got the best out of people by understanding that he was heading a team and making music with us all; he made us feel that our own input was important. He didn&apos;t go from place to place saying: &quot;This is how I do things.&quot; He understood that if he was working with a different team, the end result would be different; he wanted to find the best performance for whatever cast he was working with. I can remember in Peter Grimes him saying, &quot;I don&apos;t want to drive this, I want you all to take hold of the piece.&quot; One particular memory I have is from about 25 years later, when I stepped in at short notice to sing in Fidelio at Covent Garden. I took the wrong turning in the aria . Moments like these are disasters: you don&apos;t know how to get back, and a lot of conductors would slay you, treat you as if you were an idiot, or had done it on purpose. But I remember he came to my dressing room in the interval, sat down next to me, and just said: &quot;Bad luck.&quot; It was so heartwarming. I&apos;ve never forgotten it. Robin Ticciati, conductor It feels like he will always be my musical father. That&apos;s a privilege and an honour. It was his performance of Sibelius&apos;s First Symphony when I was playing for him in the National Youth Orchestra that made me want to become a conductor: that experience was just the most incredible musical and emotional journey. Since then, he has guided me with unbelievable generosity. As a mentor, he never forced me into anything. Instead, he waited to see what decisions I would make on my own, and then would beckon me back into his wisdom and teach me from it. What was so inspiring was his responsibility in front of the score, and how he brought everything in his life and his art to those notes in front of him: King Lear, bolognese, love. There was a symbiosis between how he lived for the world, for people, and for music. I just feel\u00a0so grateful for those hours in his garden or sat on his sofa, to have had that time with him. What he taught me was to have one thousand per cent conviction in your thoughts about any piece of music \u2013 to know every alleyway and wooded grove of the score. And yet when you get up in\u00a0front of the orchestra, you have to embrace the sound of the musicians and trust them. I know he wasn&apos;t a man for expressing love on an immense scale, but having known him since I was 13, I hope he knew that I loved him. His teaching and his wisdom will never leave me: that essential idea that the score must be a journey. And if that&apos;s true, you can hope to say something with the piece that might make some reverberations in the world, to make it a more vibrant and more beautiful place.            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view video Nikolaj Znaider, violinist and conductor What was so extraordinary was his combination of humility, integrity and generosity. I just don&apos;t see that anywhere else in our world: too often, it&apos;s about the overblown maestro ego and not about the music itself. That was how he saw the world: he told me, as he told many other people, that all we have to do as musicians, as conductors, is just not get in the way of\u00a0the music. All we have to do is let Mozart, say, do his job. It sounds banal \u2013 and of course it&apos;s an over-simplification \u2013 but on a deep and almost zen level, it&apos;s an incredibly profound idea. Once you&apos;ve learned everything, as he had, you just have to let it happen. And that&apos;s what happened when we worked together. He made all of us on stage \u2013 the soloist, each musician in the orchestra \u2013 the best version of ourselves that we could be. That&apos;s the best compliment I could pay to anyone. There was an eloquence in his gestures that was just as beautiful as the way he spoke. He was able to encapsulate the essence of a musical phrase in a single gesture. I remember watching him rehearse La Clemenza di Tito with the LSO at Aix-en-Provence, and there were these three notes at the end of a particular phrase: he gave three little kisses to the woodwind players to describe what he wanted. And every time I saw those performances, I saw those three little kisses. He was able to make these little miracles with absolute effortlessness. Meirion Bowen, musician and\u00a0writer Colin was largely responsible for the revaluation of Michael Tippett&apos;s music from the 1960s onwards. He attended an early performance of his oratorio A Child of Our Time in the 1940s and was immediately ensnared. He subsequently conducted many performances of the work, recorded it and went on to conduct premieres of major Tippett compositions. Some of Tippett&apos;s works had been coarsely dismissed by both conductors and orchestral players (I remember one player even trampling on a copy of his part after a rehearsal), but Colin made this a thing of the past. He shared Tippett&apos;s wide interests in literature (especially German writers) and clearly perceived how this had given a depth to Tippett&apos;s compositions that went beyond purely technical facets. Tippett&apos;s contrapuntal textures and virtuosic instrumental writing demanded far more rehearsal than had been generally available in the 1940s and 50s. But when, for instance, Davis premiered Tippett&apos;s Third Symphony, he insisted on a number of extra strings-only rehearsals to ensure that all problems of execution were sorted out. The results were illuminating. And in Tippett&apos;s epic, full-evening, choral and orchestral composition, The Mask of Time, Davis was equal to all its musical and intellectual demands. He set an example that others subsequently followed, causing an escalation in the composer&apos;s reputation worldwide. While both conductor and composer were both deeply serious about their work, they shared a huge sense of humour. I recall Colin, at a meal with soloists and others, after a major Tippett performance, mischievously ejecting bits of food off a fork at others around the table. He was devoted to his wife Shamsi, who was both loving and strong, and her death in 2010 left him totally despondent and isolated, unwilling to accept any more conducting engagements, despite innumerable pleas. I remember one night after [Tippett&apos;s] The Mask of Time at the Royal Albert Hall, Colin was backstage, and had started to change out of his formal clothes, and was sitting exhausted at a table with a hard drink. Shamsi came rushing in and ordered him to put his trousers back on, as the Prince of Wales was about to enter the room. Reluctantly, he complied. The Prince arrived and uttered a single word: &quot;Gosh!&quot; John Tooley, general adminstrator (then director), Royal Opera House, 1970-1988 The 15 years that Colin and I shared at Covent Garden were a wonderful time. True, it was difficult at the beginning, but that&apos;s been the same with other music directors. And that difficulty wasn&apos;t because of Colin being awkward; it was because he couldn&apos;t really come to terms with authority. All that he was interested in was making music \u2013 his humility put him at a huge disadvantage when it came to things like the board. He showed incredible flair for Mozart\u00a0and Berlioz, which was well known before he arrived. But he developed as a musician through all the\u00a0repertoire he conducted: the Ring\u00a0Cycle, which I thought he led marvellously well, even if there were lapses (but let&apos;s face it, there are always lapses in a Ring); in French repertoire, such as Werther or Samson and Delilah; and of course in Tippett. He had an absolute sense of what Tippett was about, even if he didn&apos;t always understand his texts (mind you, none of us did) \u2013 but Colin made Tippett&apos;s operas work superbly. Colin&apos;s life was a continual search, and he was always progressing, as a man and musician. In the early days when I went to see him at the interval, he would be reading a Yeats poem. He was extremely interested in literature. In recent years, he began to mellow and became an even more philosophical soul. And Shamsi [his second wife] was a power of strength for him \u2013 and they had a great collection of children to boot. They were inseparable, and when she died I thought that would be the end for Colin. But all credit to him, he began to find his way out of his grief, and find his way to conduct again. Theirs was one of the most remarkable relationships I have ever known. They were so supportive of each other. Kathryn McDowell, managing director, London Symphony Orchestra Sir Colin Davis assumed the role of president shortly after I joined the LSO, and it was a great joy to the orchestra and our audiences that he continued to forge ahead with major projects for another seven years. This Indian summer included revisiting some of the repertoire for which he was most renowned and rerecording it on LSO Live (Berlioz, Sibelius), but it also involved ambitious new projects, such as the complete symphonies of Nielsen, which he was conducting for the first time. He continued to have an appetite for commissioning new work, having been associated with major composers such as Michael Tippett in the past, and for his 80th birthday he agreed that the LSO should commission a full-length Easter Passion from James MacMillan, which he conducted in London, Amsterdam and Boston. He believed in commissioning major new work and wanted young composers to feel part of the LSO family, alongside young artists and young conductors. What mattered to Sir Colin was the music-making, the musicians and all those who loved music. This, together with his close-knit family, was the focus of his life. A deep humility dominated all his work at the LSO. Numerous young conductors will testify to Colin&apos;s huge influence on their development, yet he refuses all claims to have taught anyone. Sir Colin was also practical; after his 80th birthday, he asked me about the LSO&apos;s financial situation and offered a major gift of his own, only agreeing for it to be publicly known when he could see it would encourage others to follow suit. Today, the LSO and all those who worked with him or loved his performances feel a profound sense of loss, but we also feel deeply privileged to have known him. His many recordings are a fantastic legacy, but so, too, are the memories that so many people will cherish of his music-making in the concert hall, and his encouragement of young musicians. Andrew Davis, conductor He&apos;s one of our giants. We didn&apos;t see a lot of each other, but I remember vividly the first and last times we met. The first was in the conductor&apos;s room at the BBC&apos;s Maida Vale studios. I was just starting out and he was coming in after me and said \u2013 it was terribly Colin \u2013 &quot;We are legion&quot; (we&apos;re both Davises). I think he must have been reading a lot of William Blake at the time. And then I saw him in New York a few years ago, when he conducted the New York Philharmonic in a programme of Berlioz and Sibelius. He started with an inspirational performance of Berlioz&apos;s Les Francs-Juges overture \u2013 I had forgotten how wonderful that piece was and immediately started programming it. And he finished with the most incandescent, wonderful, astonishing performance of Sibelius&apos;s Seventh Symphony that I&apos;ve ever heard. We went for dinner afterwards and had the best time. There was absolutely no conductors&apos; bullshitting at all. I just regret that I didn&apos;t get to see him more. Lennox Mackenzie, chairman and sub-leader of the LSO He was a master conductor who possessed an innate understanding of great music that he performed with astonishing energy, care, warmth and affection. He had the gift of transferring his musical thoughts and ideas to us London Symphony Orchestra players in the most congenial and delightful manner, thereby creating the perfect atmosphere for enjoyable and first-rate music making. He cared deeply for the health and welfare of his musicians, always showing warmth and interest for our wellbeing; his love of the orchestra created a warm family atmosphere within. Music was his true love. He was ego-free and never a showman, and hated other people&apos;s self-aggrandisement \u2013 music came first for him. I remember a conducting masterclass when he berated one of the young conductors for working too hard \u2013 moving his arms\u00a0around too much. He took over, briefly, on the podium and set\u00a0the orchestra off in a movement of Beethoven. Then he stopped conducting completely, the orchestra carried on, and he explained to the young man, &quot;The orchestra is on a roll.\u00a0It&apos;s not going to stop. You don&apos;t have to do anything.&quot; But of course every now and again, Sir Colin would give a small gesture which would indicate a dynamic or a piece of expression that made the orchestra sound totally different. I realised at that point I was in the presence of greatness. His interpretations of Sibelius, Elgar and Mozart \u2013 to name but a few \u2013 are legendary, but it is Berlioz that I think of first. The last concert the orchestra played with him was his Grande Messe des Morts at St Paul&apos;s Cathedral. He brought structure, architecture and thrilling excitement to Berlioz&apos;s music. I&apos;m so glad to have that final concert as such a special memory. Clive Gillinson, executive and artistic director, Carnegie Hall, New York In the first part of his career, orchestra/conductor relationships were substantially defined by a battle for supremacy, apparently relished by some conductors, abhorred by Sir Colin. He always fought against the notion of power, seeing his job as being the convener of the exploration of the music, in partnership with the musicians of the orchestra. He often told me that his period as principal conductor was the highlight of his musical life, having at last found a partnership where he was free to be himself, working with a group of like-minded musicians, to endlessly explore the wonders of the music he adored. For all of us at the LSO at that time, it was a privilege to be his partner on this journey, at last pursued, as he had always dreamed, in a spirit of mutual trust and humility. Antonio Pappano, Music Director, The Royal Opera The warmth and excitement of his music-making will be terribly missed. We had future plans with him in place, but more importantly his passing represents the end of an era where grit, toil, vision and energy were the defining elements of a leading international opera house. This is a sad moment for British music.  Heather Harper, soprano Colin and I started at the Royal Opera House at almost the same time and worked together quite a lot. I remember singing Vitellia with him in La clemenza di Tito when very few people had heard the opera; later, we worked together most notably in Britten&apos;s music and also Tippett&apos;s. I remember the happy occasion when Elijah Moshinsky&apos;s production of Peter Grimes had its premiere in 1975; there was such a good atmosphere and he was so serene, although Colin could be very emotional. It was he who got me to almost shout the word &quot;answers&quot; in the recording of Tippett&apos;s Third Symphony. Christopher Maltman, baritone Great conductors don&apos;t simply keep orchestra and singers in time, they bind them together with an overarching artistic vision that imbues tempo with meaning and purpose, and mystically facilitate the sometimes convoluted process of lifting music from page to public. Sir Colin was a truly great conductor. Even more remarkably, he was one who managed his herculean tasks with profound integrity, humility, depth and class. I was fortunate enough to work with him on music ranging from Mozart to MacMillan, including both my Covent Garden debut and ROH&apos;s last incarnation of the eternal Zauberfl\u00f6te, and, although the sparkling, rejuvenating energy he brought to each, even into his 80s, may have now departed, all of those pieces will for me be haunted forever by his warm, benevolent spirit.

The zoo said that the &quot;love tunnel&quot; separating the neighbouring enclosures for the female giant panda, Tian Tian, and the male, Yang Guang, could be opened on Tuesday afternoon or during the night, to exploit their extremely tight 36-hour breeding season. The pair&apos;s keepers and panda experts from Germany and China believe Tian Tian will be at her most fertile early on Wednesday morning, when the pair would again be put in each other&apos;s enclosures being released to meet directly. Even if the zoo&apos;s efforts to coax the pair into a voluntary coupling succeed, biologists under the direction of a Chinese panda expert will try artificial insemination over Tuesday night or Wednesday to increase the chances of producing young. As well as having a remarkably short breeding season, which accounts in large part for their very low population numbers \u2013 it is believed there are only about 1,500 left in the wild in addition to the 350 in captivity \u2013 there is also a risk that consummation will fail to produce young. Tian Tian and Yang Guang \u2013 their names translate as Sweetie and Sunshine \u2013 have been under close scrutiny and supervision as their breeding season approaches. Tian Tian&apos;s sexual hormone levels have been measured daily to predict when they might peak. In a gesture of politeness, and to allow zoo staff to work without the world&apos;s prying eyes, the &quot;panda cam&quot; which beamed live images of their enclosures over the web was switched off several days ago. Iain Valentine, the zoo&apos;s director of giant pandas, said: &quot;The annual panda breeding season is imminent and the next 24 hours are critical. Tian Tian is not quite ready yet, however, her hormones could peak as soon as this afternoon, this evening, overnight or early tomorrow morning \u2013 we are now that close. Yang Guang is more than ready and is a completely different animal to this time last year.&quot; Valentine said the pair had been &quot;communicating heavily&quot; through a grate in a short tunnel which divides their enclosures inside a linking building; when they are sufficiently familiar with each other again, that gate will be opened. &quot;Last year we saw all the right signals at this stage \u2013 Tian Tian was calling out repeatedly to Yang Guang and both were heavily interested in each other,&quot; Valentine said. &quot;When the door opens the pair will probably wrestle once more to assess each other&apos;s strength, which is vitally important for animals of this size and power, and then things should progress from there.&quot; Valentine said Edinburgh&apos;s efforts were being supported by Prof Wang of the China Conservation and Research Centre for Giant Pandas in Wolong and specialists from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin. &quot;Artificial insemination will follow on from the natural mating attempts, whether they mate naturally or not. We have several world-leading experts on artificial insemination and reproduction management of endangered species on hand to assist RZSS [Royal Zoological Society of Scotland] specialists,&quot; he added. &quot;Two teams will work simultaneously with Tian Tian and Yang Guang in their indoor viewing areas, firstly to get a fresh semen sample from the male and then to artificially inseminate the female. &quot;The timing of procedure is critical. As soon as Tian Tian hits peak her hormones will start to fall and artificial insemination will probably take place very soon afterwards; this again could be as soon as this evening, overnight or tomorrow morning.&quot; The pair were loaned to the zoo for 10 years in a deal including a $1m (\u00a3653,000) per year fee to the Chinese, as a diplomatic gesture to cement the increasingly close economic ties between China, now the world&apos;s second largest economy, and Scotland. The pandas flew into Edinburgh in December 2011, several months after the loan deal was formally agreed in tandem with multimillion-pound investment agreements by Chinese companies in the Grangemouth oil refinery near the Scottish capital. Last year&apos;s first pairing failed, after the pandas&apos; increasingly amorous advances ended without any intercourse. A successful breeding of panda cubs would be immensely rewarding for the zoo; as the zoo&apos;s senior staff were in the latter stages of negotiating the loan, it emerged that in 2010 its owners, the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, needed a \u00a32m rescue loan after suffering a \u00a31.5m loss and a sharp fall in visitor numbers. Even one panda cub would be expected to draw large crowds, boosting the zoo&apos;s gate receipts and merchandising sales, and helping meet the significant costs of keeping the panda family. In addition to the \u00a3653,000-a-year loan payments, the zoo has to specially import bamboo by air from Amsterdam, while spending more on staff costs, equipping and maintaining the pandas&apos; \u00a3250,000 enclosures, and on a major panda-related marketing campaign.", "sentences": ["In addition to the \u00a3653,000-a-year loan payments, the zoo has to specially import bamboo by air from Amsterdam, while spending more on staff costs, equipping and maintaining the pandas&apos; \u00a3250,000 enclosures, and on a major panda-related marketing campaign."], "title": "Edinburgh zoo pandas 'ready to mate'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/16/edinburgh-zoo-pandas-ready-mate", "tags": ["Animals", "Scotland", "UK news", "Giant pandas"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-04-18T06:00:04Z", "article": "Live America&apos;s Cup World Series1pm, Sky Sports 3 Coverage of the final curtain-raiser event for this year&apos;s America&apos;s Cup challenge, which will be held off San Francisco from July.

The answer for Matt and Cassey Topham, a former decorator and supermarket worker from Nottingham who scooped the EuroMillions jackpot last year, is to erect a futuristic mansion on a suburban avenue with all the trappings of a James Bond villain&apos;s lair. The couple on Thursday submitted a planning application for a sinuous solar panel-clad home in Nottinghamshire which will be 16 times larger than the average three-bedroom family house. The project is likely to be one of the most ambitious new homes to be built in the UK \u2013 if planners grant consent. It will feature a garage screened by a waterfall, a botanical garden and a grotto swimming pool as well as eight bedrooms, all at a estimated cost of \u00a35m. Until recently, the Tophams lived in an \u00a390,000 ex-council house in Stapleford. Matt and Cassey, 24 and 23, have had their lives turned upside down by the huge win in February 2012 and are understood to have told the designers they wanted to create a private bolt hole away from unwanted attention.

There is also an underground garage for up to 10 cars to be glimpsed through a waterfall contrived from a pair of pools allowing water to tumble through the courtyard from one storey to the next. &quot;Must-haves included five bedrooms, a dramatic sweeping staircase, a large garage and a grotto-style pool,&quot; the couple said. &quot;We also spent a lot of time debating with the architect how the rooms would be used and the split between open plan and entertaining spaces versus cosy, snug rooms. We were very clear we didn&apos;t want to live in a glass box. At the very top of our wish list was a strong desire to keep the design contemporary yet familiar, and flexible enough to accommodate a future family.&quot; The Tophams are reported to have already paid off the mortgage of Matt&apos;s father and given \u00a31.3m to a close friend, as well as paying for holidays for friends and family in Spain, New York and Amsterdam.

Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA    The project involves demolishing a \u00a31.2m 1930s mansion they bought which overlooks a country park. They hired London-based Baca Architects, after seeing them present a seminar at a Grand Designs Live exhibition, a spin-off from the TV show in which Kevin McCloud looks on with a mixture of sympathy and disbelief as people struggle to build their dream homes. The Tophams were careful not to let on they were lottery winners and Richard Coutts, a Baca partner, admitted he was not sure they were serious at first. But the young firm, sensing a dream commission, grasped the opportunity. Early inspirations for the couple came from films such as Iron Man, with its underground car park, and TV series such as Dynasty for its staircase. As the design progressed the architects took them to Eltham Palace, a medieval royal palace with an art deco interior, to the Marni fashion store on Sloane Street, with its space-age staircase designed by Future Systems, and to the Victoria and Albert Museum to look at materials and furniture. Coutts said the house was organised into &quot;clusters of activity&quot;, like country house wings. &quot;Visitors arrive via a grand hall where a majestic staircase sweeps up to a cinema room and study, contained in two acoustically sealed pods hovering above a drawing room,&quot; he said. &quot;In the drawing room a large picture window, set on an axis with the neighbouring country park, offers views over the maze.&quot; Not all lottery winners have found moving a smooth process.

Planners in Norwich, meanwhile, will be scrutinising plans submitted earlier this year for a rain square and flood park that aims to create 670 homes and new public spaces on a flood-prone site at the juncture of the Wensum and Yare rivers. As long as we want to keep developing in low-lying areas, particularly around our tidal rivers and coasts, then creating whole settlements that rise and fall as the water ebbs and flows is a perfectly legitimate solution. The Dutch \u2013 the ultimate early adopters when it comes to water \u2013 already boast examples such as Amsterdam&apos;s pioneering Ijburg community. But for the majority of people living in urban centres, floating villages aren&apos;t the future. In fact, they often obscure what we really need to be focusing on when we think about the relationship between our cities and water. Those who visited Ecobuild this year had the opportunity to hear Professor Tony Wong, chief executive of the Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities, talking about the steady progression up the agenda of water sensitive urban design (WSUD) in Australia. Successive years of flooding and some of the worst droughts in recorded history \u2013 which have not only threatened the health and wellbeing of the population but very nearly brought industry grinding to a halt \u2013 have prompted the Australian government to think differently about water. The result has been a huge shift in mindset that has seen WSUD enshrined in planning and policy responses to climate change, and an acceptance that tackling flooding and drought doesn&apos;t have to be in isolation to creating liveable cities. A water feature in the heart of a city, for example, will enhance the micro-climate and reduce heat island effect, while whole productive landscapes can be supported by waste-water recycling. A new report, Water Sensitive Urban Design in the UK, published by the CIRIA in March, reinterprets the WSUD concept for the UK and its conclusions might best be summed up simply as: for too long, we have been designing water out of our cities when we should have been designing it in. The introduction to the report sets out the challenge we face: &quot;Water shortages, flooding and watercourse pollution are all signs of stress where developed areas have a troubled interaction with the natural water cycle and where, conversely, water has become a risk or a nuisance rather than an asset or an opportunity.&quot; The evidence has been stacking up for some time. Flooding in 2012 caused the biggest insurance industry losses since 2007, when 13 people were killed and more than \u00a33bn of water damage claims were filed. According to Defra, an estimated 5m properties in England alone are at risk of flooding \u2013 and their owners will be left even more vulnerable if the Association of British Insurers agreement to insure properties in high-risk areas is not renewed after July 2013. This isn&apos;t just about flooding either: 27% of water bodies in England do not meet European water quality standards, while 20 million customers in the UK experienced hosepipe bans in the 2012 to limit stress on water resources. A survey of built environment professionals conducted as part of the report showed that 83% of respondents believe water management is considered too late in the planning and design process of developments. We have to start prioritising all elements of the water cycle when designing and developing new places. We can start by looking beyond the idea that a pipe in the ground is the best option for getting rid of rainwater. This is a 19th-century solution that is neither the best nor only solution to a growing 21st-century problem. Instead, we need a better understanding of the economics that allow soft-planted or bio-engineered drainage schemes to cost less while enhancing land values. We already know, for example, that sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) \u2013 the creation of ponds, wetlands, swales and basins that mimic natural drainage \u2013 can be a cost-effective way to prevent surface flooding while creating valuable public amenities. But we need to go further than SuDS and start joining the dots between flood risk management and water resource management, and start putting water at the heart of discussions about what makes places great to live. This is what we mean when we talk about WSUD, a process of looking at how, for example, we could be holding on to more of our flood water for reuse in meeting demand for drinkable water, while at the same time taking the pressure off existing infrastructure by reducing the amount of water entering the sewers. And a fundamental part of a water sensitive city is that we integrate the design of those features into the fabric of our towns and cities as attractive livable landscapes. WSUD can be applied at all scales, from a single house to an entire city, and it can be retrofitted to existing developments as well as built in from the start. What we need are policies that see this thinking being adopted in every local plan and a commitment from the government to a comprehensive water management programme for the UK.

Together, they are the debut authors who set this week&apos;s London Book Fair on fire, each commanding huge sums from the publishers from around the world who were frantic to acquire their novels, and collectively reminding a book trade which spent this week debating how fast the literary world is changing that, just sometimes, it&apos;s still all about the stories. Matthew Thomas, 38, has decided to quit his job as a high school teacher in New York to focus on writing full time after a US publisher paid more than a million dollars for American rights in his debut We Are Not Ourselves, and a British press spent six figures to land the novel. Described as an &quot;Irish epic&quot; , it follows the story of Eileen, raised in 1940s Queens by an alcoholic mother and a union-employed father, as she grows up, marries, and early-onset Alzheimer&apos;s affects her family. &quot;I&apos;ve been working on this book in different forms for more years than I like to remember,&quot; says Thomas. &quot;I started in the writing seminars at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 2000, but I had been writing my way around this material before that, during my undergraduate years at Chicago, in workshops with the wonderful and recently deceased Richard Stern. I submitted short stories to workshop at Hopkins, and later at Irvine, and worked on We Are Not Ourselves on the side, until I finally submitted a portion of it in my last workshop at Irvine. &quot;Some of those stories inevitably provided material that I reshaped and worked into the novel, which is fortunate, because they didn&apos;t work as stories. I tried telling this book in all sorts of ways, from different points of view and in different voices, until I settled on a working method. It was a long road, and there were far more years when it wasn&apos;t working than when it was \u2013 when it was shaggy, messy, hopeless \u2013 but in the last four years or so things seemed to click and the writing came more easily. The book beat me up until I was sufficiently beaten, and then it sat me down and taught me how to write it.&quot; His agent, Bill Clegg, at WME, says he knew he had something outside the ordinary in his hands as soon as he began reading We Are Not Ourselves. &quot;In the opening pages I knew I would be reading every 700-plus pages of the manuscript. There was an authenticity to the voice and a command of language that was instantly apparent. I stayed up until 3.30 am finishing the novel and was devastated,&quot; he says. &quot;As tired as I was I began to read again from the beginning because I was not quite yet ready to let go of this family and the heart-breaking story Matthew tells. Soon after, once I had submitted to editors and publishers in New York and abroad, it was clear that I was not the only one to have had that experience. The book casts a powerful spell.&quot; Thomas is astonished at the attention his debut has received. &quot;[It] exceeds any hopes or expectations I might have had for it,&quot; he says. &quot;I wanted to write a book that conveyed ideas I had about the human condition, certainly, but at root what I wanted to do was make readers feel something \u2013 something genuine, though, not something unearned. Sentiment without sentimentality was always my goal.&quot; This week&apos;s London Book Fair also saw a host of other big-money deals but the debut novelists are the ones to have set international publishing buzzing. &quot;It has been refreshing and inspiring \u2026 to see there is genuine appetite for new voices in fiction,&quot; says Thomas&apos;s UK agent Elizabeth Sheinkman at WME. In the UK, 28-year-old Emma Healey is still reeling at how fast her world has changed. Her debut, Strange Companions, is currently the centre of a fierce auction in the UK, with nine publishers bidding to acquire it \u2013 she comes out of her open plan office at UEA to discuss how it feels. &quot;On Easter Monday I was still writing the book \u2013 now three weeks later there&apos;s all this interest. I&apos;m just completely stunned,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s fantastic \u2013 when you&apos;re writing a novel the thing you most want is to connect with other people, and especially with this, as it&apos;s such a personal book, inspired by my grandparents.&quot; Strange Companions is narrated by Maud, in the midst of fast-progressing dementia, who tries to find her best friend Elizabeth, leaving notes around the flat to remind her of her quest while failing to recognise her family and carers as her mind returns her to the 1940s. It is the first thing Healey has written. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;ve even written short stories before. It was just this story which kept nagging at me, and it felt like terrible training material because it&apos;s so complicated, I would tie myself up in knots. But I couldn&apos;t concentrate on anything else,&quot; she says. Karolina Sutton at Curtis Brown, her agent, met Healey after she did a talk at the UEA creative writing course. &quot;She submitted her novel to me and I read it overnight,&quot; said Sutton. &quot;[It&apos;s] gripping, moving and at times funny. It illuminates the mystery of memory and identity. For anyone who has ever met a person with dementia, it brings a pang of recognition and for a moment we can experience their point of view, which is very moving.&quot; The offers, says Sutton, are still &quot;flooding in&quot;. &quot;With the level we are at right now, you can safely say it will be one of the biggest books of the fair. The response has been really fantastic with publishers truly engaging with the story, presenting their bids in very imaginative ways. One bid arrived by taxi in a 1940s suitcase full of period items which appear in the novel, another was accompanied by handwritten notes from all members of the staff, from the CEO to sales and marketing executives.&quot; An 11-publisher auction for actress and former Oxford student Jessie Burton, meanwhile, led to a six-figure deal in the UK earlier this week, and another in the US, for her debut The Miniaturist, after agent Juliet Mushens at The Agency Group picked the novel off her bulging slush pile. &quot;I have had 400 submissions that way since December,&quot; says Mushens. &quot;I remember loving her cover letter because she referenced the fact that I had recently read a book she based her research on, and she said she &apos;liked my style&apos; which made me laugh. The first three chapters absolutely got under my skin. When I was halfway through the full manuscript I emailed her to ask if she had signed with anyone else, to which she told me she had four offers from other agents. When I finished it I called her and asked her to meet. We clicked instantly, and had a shared editorial vision for the book which is very important. I can feel a special book somewhere in my stomach. It is hard to put into words \u2013 more an instinct than anything scientific. The Miniaturist is about gender, secrets, love, power, sexuality \u2026 It is poetic and provocative, and so assured, it is hard to believe it is her first book. I fell in love with it and was almost bereft to finish it.&quot; Set in 17th-century Amsterdam, The Miniaturist tells the story of 18-year-old Nella, who is given a miniature replica of her home by her new husband, and begins to see the dramas of her household mirrored in miniature form. Burton says it was born out of a visit to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. &quot;There is a dolls&apos; house there that is more than a dolls&apos; house. It is enormous, breath-taking, a symbol of the wealth and power of the Dutch Golden Age. Men, women and children catch sight of it and sigh with wonder. It is an exact replica of the owner&apos;s house and cost the same as a full blown townhouse to build and furnish. I asked myself, what kind of society allowed such extravagance, and why? I saw this young woman, Nella, turning up to her new marital home, full of a sense of wonder, unaware that so much adversity in this rich and hypocritical society was waiting round the corner for her. It is a story about how much or little we can control our fate, how slenderly we may know a person, how frugality and luxury, love and hate, the domestic and the public spheres of life are inextricable.&quot; She &quot;wrote and rewrote it&quot; in the second half of 2010 and over the next two years, &quot;in theatre dressing rooms, and secretly in city offices&quot;, and says she has &quot;run out of hyperbole&quot; to describe the situation of the last week. &quot;It has been like a sustained carnival with its quieter moments of disbelief and delight. And yes, a little terror. It is so exciting to me to know that the story I have told will be read in languages from Norwegian to Japanese and I feel more than privileged that publishers worldwide have taken the novel to their hearts.&quot; But despite the international book deals pouring in \u2013 Canada, Brazil, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, Serbia and Holland, Turkey and Norway, as well as the US and the UK \u2013 Burton isn&apos;t planning to quit her job quite yet. &quot;I think balance is so important. When I was temping, the boredom of that set itself up nicely as an opposition to what I really wanted, which was to find an agent and get published. It fuelled the hunger to change the way things were going for me. It was, if you like, a comforting struggle. My mum has already told me to get a job. And I always do what my mum says.&quot;", "sentences": ["I fell in love with it and was almost bereft to finish it.&quot; Set in 17th-century Amsterdam, The Miniaturist tells the story of 18-year-old Nella, who is given a miniature replica of her home by her new husband, and begins to see the dramas of her household mirrored in miniature form.", "Burton says it was born out of a visit to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam."], "title": "London Book Fair pins high hopes on debut novelists", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/19/london-book-fair-debut-novelists", "tags": ["London book fair", "Culture", "Books", "Fiction", "Creative writing", "Publishing"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-04-19T14:34:44Z", "article": "Must read 1.

The decision by the Amsterdam district court follows a claim by Nokia that it invented the parts, which it says are made exclusively for its own phones. The discovery follows a &quot;teardown&quot; of the HTC One by Nokia&apos;s engineers to discover what parts are used in it. &quot;Nokia filed this action after it discovered these components in the HTC One,&quot; a spokesman for Nokia said in a statement. &quot;In its marketing materials, HTC claims that its HDR microphone is a key feature for the HTC One. But it is Nokia HAAC technology, developed exclusively for use in Nokia products.&quot; Nokia claims STMicro has agreed exclusivity on the parts. The global injunction will last for a year and stops STMicro from selling the parts to HTC. &quot;HTC has no licence or authorisation from Nokia to use these microphones or the Nokia technologies from which they have been developed,&quot; Nokia said in a statement. That will create fresh problems for HTC, which has already had to delay the launch of its HTC One flagship phone in a number of countries because of problems sourcing camera parts, after it slipped from the &quot;Tier one&quot; group of handset makers. The court case heightens the new fronts being opened in the smartphone patent wars, which are increasingly used by companies to jockey for position. Nokia has used its intellectual property in the mobile space aggressively against a number of rivals, beginning with Apple \u2013 against which it won an ongoing royalty settlement in June 2011 - and in December 2012 from BlackBerry. STMicro will have to pay Nokia \u20ac50,000 (\u00a343,000) for each microphone sold to others, up to a maximum of \u20ac1m. The company said it was considering alternative solutions. In a statement, HTC said: &quot;HTC is disappointed in the decision. We are consulting with STM and will decide whether it is necessary to explore alternative solutions in due course. In the meanwhile, we do not expect this decision to have any immediate impact on our handset sales.&quot; The HTC One is intended to be a flagship device to revive the fortunes of HTC, which has been crushed in a number of markets by South Korea&apos;s Samsung using its broader distribution and carrier relationships. But the launch has already been slowed by problems sourcing camera parts. The latest case is one of a number being brought against HTC by Nokia, which is asserting more than 40 patents in Germany, the US and the UK. Nokia has already won an injunction against HTC in Germany, and filed another on 16 April. HTC is seeing revenues and profits come under increasing pressure as Samsung and Apple tighten their grip on the high-end and mid-range smartphone market. In the first quarter of 2013, its revenues were NT$42.7bn (\u00a3948m) and operating income just \u00a3950,000. Revenues have fallen to less than a quarter of their peak from the third quarter of 2011. By contrast, Nokia&apos;s first-quarter revenues in the mobile space were \u20ac2.89bn but it made an operating loss of \u20ac42m.

This has the sense of an era-defining encounter: Barcelona, who have dominated Europe for the past half-decade (it&apos;s a remarkable fact that, even in their sixth successive semi-final, it still feels as though they have not quite achieved what they might have done in the Champions League) and Bayern, who could be the dominant force of the years to come: Pep past against Pep future in a Pep-less present that could mark the transition from one generation to the next. Or could, conceivably, were Barcelona to win convincingly, assert Bar\u00e7a&apos;s hegemony and perhaps even the growth of a new dynasty under Tito Vilanova. Yet amid the talk of historical sweeps \u2013 justified to an extent by the fact that Bar\u00e7a and Bayern are this season&apos;s champions \u2013 there is the awareness that the champions of last year in either Spain or Germany will await in the final. Neither Real Madrid nor Borussia Dortmund \u2013 one about to change their manager, the other lacking the financial muscle \u2013 look likely to embark on a dynasty, but either is a realistic and would-be worthy champion. As Miguel Delaney has pointed out, games in which a power just past its peak meets a new power on the rise have been remarkably infrequent \u2013 in part because Bar\u00e7a are the first side to command their era since the Juventus of the mid-90s (although the changing format and increased competition meant neither side reeled off hat-tricks of titles like the great sides of the past and their domination was reflected as much in their reputation and influence as in trophies). He suggests there have only been three previous examples, of which the most relevant seems the game between Ajax and Bayern Munich in 1972-73, a tie won 5-2 on aggregate by Ajax after a crushing 4-0 victory in the first leg in Amsterdam. Ajax, on their way to a third successive European Cup, were probably just past their peak, internal divisions beginning to emerge after the iron grip of Rinus Michels had been released. Bayern then perhaps weren&apos;t such a mature side as Bayern now, but West German football was unquestionably on the rise, as had been shown by the national side&apos;s breath-taking success in the European Championship in 1972. Then, as now, the clash was between slightly differing variants of Total Football. There was the Dutch school, all hard-pressing, high offside line and interchanging of positions, and the German school, which didn&apos;t push up to play offside and, which, while still essentially about the creation of space through intermovement, was perhaps slightly more rooted in physicality. And that&apos;s where the strands begin to intertwine. The Dutch school was transplanted, first by Michels and then by Johan Cruyff, to Barcelona. The German school was practised as much by Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach as by Bayern, and it was there that Jupp Heynckes, the present Bayern coach, learned the game. The tactical make-up of both the modern Bayern and the modern Bar\u00e7a was established by Louis van Gaal, whose first experience as a coach had been at Ajax. Pep Guardiola credits Van Gaal even more than Cruyff as the man who influenced his thinking on how the game should be played and at Bayern he will, as he did at Bar\u00e7a (via Raddy Antic&apos;s brief caretaker stint) inherit a side from somebody who succeeded Van Gaal. So the basic styles of the two teams are similar, something borne out by the statistics. Across Europe&apos;s top five leagues this season nobody has achieved a higher percentage of possession than Barcelona with 69.6%; Bayern lie second in the table with 63.6%. Barcelona have a higher pass completion rate than anybody else (89.7%); Bayern are second (87.4%). But for all the similarities, there are subtle differences. Most obviously, there is the shape. While Barcelona play a 4-3-3 with Lionel Messi operating as a false nine (he could, conceivably, operate behind David Villa as a more orthodox centre-forward, with the right flank vacant but for the surges of Dani Alves, as he did against Milan, but it seems improbable on Tuesday night), Bayern prefer a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131, a difference that plays out in the centre of midfield, where Bayern will have two holding players and one advanced central midfielder and Bar\u00e7a one holder flanked by two more creative players. That effectively means the shapes will match up, Sergio Busquets picking up Thomas M\u00fcller with Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta facing Bastian Schweinsteiger and either Luis Gustavo or Javi Mart\u00ednez. In itself, that&apos;s unlikely to favour one side or the other: three central midfielders all doing the jobs they naturally do, although Xavi must be wary of Schweinsteiger&apos;s forward surges. What could complicate things for Bayern is Messi dropping deep. Does one of the centre-backs follow him, potentially creating a gap for a wide player \u2013 Villa and Pedro, presumably \u2013 to dart inside? That is a particular danger given how attacking both Philipp Lahm and David Alaba are; an advanced position would make it all the harder to shuffle in and form a de facto back three. But if the centre-backs stay where they are, Messi creates a three on two in Bar\u00e7a&apos;s favour at the back of the Bayern midfield. Which is, of course, why for a team as good in possession as Bar\u00e7a and not looking for a long outlet ball from the back, a false nine is such a dangerous proposition. That&apos;s where Bar\u00e7a may have an advantage. Where Bayern have a clear edge is in set-plays. No side in any of the top five leagues in Europe wins as few aerial duels per game as Barcelona (9.7 \u2013 Wigan are second with 10.4). In part that&apos;s because they control the ball sufficiently that opponents have limited opportunities to launch high passes at them, but it&apos;s also because of a natural disinclination based on being short. Bayern are 30th in that list, winning 14.9 aerial duels per game. It&apos;s a problem exacerbated by the absence of Carles Puyol and, with Adriano suspended, Marc Bartra, who has made only 21 appearances for Barcelona in total, is likely to play. Bayern are a bigger team and must think corners and free-kicks offer a great opportunity. It&apos;s important, though, not to be drawn into the cliche of physical Germans against technical Spaniards, even if Bayern do have a slight physical edge. What will be fascinating is seeing not only the two best possession teams in Europe facing off, but also the two best pressing sides. Barcelona&apos;s players will never have been placed under such co-ordinated pressure on the ball as they are likely to be on Tuesday \u2013 and vice-versa. It&apos;s in the pressing as much as in his goals that Mario Mandzukic, suspended for the first leg, will be missed. &quot;His stamina is endless,&quot; said Felix Magath. &quot;I think he could play two back-to-back high-tempo games.&quot; Much as Samuel Eto&apos;o used to do for Bar\u00e7a, Mandzukic leads the press for Bayern; whether Mario Gomez has the energy \u2013 or indeed the intelligence \u2013 to do that is doubtful. But these are the details. They may determine how the tie plays out but what will be remembered is the outcome, whether the age of Bar\u00e7a has yet become the age of Bayern.", "sentences": ["He suggests there have only been three previous examples, of which the most relevant seems the game between Ajax and Bayern Munich in 1972-73, a tie won 5-2 on aggregate by Ajax after a crushing 4-0 victory in the first leg in Amsterdam."], "title": "Bayern Munich v Barcelona: Pep past v Pep future in a Pepless present", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/apr/23/bayern-munich-barcelona-pep-champions-league", "tags": ["Champions League", "Football tactics", "Pep Guardiola", "Barcelona", "Bayern Munich", "Football", "Sport", "Champions League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-04-24T10:31:41Z", "article": "Beyonc\u00e9 has banned professional photographers from her current world tour.

This contest was poised for the final whistle when David Luiz&apos;s free-kick scuttled through Yann Sommer&apos;s weak attempt to block and the visitors had the first-leg lead their display merited. Rafael Ben\u00edtez could depart with some satisfaction, the prospect of a slog of a season yielding a trophy still alive. The sense of deflation that pursued the Swiss from an arena where they have seemed almost unbeatable in recent times reinforced the sense that this tie is there for Chelsea to claim. The London club have never lost the home leg of a European semi-final and the Swiss have never prevailed on English soil. History is with Ben\u00edtez&apos;s team, for all that they must compete next week without the suspended Ashley Cole. It may help, too, that the flurry of near-misses endured this term will guard them against complacency, but the prospect of a second successive European trophy looms large. They warranted this success even if their profligacy, compounded by a baffling late refereeing decision, had threatened to send the teams back to England still level. Further goals should have been added to Victor Moses&apos;s early reward before, three minutes from time, the substitute Jacques Zoua headed into the area and Valentin Stocker tumbled beyond C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta&apos;s attempt to intercept, with no discernible contact made and no appeal lodged. Chelsea were aghast as the Czech referee pointed to the spot. &quot;A very strange decision,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez, with Fabian Sch\u00e4r duly thumping in the penalty and Basel&apos;s hope suddenly rising.           The Chelsea manager might have settled for a draw at that stage, fearful of his team wilting in the face of a late onslaught, but their rally in the time that remained was a reminder of their underlying qualities. Oscar, a substitute, might have scored before a trio of headers, from Branislav Ivanovic via Moses to John Terry in front of goal, culminated in Sommer mustering a remarkable point-blank save from the Blues captain. The game was in stoppage time by then but Basel were so panicked that Stocker tripped Ramires in the seconds that remained and the resultant free-kick was too tempting for David Luiz to pass up. Fabian Frei and Stocker parted obligingly as the Brazilian strode up, the ball zipping across the turf and through the goalkeeper&apos;s feeble attempt to block. The Brazilian&apos;s manic celebrations in front of the contingent of visiting fans, eyes wild beneath that familiar mop of hair, betrayed a smouldering sense of injustice at the penalty award. The Brazilian might have counted himself lucky to have been involved at that stage, his studs-up follow-through on to Philipp Degen&apos;s right shin having earned him only a booking when Pavel Kralovec might have flashed red. Ben\u00edtez suggested his player was merely a &quot;little bit late&quot; with the tackle, but Aleksander Dragovic could consider himself just as fortunate to have avoided a dismissal for an earlier two-foot lunge on David Luiz. The defender turned central midfielder had been outstanding all night, Frank Lampard a calming presence at his side as Basel were blunted in the centre. Throw in the excellence of Cole on his return from a hamstring injury \u2013 his booking for time-wasting was exasperating \u2013 the slippery performance of Eden Hazard, and the industry and bite offered by Ramires and Moses at each end, and this was a dominant display. The Nigerian had registered first, albeit rather fortunately, as Lampard&apos;s corner looped beyond Ivanovic, leaping among centre-halves, and struck Moses to bounce down and over Mohamed Elneny on the goalline. But Chelsea should have had more reward for their endeavours even by then. Sommer had done well at his near post to deny Lampard a 201st goal for the club, a chance created by Hazard and Azpilicueta, with the Belgian later wasteful when clean through as the interval approached. His attempt, as Park Joo-ho slid in and Sommer charged out, had dribbled wide but his effervescent display as the team&apos;s playmaker, with Juan Mata rested, deserved better. Hazard was a blur of cute and clever passes, perfectly weighted beyond the flustered home full-backs for galloping wingers to collect. For a while it felt as if the misses might cost the Premier League team, the memory of Basel&apos;s capabilities when they click \u2013 as demonstrated against Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter-final \u2013 still fresh. Stocker&apos;s low shot which thudded against the base of a post offered a reminder of that pedigree, though each scare provoked a response. This was not to be Fernando Torres&apos;s night, the Spaniard also thumping a shot against a post from Hazard&apos;s pull-back, but he will be a threat in the return, when Basel must be expansive if they are to retrieve the tie and become the first Swiss side to reach a Uefa final.

The European Cup holders carry a narrow advantage, and two away goals, into next Thursday&apos;s game at Stamford Bridge as they seek to become the first team to follow Champions League success by securing the Europa League. David Luiz&apos;s free-kick deep into stoppage time defeated Basel, with the only concern from the evening a caution for Ashley Cole that rules the England international out of the second leg. &quot;It&apos;s true that we had this feeling that we didn&apos;t deserve to concede this goal, this penalty, which was an extra motivation,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez, who was baffled by the Czech referee&apos;s decision to penalise C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta for a perceived foul on Valentin Stocker despite no contact having been made. &quot;It was not a penalty and we were surprised it was awarded. To give one, it has to be very, very clear, and no one around me felt it was a foul. I was worried when that went against us. But, in the end, though, everyone would say the win was fair. &quot;The feeling was that we deserved to score a second goal, and sometimes you have some good luck as a result. It was a deserved win. But we have the experience of what Basel did to Tottenham Hotspur [in the quarter-final], so we know they&apos;re a good team who can score goals home and away, so we have to be sure to concentrate next week.

The interim manager was less critical of the official for only booking David Luiz, employed in central midfield, for a foul on Philipp Degen which might have warranted a dismissal. &quot;They were pressing him a lot of time, and he didn&apos;t get the fouls,&quot; he said. &quot;The foul for his yellow card was maybe right because he was a little bit late, but that&apos;s it. &quot;This was a very intense game played at a high tempo and we had to do our job, but we did very well.

Their hands are black with dirt and their faces are hidden by headscarves that protect them from the high sun. An estimated 500 gancheros (recyclers) work at Cateura on the outskirts of Asunci\u00f3n, where 1.5 tonnes of rubbish are deposited daily, separating plastic and aluminium that they sell on for as little as 15p a bag. Among the mounds of refuse, however, are used oven trays and paint pots. Cast aside by the 2 million residents of the capital of Paraguay, they are nonetheless highly valued by Nicol\u00e1s G\u00f3mez, who picks them out to make violins, guitars and cellos. G\u00f3mez, 48, was a carpenter and ganchero but now works for Favio Ch\u00e1vez, the conductor of Paraguay&apos;s one and only landfill orchestra.     Favio Ch\u00e1vez, director of the Cateura Orchestra of Recycled Instruments, sculpting the neck of a string instrument from an old strip of wood. Photograph: Jonathan Gilbert    The Cateura Orchestra of Recycled Instruments is made up of 30 schoolchildren \u2013 the sons and daughters of recyclers \u2013 whose instruments are forged from the city&apos;s rubbish. And while its members learned to play amid the flies and stench of Cateura, they are now receiving worldwide acclaim, culminating earlier this month with a concert in Amsterdam that included Pachelbel&apos;s Canon. The project was born in 2006 when Ch\u00e1vez, 37, began work at the landfill as a technician, helping recyclers to classify refuse. But his passion for music took him home each weekend to the small town of Carapegu\u00e1, 50 miles from Asunci\u00f3n, to conduct a youth orchestra. After he brought the group to Cateura to perform, the gancheros asked Ch\u00e1vez if he could teach music to their children, many of whom would spend afternoons playing in the rubbish as they waited for their parents to finish work. But as the months passed, Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 a longtime fan of Les Luthiers, an Argentinian band that uses homemade instruments \u2013 realised the ever-growing number of children under his tutelage needed to practise at home if they were to progress. &quot;A violin is worth more than a recycler&apos;s house,&quot; says Ch\u00e1vez. &quot;We couldn&apos;t give a child a formal instrument as it would have put him in a difficult position. The family may have looked to sell or trade it.     Nicol\u00e1s G\u00f3mez, a former ganchero, makes a violin from an old oven tray. Photograph: Jonathan Gilbert    &quot;So we experimented with making them from the rubbish. We discovered which materials were most comfortable, which projected the right sound and which withstood the tension of the strings. It was fine to hand these out as they had no monetary value.&quot; G\u00f3mez travels three times a week to Cateura to dig out material. He shapes the metal oven trays with an electric saw to form the body of a violin and engineers cellos from oil barrels. The necks of his string instruments are sculpted from old strips of wood, called pal\u00e9. Now with the aid of colleagues, Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 who has been teaching music since he was 13 \u2013 uses the instruments to give classes to around 70 children and also directs weekly orchestra practice. But he has a goal that goes beyond music. Ch\u00e1vez believes the mentality required to learn an instrument can be applied more widely to lift his pupils out of poverty. Paraguay is the fastest-growing country in the Americas, but nearly a third of its population lives below the poverty line. The gancheros and their children live in slums, called ba\u00f1ados, which occupy the swamps between Asunci\u00f3n and the River Paraguay. &quot;The state does nothing,&quot; says Gladys \u00c1guilar, 61, from a shantytown next to the landfill. &quot;Politicians put a sweet in our mouths with their promises. But when they are elected all they care about is power and the sweet turns bitter.&quot; Ch\u00e1vez recognises the shortcomings of the government, but says families can improve their lives by considering the long term. &quot;Poor people need to eat today,&quot; he says. &quot;They don&apos;t think about tomorrow&apos;s problems. But learning music means you have to plan. It&apos;s very challenging to explain to a child who lives in adverse conditions that if his dream is to play the piano he needs to sit on a stool for five hours a day.&quot; Many parents also struggle to see the advantages of such an attitude. &quot;Most tell their kids that a violin can&apos;t feed you; that they need to work to eat,&quot; says Jorge R\u00edos, 35, a recycler whose two daughters play in the orchestra. &quot;But thanks to that violin my kids have seen new countries. They have an opportunity for a better future.&quot; Ada and No\u00e9lia R\u00edos started attending Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s classes in a chapel two years ago after their grandmother, also a recycler, signed them up. They enjoy Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s strict regime, practising for two hours a day at their home \u2013 a shack with earth floors in the San Cayetano slum \u2013 and have travelled around Latin America with the orchestra. &quot;My dream is to be a musician,&quot; says No\u00e9lia, 13, clutching her guitar, made by G\u00f3mez from two large tins that once contained a Paraguayan sweet potato dessert. Her 16-year-old aunt, Mar\u00eda R\u00edos, also plays in the orchestra. &quot;Going to other countries has opened my mind so much,&quot; says Ada, 14, a violinist. Following the trip to Amsterdam \u2013 its first outside of South America \u2013 the orchestra will play this year in Argentina, the US, Canada, Palestine, Norway and Japan. Ch\u00e1vez has also received an invitation to play at June&apos;s Meltdown festival in London. Like her sister, Ada hopes to become a musician and also dreams of owning a Stradivarius violin, worth millions of pounds. But for now she is more than content to play her current instrument, whose face was taken from an old paint tin. &quot;I don&apos;t care that my violin is made out of recycled parts,&quot; she says. &quot;To me, it&apos;s a treasure.&quot;", "sentences": ["And while its members learned to play amid the flies and stench of Cateura, they are now receiving worldwide acclaim, culminating earlier this month with a concert in Amsterdam that included Pachelbel&apos;s Canon.", "Following the trip to Amsterdam \u2013 its first outside of South America \u2013 the orchestra will play this year in Argentina, the US, Canada, Palestine, Norway and Japan."], "title": "Paraguayan landfill orchestra makes sweet music from rubbish", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/26/paraguayan-landfill-orchestra-music", "tags": ["Paraguay", "Classical music", "Recycling", "Waste", "Environment", "Americas", "World news", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-04-26T15:30:00Z", "article": "A pink lobster rests on a\u00a0glistening metal platter, surrounded by furrowed brown clam shells and black-eyed, gossamer-legged shrimps. A hunk of bread and a glass of amber liquid complete the still life. Set in a pool of deep shadow, the mutely lit objects in this\u00a0photograph by Mat Collishaw beautifully resemble foodstuffs painted by some Dutch artist in the age of Vermeer. You might expect to find such a picture hanging in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. But the calm conceals a\u00a0terrible truth: we are looking at a reconstruction of the last meal of Allen Lee Davis, who was executed in Florida in 1999. Davis was convicted of a brutal crime: in 1982, he murdered Nancy Weller and her two young daughters, Kristina, nine, and Katherine, five, in\u00a0Jacksonville, Florida. But his own execution became a grisly farce when the electric chair failed to deliver the clean death it was supposed to, and witnesses heard him scream and saw him bleed. It was the last time the electric chair was used in Florida, which now prefers to end the lives of prisoners with a lethal injection. For his last meal, Davis requested and got the banquet that Collishaw has reassembled and photographed to look like an Old Master painting: a\u00a0lobster tail, fried potatoes, fried clams, fried shrimp, garlic bread and\u00a0root beer. Collishaw&apos;s Last Meal On Death Row series is one of the eerily paradoxical works in which this powerful artist confronts beauty with horror. Other meals in the series are far more restrained. Karla Faye Tucker, who when she died in 1998 was the first woman executed in Texas since 1863, chose a healthy final meal of fruit and salad. Collishaw has pictured it in a sombre light that deliberately recalls paintings by the 17th-century Spanish religious artist and still life master Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n. Tucker had converted to Christianity in prison. Collishaw gives his imagined picture of her last meal a spiritual intensity. In his studio in a converted south London pub, Collishaw is remembering his own religious childhood. His parents are members of the fundamentalist Christadelphian sect, and he grew up in Nottingham in a strictly regulated household where Christmas was not celebrated \u2013 he got no presents \u2013 and TV was forbidden. &quot;I get on with my parents now,&quot; he says, &quot;but those kinds of things were difficult.&quot; Once, he recalls, &quot;I came home to find my dad burning all my copies of the Face.&quot; This childhood helps to make sense of his apparent compulsion to break rules, defy moral codes and, as it were, profane the host. Collishaw is an artist of risk and menace, whose work takes its audience to some very dark places. Once there was a name for this kind of provocative imagery: we called it Young British Art. Collishaw is one of the YBAs, a name coined in the 1990s for a generation or a school or just a gang of artists who were then becoming internationally celebrated. He is a hardcore original YBA whose most famous early work, Bullet Hole, appeared in the exhibition Freeze that his friend Damien Hirst curated in a docklands warehouse in 1988. It is a massively enlarged photograph of a bullet hole in\u00a0a human head, seen as a purple-lipped orifice surrounded by greasy hair. Through the giant hole you see darkness. Again, there is a religious echo: it is like one of the wounds of Christ in a painting of the Passion. Not that anyone noticed at the time, when Young British Art was tabloid headline, shock-horror stuff and its deeper meanings were rarely considered. Even by people\u00a0who acknowledged it had any.     With Tracey Emin at the Serpentine Gallery summer party in 2005. Photograph: Getty    Collishaw flitted in and out of the tabloid version of the new British art. He was Tracey Emin&apos;s boyfriend, as well as one of Hirst&apos;s best pals (as he still is: Collishaw recently took up painting after Hirst gave him 10 huge boxes of paint). And, of all the YBAs, he did project the image of being young, wild and a bit of a romantic. He photographed himself bare-chested in a pond on Clapham Common, trying to catch fairies. He posed as Narcissus gazing in a puddle (not so much recreating a Renaissance painting as restaging the\u00a0cover photograph from the Smiths&apos; single This Charming Man). A raw, urban romanticism, a\u00a0whiff of youthful daring came off his art. And now he is in his 40s. I owe Mat Collishaw an apology. In 2009 I sat at a\u00a0boardroom table in Tate Britain discussing who should be shortlisted for the Turner prize, as one of that year&apos;s jury. I suggested Collishaw, who was still young enough \u2013 Turner Prize artists have to be under 50 \u2013 and in my opinion getting better all the time. I thought he deserved to be shortlisted for a series of photographs of butterflies crushed and smashed and seen apparently at the moment of their deaths, enlarged into great gaudy smears of colour. What haunting images of beauty and ruin, life and death. But one fellow juror said this could happen only if we created &quot;an all-YBA shortlist&quot;, the last hurrah of the movement that made British art famous. In the thinking of the\u00a0art world, the Collishaw generation are the establishment now and their stuff is old hat. Sensation and shock are dirty words, crude populism frowned upon now that modern art is the favourite entertainment of the well-heeled middle class. Art now, apparently, is more subtle than it used to be, as are our souls. The mind of visceral art\u00a0that drew crowds to Sensation! at the Royal Academy in 1997 is judged too brash and loud. I lost the argument. So no Turner for Collishaw. Instead, he has a retrospective about to open at\u00a0the Arter Foundation in Istanbul, a show that foregrounds his political conscience in powerful works such as Last Meal On Death Row. For me, Collishaw is a good political artist for the same reason he is a good religious artist and a good artist-artist. It is because he believes in the efficacy of images. Not for him the abstract evasion, the minimalist half smile \u2013 fashionable or not, he wants to punch your imagination in the\u00a0stomach. He justifies the art of sensation by showing how it can have depth in its\u00a0oomph. He is very articulate on the subject, as we chat in his studio while looking through drawers full of Insecticides, the pictures for which I wanted to shortlist him for the Turner. &quot;Shock makes us feel more alive,&quot; he insists. Sure, back in the 90s, &quot;Some people were using shock art as a fuck-you-in-your-face kind of thing&quot;, but for him shock is much more serious, and all his favourite painters from the past make use of it \u2013 &quot;great art that I like when I go to the National Gallery, like Caravaggio and Rubens and G\u00e9ricault and Delacroix.&quot;     Collishaw's best-known early work, Bullet Hole (1988).  Photograph: Courtesy of Mat Collishaw and Blain|Southern    The book on his desk is a new academic study of the 19th-century French poet and art critic Charles Baudelaire \u2013 specifically, about his drug use. Baudelaire was surely taking drugs when he celebrated his favourite artist, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, whose paintings indulge in violent excesses worthy of any artist of today. Delacroix&apos;s painting The Death Of Sardanapalus portrays a tyrant killing himself on a vast pink bed surrounded by his harem and slaves in a frenzied apocalyptic party. Its mood of dissipation haunts Collishaw&apos;s art. In his photograph Burnt Almonds, he recreates a scene described by a Russian officer in the ruins of Berlin in 1945: a Nazi officer and his mistress lie dead, having taken poison in the middle of a last decadent party. In a new cycle of paintings that Collishaw has created \u2013 they are being finished by an assistant in the downstairs of the pub \u2013 he enlarges empty cocaine wrappers to suggest the decadence of the high-flying financial world on the eve of the credit crash. His Nazi picture, he says, shows &quot;a total corruption of beauty&quot;. His use of shock always involves &quot;seduction and beauty&quot;. I am staring at the Last Meal Of Death Row pictures pinned on his studio wall as he says this. You can scarcely have a starker example of art that lures the eye, only to punish the mind with terrible knowledge. Other subjects he has eerily illuminated with installations and images that are at once beautiful and appalling include war photography, Victorian child prostitution and, most recently, the portrayal of poverty. His\u00a0Istanbul exhibition includes the premiere of a video in which he stretches photojournalist Kevin Carter&apos;s famous image of a child apparently being stalked by a vulture in the Sudan famine in 1993 into an event that happens in time, in slow-motion. By animating Carter&apos;s shot, he wants to question the way we take pictures at face value \u2013 this image became controversial because some said Carter should have intervened, and he responded by telling contradictory stories about it. Soon after winning a Pulitzer for this perfect press photograph, Carter took his own life. &quot;He couldn&apos;t make another image that gave him that buzz,&quot; Collishaw says. In the basement of his pub, we encounter a couple of mangy stuffed animals; Collishaw lives with taxidermist-artist Polly Morgan, and they are currently showing together in an exhibition in Walsall about contemporary art and nature called The Nature Of The Beast. Of all the images with which he seduces and confounds the onlooker, Collishaw&apos;s flowers are his most beguiling and disgusting achievements. He has been experimenting with flowers since the 1990s, breeding \u2013 he claims \u2013 hybrid blooms that attest to genetic mutation. His Infectious Flowers started as photographs and have recently been realised as\u00a0monstrous sculptures. &quot;I make a beautiful flower,&quot; as he puts it, &quot;and\u00a0then I have to go and infect it with venereal disease.&quot; Black sores well up on pink petals, and in his 2012 sculpture The Venal Muse: Fenside, orchidean blooms have turned into gory pustulating columns of suppurating flesh. Nature\u00a0produces monsters, and life evolves into\u00a0corrupted versions of itself. Collishaw placed his venereal flowers instead of bouquets at the entrance to his recent exhibition about the madness of the bankers on the eve of the crash. His art is lovely and vile. It is an art of our time and it hits true, like a bullet in the head. \u2022 Mat Collishaw is at Arter, Istanbul from 2 May to 11 September. The Nature Of The Beast runs until 30 June at New Art Gallery, Walsall This article was edited on 29 April 2013.

It isn&apos;t exactly a tourist area: it&apos;s very mountainous, very wild and beautiful but it has wonderful white sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters. There are direct flights from Gatwick to Bastia on Sundays with easyJet and some tour operators go there but I would recommend backpacking around the tiny, sparsely inhabited fishing and mountain villages. Cap Corse stretches from Erbalunga on the east coast to the D\u00e9sert des Agriates at the bottom of the west, but its heart lies between Brando and Nonza. In the middle, there is a walking trail called the Chemin de Lumi\u00e8re: eight chapels that helped medieval travellers cross the Cape through the mountains. In Pino, the church of Santa Maria Assunta has exceptional baroque frescoes, and there are lots of private mausoleums: the most famous and spectacular is the tomb of Gustave Eiffel&apos;s wife in Nonza. There are very good hostels (auberges) and great local food in every village. Alternatively, I&apos;d suggest Provence. A few kilometres east of Avignon (to which Eurostar will run a direct service this summer), just next to the Luberon \u2013 but less posh \u2013 L&apos;Isle sur la Sorgue is a small town famous for its antique\u00a0shops, art and craft boutiques, waterside cafes and restaurants \u2013 and an array of working water wheels.

Seventeen shades of red, yellow, orange and pink merge into each other as you wander around the spiralling streets. This summer I will head to the Giens Peninsula. Ryanair flies to Toulon from Liverpool and Stansted. A lot of people drive straight to Les Iles d&apos;Or but I will stop at the strip of land between salt marshes and a long sandy beach behind the pine forest. From there, I will go early to the Port du Niel to buy fish from the fishermen, visit the wine shop in La Capte, and then enjoy the sunset on Almanarre beach, near the little harbour of La Madrague. For real qualit\u00e9 de vie, go to the Var and visit its small inland villages like Correns, Collobri\u00e8res and Salerne. My tip for accommodation: in La Croix Valmer (close to Cap Lardier) there&apos;s a great B&amp;B called Le Refuge (lerefuge-cotedazur.fr). Ask for the room on the first floor with the terrasse.\u2022 atout-france.fr Tom Hall, travel editor, Lonely Planet Last summer I took my family to Switzerland in search of scenic railways and mountaintop playgrounds. After a jaw-dropping week we found all that and more, camping on the shores of Lake Thun, a short train ride from Interlaken. A trip to Switzerland needn&apos;t break the bank \u2013 campsites are dotted around Interlaken, for instance, and railpasses make travelling round the country more affordable. Getting out on to the water is a great way to leave the crowds behind. I&apos;ve since heard about a rafting trip from Thun to the capital, Bern, that serves up fast-flowing Alpine water, views of the Bernese Alps and the chance of spotting storks, from an inflatable boat or canoe. The 28km paddle takes three to four hours, depending on water levels. Prices start at 80CHF (\u00a356) for a two-person canoe (myswitzerland.com/en/aare-rafting-canoeing.html). Once the boat is dropped off in Bern, you can explore this beautiful capital&apos;s medieval architecture and refuel at street cafes. This summer, we&apos;re are heading to northern Spain on the ferry (Brittany Ferries goes from Portsmouth and Plymouth to Bilbao and Santander) for more camping and mountains, with art, tapas and Spanish practice thrown in for good measure. I&apos;m also going to the Western Isles in Scotland for a week&apos;s cycling, but that&apos;s just me and my sleeping bag \u2013 no enthusiastic small boys in tow.\u2022 lonelyplanet.com Michael Cullen, editor-in-chief, i-escape My top tip for summer 2013 is the tiny Greek island of Kastellorizo, in the south-east Aegean. It&apos;s one of the smallest and most remote of Greece&apos;s islands \u2013 just two miles across, and reached by a tiny plane (or three-hour ferry) from Rhodes, 80 miles away. Or you can cross from Kas in Turkey, with a little planning. That&apos;s probably why it&apos;s not on many people&apos;s radars. There&apos;s only one village, Megisti, a picture-perfect horseshoe harbour fronted by pastel-painted houses and bobbing boats, home to the island&apos;s 300 inhabitants and, in the brief two-month tourist season, a similar number of adventurous visitors. Paths lead around the coast or up to a hilltop monastery. Don&apos;t expect sandy beaches, do expect iridescent turquoise seas (especially in the Blue Grotto sea cave), fresh seafood, and a laid-back, unhurried lifestyle that would seduce even the nerviest banker into blissful lethargy. This is Greece as it should be, not as the papers paint it. Stay at Caretta (i-escape.com/caretta), a collection of budget rooms and studios.     Kastellorizo, Greece. Photograph: Hercules Milas/Alamy    My other discovery this year is La Palma, the most north-westerly of the Canaries, and a world away from neighbouring Tenerife. It&apos;s got a fantastic variety of scenery, from black sand beaches to volcanic peaks and huge swathes of pine forest. This, along with westerly sea breezes, keeps it relatively cool in summer (25-30C). Hikers will be in heaven: there are over 1,000km of marked trails, including a spectacular circuit through the Caldera de Taburiente, ringed by jagged peaks and haloes of cloud. The coast is mostly rocky, with coves and endless banana plantations; the two main towns (Los Llanos and Santa Cruz) conceal rainbow-painted colonial centres with a lazy cafe culture. Apart from a couple of minor resorts around Puerto Naos, there&apos;s little development; but that is likely to change with the recent opening of a new airport and direct flights from Gatwick and Manchester, with Thomson. Our advice is to book a small villa: they cost barely more than a hotel room in other parts of Europe. One of our favourites is Casa Los Geranios (i-escape.com/casa-los-geranios) in the south.\u2022 i-escape.com David Mantero, senior buyer, Stanfords travel bookshop Looking at our best-sellers, Turkey appears to be hot this summer, but then it has been for a couple of years. On a smaller scale, but certainly trending at the moment, are Naples and the Amalfi coast. I think the Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition at the British Museum might have brought this destination to people&apos;s attention. It is, in fact, a great holiday spot besides the historical sites, with a beautiful seaside and plenty of opportunities for outdoor activities. We have also seen a surge of interest in Amsterdam. It is the 400th anniversary of Amsterdam&apos;s canals this year and there are plenty of celebrations planned for the summer. Not so well known but worth exploring is Asturias in northern Spain. I genuinely love the area and have always recommended it. In Asturias you can find breathtaking mountain scenery only a few miles from beautiful, unspoilt stretches of beach. It is a great place for hiking, cycling and white-water activities but it also has beautiful historic villages and Oviedo and Gij\u00f3n, its two major cities, are well worth visiting. Oviedo is calm and beautiful and Gij\u00f3n is vibrant and fun and in both there are plenty of places to eat great food and drink local cider. Also, the way the economy is in Spain at the moment, it should be possible to get good deals. I have just come back from Vietnam and it was wonderful. Great food and so inexpensive that you almost save money while travelling. \u2022 stanfords.co.uk Alexis Josephides, product development manager, Sunvil Holidays  Anyone considering Greece should try the southern Peloponnese on the mainland, rather than an island. This beautiful area is still relatively unknown to non-Greeks, and the rugged landscape and distance from Athens means it has avoided the development and tourist numbers of more established Greek islands. The nearest to a resort here is Stoupa, about a third of the way down the central Mani peninsula. Best reached from Kalamata airport, this pretty village is blessed with lovely sandy beaches and a magnificent mountain backdrop, and although there are plenty of tavernas and cafes, it remains relatively low key. Further south, almost at the foot of the peninsula, the remote and tiny fishing hamlet of Gerolimenas is home to one of Greece&apos;s finest boutique hotels \u2013 the Kyrimai (kyrimai.gr), converted from a 19th-century warehouse, with sea on two sides. A couple of hours&apos; drive east, the medieval fortress town of Monemvasia is one of Greece&apos;s &quot;must-see&quot; attractions, on a thickly fortified rock only reached by a narrow causeway. I haven&apos;t had a summer holiday since 2008 but this year I really want to drive around the Peloponnese.\u2022 sunvil.co.uk Simon Wrench, commercial manager, Inntravel I would recommend exploring the Danish Riviera, Zealand, Denmark&apos;s largest island. It&apos;s where the laid-back, cycle-loving Danish city dwellers go to take it easy, and has gorgeous coastal villages, superb seafood, white-sand beaches and fairytale castles. The Danish Maritime Museum) will open on 29 June in a dry dock in the shadow of Kronborg Castle, the setting for Shakespeare&apos;s Hamlet and home, in August, to a Shakespeare festival where visitors can watch his plays in an open-air theatre. August and September are the best months to visit when the weather is usually warm and calm. It&apos;s flat so good for easy cycling.     Zealand, Denmark. Photograph: Alamy    Well off the tourist trail, southern Moravia, a hidden corner of the Czech Republic, is a beautiful spot, with lots of vineyards, and the &quot;Garden of Europe&quot;, one of the largest artificial landscapes in Europe. At the Znojmo Historical Vintage festival (13-14 September), the Czech Republic&apos;s largest wine festival, visitors can taste wine, listen to music and watch dancing, fencing and a knights&apos; tournament. Last year, we had a week of fun walking in the Bernese Oberland, Switzerland, and were blessed with brilliant blue skies. My three kids loved stopping off at the mountain cafes, swimming in the hotel pools and doing the map reading. This year isn&apos;t quite decided, but it&apos;s definitely going to combine cycling with sandy beaches. \u2022 inntravel.co.uk Richard Hammond, founder of greentraveller.co.uk For those who want a green trip, France is really easily accessible from the UK by train or ferry, so I would recommend a wonderful rail journey south to Nice, and into the heart of the Alpes Maritimes to the little-known Mercantour national park. I also like the little-visited region of Mayenne, one of France&apos;s best-kept secrets, situated where Normandy, Brittany and the Loire meet. There are leisurely family-friendly bike routes, natural pools and treehouses, such as Orion Treehouses, near the fortified village of St Paul de Vence. Last summer I stayed at one of the National Trust properties on the Stackpole Estate in Pembrokeshire. From there it&apos;s a 10-minute walk to beautiful Barafundle Bay (you can also kayak to it, like my wife did one morning), but my favourite part of the holiday was the mile-long walk through the lovely Bosherston Lily Ponds to the large, sandy dune-backed Broad Haven South. This summer, I&apos;m planning to take the train to west Sweden. I&apos;ve been to the Weather Islands in the spring, and want to go back in high summer, hire a cabin, swim and eat fresh fish for 10 days.\u2022 greentraveller.co.uk Alison Couper, director of communications, Hotels.com Our Corfu searches are up five fold and with hotel prices falling on average by 11%, it&apos;s a good-value destination. We&apos;ve found Barcelona hotel prices have dropped by 4%, making this cultural gem more appealing, too. And perennial good-value favourites Greece and Spain remain popular. Lesser-known summer destinations, such as Bulgaria, Germany and Poland, are gaining a lot of traction. The Golden Sands beach in Bulgaria, reputed to be one of the best in Europe, is just 16km away from the city of Varna, a town filled with lots of good-value hotels. While Germany is not a traditional summer destination, Kampen in Sylt, with its white-sand beach and red cliffs, is becoming more popular with Europeans. Sopot in Poland is on the Baltic Sea and while the water is cold, the seaside town has lots going for it. Last year I took my two small children to Jordan, a fabulous place with so much diversity in a relativity small space. This year we are off camping on \u00cele de R\u00e9 off the west coast of France in the summer and going to the Kruger national park in October. \u2022 hotels.com Bob Atkinson, travel expert, TravelSupermarket.com Despite the fall in the value of the pound, Spain is still one of the cheapest places to visit in Europe, and some businesses have dropped their prices while the country is affected by the recession. Flying into Malaga is easy, with low-cost flights and cheap pre-book car hire, then I&apos;d head for Andaluc\u00eda&apos;s interior, perhaps to Mijas or Ronda, then Antequera. Heading east towards Nerja, there are good options towards the Sierra Nevada. I&apos;d explore the historic white villages, take a trip around a sherry bodega in Jerez or explore the captivating Mezquita (mosque) in C\u00f3rdoba, where Islam and Christianity sit side by side in the same complex.     Street cafe in the old town, Mijas, Andalucia, Spain. Photograph: Alamy    Last year I did three big trips, (though not in summer) to North Korea via Beijing, Jordan on an Exodus group trip, and a Caribbean fly cruise. This year I&apos;ll do big trips to western Australia in May, to visit friends in Perth and travel up the coast with them to Broome. I&apos;m also doing a two-week adventure trip with Explore, visiting Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica. I do lots of cheap European weekends too: this year I&apos;ll visit Stockholm, Budapest, Moscow, Hamburg, Cologne, Lisbon, Belfast and Palma City.\u2022 travelsupermarket.com  Lucy Kane, travel editor, Rough Guides My top picks for summer 2013 include Tbilisi, the captivating capital of Georgia, which sits at the junction between Europe and Asia. Flights don&apos;t yet operate from the UK, but it&apos;s a quick and cheap hop from one of its neighbours, like Turkey or Bulgaria. There&apos;s warm, sunny weather, attractive art deco architecture, narrow cobbled streets and traditional domed churches. The food and wine scene is fast developing and the nightlife is as buoyant as you wish to make it. Palma, capital of Mallorca, has long been the classic launchpad for heavy-beat summer parties, but you&apos;d be making a mistake heading straight out of the city. Along with a first-rate modern art gallery \u2013 Es Baluard (esbaluard.org/en) \u2013 sophisticated restaurants and funky bars with rooftop terraces that holler &quot;sundowner&quot;, the city has freshened up, smartened up and is now on our 2013 destination list. For a rural trip, head for Montenegro. Compared to Croatia, which is teeming with European holidaymakers in peak season, the country is still relatively unknown, underdeveloped and inexpensive. Montenegro&apos;s interior is a mass of forest-covered mountains, hiding secluded B&amp;Bs and villas, most within reach of the coast&apos;s pretty beaches. For more peace and quiet, and affordable travelling, take your pick from any Greek island, avoiding the main package resorts like Rhodes. One of our favourites is Tinos, with its lovely beaches and unspoiled villages. Stretch your legs on a great one-hour walk \u2013 the Dovecote Trail \u2013 which passes beautifully restored dovecote houses and rustic tavernas. As to my own holidays, after getting married last June, my new husband and I hopped on a jet to Florence for some extremely sweaty sightseeing, followed by a more relaxing stop in rural Tuscany for walks round perfect medieval towns, like lovely Volpaia, red-wine hangovers and over-enthusiastic carb-loading. Then we took the speedy train to Naples, from where we headed eastwards into the hills behind the Amalfi coast. The absolute highlight was climbing Mount Vesuvius and inspecting the havoc it wreaked in AD 79 at Herculaneum. This year we&apos;re set for more walking, wine and medieval villages, but this time in France and the Dordogne. I&apos;ve just edited the new Rough Guide to the Dordogne and the Lot (out 1 May), and fell in love with the region via the mere medium of words, so it&apos;ll be wonderful to see it in real life. \u2022 roughguides.com Phoebe Smith, editor, Wanderlust travel magazine This year it&apos;s time to check out the Baltics \u2013 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Thanks to new frequent flights with Ryanair from Stansted and Manchester to Tallinn, Estonia, taking a little over two-and-a-half hours, this corner of northern Europe is more accessible, yet it has remained under the radar. Before the crowds discover it, go this July for the &quot;white nights&quot; of summer, when the sun doesn&apos;t set until 11pm, giving you nearly 20 hours of daylight to play with. Because of its flat terrain, discovering this often ignored trio of countries by bike is the perfect way to have an adventure. You&apos;ll pedal through picture-perfect fishing villages, past medieval turreted towers and traverse Lahemaa, Estonia&apos;s first national park (visitestonia.com). Last year I spent my summer holiday narrowboating in the UK. Well, it was the year to stay in Britain, what with the Olympics and the Jubilee.

Having just moved back to the north of England, I was especially pleased to hear that Yorkshire had beaten off Berlin and Amsterdam to\u00a0host the first two stages of the world&apos;s greatest bicycle race. It was satisfying proof, if needed, that the north is more than capable of continental sophistication. We may not have an Ottolenghi yet (come on, Yotam!), but Buttertubs Pass and Holme Moss will soon have their own entries in the Tour&apos;s history. Unlike Muswell Hill. I spent February and March desperately waiting for the ground to thaw so that I could recce some of the route without sacrificing a few toes. Finally, on Easter Sunday, the air seemed just about warm enough to risk it, and so we set off for Harrogate. Come 5 July next year, whoever wins in the chi-chi spa town will be the first wearer of the 2014 yellow jersey. To mimic Tour conditions, I should have been on a full carbon dream machine in a streamlined body suit. Instead, I was wearing thermals and an anorak, astride the Eastway ST 1.0, a steel-framed turquoise beauty better equipped for cycling to work than apeing le Tour de Yorkshire. It has built-in mudguards, for starters, and chunky tyres designed not to get a puncture when you cycle past a rough pub after a heavy night of bottling. But it looks good, getting the all-important nod of approval from my friend Mark, a single-speed poser who disdains hipsters despite patently being one. The makers, St Albans-based Fisher, get extra cool points for the brand name, which is inspired by the old road racing circuit now buried under London&apos;s Olympic park. Heading up and out towards Ripon, I got a little stuck with the gears, operated by pricey SRAM Apex shifters. These, I eventually learned, require a double tap in order to reverse the gear strength \u2013 ie, if you want to go down a gear and you&apos;ve previously gone up a gear, you tap the lever twice. Great for those of us with small hands and short arms, because you don&apos;t have to strain to shift the chain on to\u00a0another chain wheel as you do with Shimano. I also developed a bit of a thing for the bar tape, a luxuriant, velvety, black fabric that was a joy to hold. It is not a fast bike \u2013 no one in the peloton will be riding it through Yorkshire in 2014 \u2013 but if you&apos;re looking for an all-weather, all-round bike that won&apos;t let you down on the way to work or on a weekend spin, the Eastway is worth a look.

Tying in with her 75th birthday, the abdication and coronation in Amsterdam\u2019s central square will be cause for celebration and ceremony across the Netherlands with the Dutch throwing street parties and parades. We\u2019re keen to see your images and videos of the celebrations - whether in Holland or beyond - from national costumes to impromptu spates of orange-clad dancing to document what is likely to be one of the biggest celebrations of all things Dutch this century. To take part simply download the GuardianWitness app or use the desktop site to share your image or video. Approved photos will appear on the GuardianWitness assignment and we\u2019ll select the best and post them here. We also asked Dutch readers for their thoughts of the abdication and please leave your in the comment thread. Marije Haasnoot, 20, Katwijk aan Zee, The Netherlands On the 28 January our Queen Beatrix announced her abdication. I watched her speech together with my grandparents and felt slightly shocked. She had been our queen for 33 years and \u2013 though I hadn\u2019t expected it \u2013 knowing that we had to say goodbye to her now, made me feel quite emotional. Yet after my emotions settled down, I realised 2013 was going to be a very special year for the Netherlands and I have barely been able to contain my excitement over the past few months. A coronation \u2013 though technically in Holland it\u2019s an inauguration \u2013 of a new king is something that happens only once, twice or, if you\u2019re lucky, three times in your lifetime. It\u2019s an event of great historical importance and everyone in the Netherlands seems to realise that. Most of the Dutch people \u2013 as various polls have shown \u2013 support our king-to-be Willem-Alexander and are genuinely excited for 30 April. This is illustrated by the \u201corange madness\u201d that has taken over our newspapers, television shows, shops and minds. Most of us can\u2019t wait for the 30 April to arrive, because if there is one thing the Dutch know, it\u2019s how to throw a good party! Especially if we\u2019re allowed to dress up in orange! Lars Pasveer, Utrecht near Amsterdam, The Netherlands From the moment Queen Beatrix announced her abdication in January, the Netherlands slowly turned orange. It\u2019s inescapable: advertising becomes openly royalist, papers produce countless coronation specials, television starts favoring the new king over reports on violence in Syria. The constitutional monarchy in the 21st century is an odd beast. Succession is fundamentally undemocratic. Exit the right womb and - in the case of the new Dutch king - you receive 850.000 euros per annum. That\u2019s over two Obama\u2019s. We also constitutionally prevent you paying taxes on them. With the final Koninginnedag or Queen\u2019s Day upon us this Tuesday, I should confess I do go out with friends on that day. The party often starts the night before, because it\u2019s no secret Koninginnenacht is even better. The Netherlands lacks a strong nationalist tradition. During the year, it\u2019s rare to see the Dutch flag in everyday life. Municipal buildings only carry a flag on some - not all - national holidays. Nobody flags daily out of national pride. Of course there are occasional flourishes of orange when our national soccer team progresses - and ultimately fails - in European and international tournaments. Even as a softcore republican I recognise some benefits of our monarchy. Koninginnedag especially is an inclusive, uniquely carefree orange-hued celebration of \u2018Dutchness\u2019, without dark undercurrents of nationalism. It naturally centers around the pampered head that wears a crown, but for most people it\u2019s just a day to enjoy with friends, sell attic trash on the vrijmarkt and get drunk. As nationalism goes, you could do worse. Looking back, Beatrix as a symbol probably helped maintain this healthy form of nationalism, in a way a president possibly couldn\u2019t. But I wouldn\u2019t be a real Dutchman if I didn\u2019t grumble about the cost. Share your view in a comment.

Despite her huge popularity, the 75-year old queen, who has reigned for 33 years, announced earlier this year that she would step down after 33 years on the throne, following a tradition set by her mother and grandmother, who also abdicated. Alongside the inauguration ceremony for Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, Amsterdam is bracing itself for the biggest party in living memory: 30\u00a0April is a national annual holiday known as Queen&apos;s Day, and is already renowned for its lively street parties and orange costumes. Marc van der Linden, chief editor of Royalty magazine, said: &quot;It will be chaos, but we Dutch like some chaos. It means it is going to be a real party as well.&quot; Security measures for an influx of visitors equal to, or even greater than, Amsterdam&apos;s population include 10,000 uniformed police, 3,000 plainclothes officers and 1,500 &quot;spotters&quot;, who will work with police to identify troublemakers in the crowd. The airspace above Amsterdam was closed on Monday for three days. The precautions follow an attack on the royal family during Queen&apos;s Day celebrations in Apeldoorn in 2009, when a Dutch man, Karst Tates, drove his car at the royal parade, killing seven bystanders and himself. Dutch republicans have been given permission by police to protest at specific locations. Held at the royal palace, the abdication will be a private affair. In contrast, Willem-Alexander&apos;s investiture will take place in the Nieuwe Kerk church in Amsterdam&apos;s central Dam square. Two thousand guests, including 500 selected members of the public, will witness the new king swearing allegiance to the constitution of the Netherlands before the Dutch parliament. Members of the government in turn \u2013 minus a few dissenters \u2013 will swear oaths to the inviolability of the king. Other monarchies will be represented by crown princes and princesses from the UK, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Thailand and Japan. After the ceremony and reception, the new king and queen will watch a performance of Koningslied (The King&apos;s Song) by a choir in Rotterdam. This much-publicised paean, written with input from people across the Netherlands, has been savaged in the press and social media for heartfelt lines such as: &quot;I will build a dyke with my bare hands and keep you safe from the water.&quot; The pop song&apos;s composer, John Ewbank, was so stung by the criticism that he attempted unsuccessfully to have the song withdrawn from the day&apos;s festivities. The inauguration will give Willem-Alexander the opportunity to shake off a less regal image born of his student days, when his nickname, Prince Pils, hinted at a fondness for pilsner beer. In 2009 he was also heavily criticised for an ill-timed decision to invest in a luxurious holiday home in Mozambique while the Netherlands struggled with recession. In a televised interview last week, Willem-Alexander spoke of his time as crown prince as a period of training, adding: &quot;But now I am really ready to take over from my mother.&quot; It is his wife, Argentinian-born M\u00e1xima, who is seen by many royal commentators as key to the new king&apos;s appeal. Van der Linden said: &quot;This country is used to women. Since 1890, it&apos;s been queens. So Queen M\u00e1xima is going to be a major player.

There was the world&apos;s biggest flea market for a day. Mobile music systems blasting out from bicycles. It all happened in a 17th century Golden Age church. But it was a secular, not a religious ceremony, solemn but not trying to confer mystique. Very Dutch. Very Amsterdam. The day Crown Prince Willem-Alexander became King of The Netherlands. The 46-year-old redhead was enthroned as the first Dutch king since the 19th century on Tuesday amid just enough pomp and circumstance for the entire population watching on TV or on the giant screens erected across the squares of Holland. But the ceremonials were also very Dutch: sober, pragmatic and, in a sense, conditional as Queen Beatrix returned to her previous status as a princess and the first Dutch king since 1890 swore himself in before people he described as &quot;citizens&quot;, not &quot;subjects.&quot; Beatrix abdicated \u2013 uniquely among Europe&apos;s royal houses it has become the tradition in The Netherlands \u2013 on her 75th birthday, ending a 33-year reign, and passing the torch to one of her three sons, at a stroke rejuvenating the ageing stock of Europe&apos;s crowned heads. Except that King Willem-Alexander, in another peculiarly Dutch tradition, is not a crowned head at all. This was no coronation, rather an investiture or an inauguration, almost republican with some red ermine attached. The crown sat on a table in front of him in the 17th century church. It is never worn. Decked out completely in orange from his wig to his shoelaces and waving a Dutch flag, Karel Knispel appeared every inch the ardent monarchist. But amid the street parties, the ubiquitous celebrations and the huge, sometimes impassable crowds in Amsterdam, appearances could deceive. &quot;I like the tradition that on one day every year everyone is united in the same colour. That&apos;s a good principle,&quot; said the 46-year-old from Arnhem, adding that as a little boy, on the monarch&apos;s birthday he would cover his bicycle in orange crepe paper. &quot;Orange is a good colour for this, a friendly colour. But this is not about the monarchy; it&apos;s about uniting everyone. I&apos;m not a monarchist. And I hope Willem-Alexander doesn&apos;t interfere in politics like his mother did.&quot; It was a common sentiment on a joyous, if grey and blustery day. &quot;I&apos;ve got nothing against him if he does a good job,&quot; said Wout Van Bavel, a retired businessman in the obligatory orange pullover and shirt. &quot;I don&apos;t mind the monarchy. But I wouldn&apos;t mind also if it wasn&apos;t there.&quot; The new king and Maxima, his Argentinian former New York banker wife, struck the right note of modesty and sureness in what is the bi-centennial of the House of Orange. &quot;For the course of two centuries, the Dutch royal house has been linked with parliamentary democracy,&quot; Willem-Alexander said. There were no archbishops nor cardinals nor Calvinist elders presiding over the events in the 17th century New Church beside the royal palace in the centre of Amsterdam. Instead, it was the politicians who took centre stage, the assembled elected members of the first (upper) and second (lower) chambers of parliament in The Hague. Individually, they stood to declare their loyalty to the throne or to profess their monarchical agnosticism. The latter included Geert Wilders, the rightwing populist who has been the anti-Islam, anti-immigration, anti-EU scourge of Dutch politics for the past few years. Outside, if you paid a euro, you could throw eggs at a Wilders&apos;s face, alongside the stallholders peddling 10-euro orange T-shirts with Will and Maxima depicted as the king and queen of hearts. They reported business was booming, but despite the boisterous determination to have a good time on the national holiday, the Dutch evinced little sense of unlimited devotion to the newcomer to the throne. If he does a good job, fine; if he doesn&apos;t, we&apos;ll see, was the commonsense verdict. &quot;I never really saw him as a king, and I don&apos;t even know if I&apos;m a monarchist&quot; admitted Paul Van De Grampel, a financier in the City of London who took a snap decision on Tuesday morning to rush home for the big day. He attended school and university with the king and knows his two brothers, too. &quot;He is very down-to-earth, has really matured,&quot; he said. &quot;In the past 10 years, he has become a much more balanced person. And Maxima&apos;s just great. She&apos;s giving a real shine to the whole family.&quot; Willem-Alexander did not wear a crown, but many people did, plastic orange inflatable crowns, turning the city of Amsterdam into one giant car-boot sale on an urban scale. It seemed that every pavement in the city was converted into a flea market. Parents emptied their children&apos;s toy cupboards on to the streets and put everything up for sale. Secondhand clothes fluttered in the breeze. Crockery, CDs, creaky furniture and old kitchen gadgetry made it hard to navigate the pavements. Everyone was selling something. Because on the queen&apos;s birthday, and next year on the new king&apos;s birthday, April 27, you are allowed to put anything on the street and sell it. The only day of the year this is allowed. &quot;We&apos;re free to sell anything today,&quot; said Van Bavel offering an old pair of candlesticks and an unwanted picture frame. &quot;The other 364 days of the year it&apos;s not allowed.

Even the Portuguese&apos;s canny ability to hog the limelight from afar in a week when Chelsea can reach a third European final in six years merely prompted an &quot;each manager has his way [of behaving]&quot; from the Spaniard. The interim manager understandably appeared rather annoyed by it all, frustrated that the issue of Mourinho&apos;s potential return to Stamford Bridge in the summer could permeate the stadium&apos;s Harris Suite ahead of a Europa League semi-final. After all, Ben\u00edtez had his own message to impart. Chelsea impressed in last week&apos;s away leg at St Jakob-Park to carry a lead into Thursday&apos;s return, and the odds are stacked on their progress to the final in Amsterdam given that their opponents have not prevailed in nine previous visits to England, but this tie remains on edge. &quot;We have an opportunity but my concern is that we will be thinking we are in the final,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez, as if attempting to douse any presumption of progress. &quot;It&apos;s not the case. We play against a very good team, a team who have scored goals away from home, so everyone has to realise it will be tough, difficult. Hopefully I will be wrong and we will score a lot of goals and go through. But I think they will come and try and score, like they did at Tottenham Hotspur [in the quarter-finals]. &quot;They will be offensive, they will push. That&apos;s the only way they can qualify. I am concerned but I&apos;m not afraid. We know they are a dangerous team. They&apos;re quite strong, can score goals away, but we know we are so close to the final. We have to be focused and make sure we don&apos;t make mistakes but I have a lot of confidence in my players. We cannot think about lifting the trophy yet. First of all we have to win. After, we can think about the final.&quot; Such wariness is justified. Basel scored three at Old Trafford last season and had stretched Spurs, the excellence of their wingers Mohamed Salah and Valentin Stocker forcing Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas&apos;s side to play catch-up in the tie. Chelsea&apos;s considerable achievement on the banks of the Rhine last week was in nullifying the Swiss club&apos;s attacking threat, even if Stocker grew into the contest and ended up winning the dubious penalty that offers the visitors their hope. Ramires and Victor Moses had worked prodigiously that night to blunt their approach, but the former sustained a knock against Swansea City on Sunday and carries a caution into this return. Ben\u00edtez may have to find other ways to deflect the threat.     Juan Mata, left, shares a joke with Rafael Ben\u00edtez after Chelsea's interim manager was asked a question about the future of the club. Photograph: Christopher Lee/Getty Images    At least the Spaniard appears to have impressed upon his players the need to guard against complacency. &quot;Dangerous&quot; became the buzzword once it was clear Mourinho was off-limits. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a dangerous game,&quot; offered Juan Mata. &quot;Even if we&apos;ve scored two goals away and got a great result, it&apos;s the kind of game that can be very risky for ourselves. If we don&apos;t go into the game thinking about defending well and winning again, it&apos;ll be difficult. We know this. We&apos;ll know it today, and we&apos;ll know it tomorrow.&quot; Basel&apos;s coach, Murat Yakin, suggested his side needed &quot;a small miracle&quot; to progress, but Chelsea will be in no mood to offer one. Mata has been integral in driving Chelsea on this season, with Thursday night potentially a 124th game in two seasons for club and country, yet the motivation to claim a tangible reward from a campaign of eight competitions and two managers is clear. This will conclude the London club&apos;s fourth semi-final this term, with only their meeting with Monterrey in the Fifa Club World Cup having yielded progress into a final to date. The priority may remain Champions League qualification, but the Europa League does represent the opportunity Ben\u00edtez suggested. &quot;Every time I&apos;ve watched a game on the television in the Champions League, it&apos;s felt like such a shame,&quot; added Mata. &quot;So now I&apos;d rather be positive. We have a chance to win another big trophy, as we did last season. Rafa is a manager who did great seasons at every club he&apos;s been at. Since he came here, he&apos;s just tried to do his best: being with the team; analysing the rivals; getting ready for every game; doing his best for the team. &quot;For me and the players, he&apos;s a great manager. We are now trying to be in third position and having a chance to win a trophy, so maybe the season in the end will look good for us, and maybe for Rafa.

His yellows, his blues, his cherry trees and sunflowers and skies all created through thickly impastoed smears of chromatic splendour have made the very name Van Gogh synonymous with intense expressive colour. Yet some of the colours we see in Van Gogh&apos;s paintings are just pale echoes of the hues he originally set down in the 1880s. This startling discovery has just been revealed by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. A research project undertaken by the museum reveals that a number of Van Gogh&apos;s favourite paints have faded badly and changed the appearance of his works, making them milder, more empty, less exquisite in their use of complementary colours than they were when he painted them. The evidence is presented in Van Gogh at Work, a new exhibition at this popular and intellectually rigorous museum examining his practice as a painter, and looking at everything from the kinds of canvas he used \u2013 Van Gogh painted on everything from raw jute to, when he was short of cash, a dishcloth \u2013 to his intimate exchanges of ideas with friends such as Gauguin and Toulouse-Lautrec. The friendship with Toulouse-Lautrec is a touching example of how a physical examination of art can lead us closer to the artist. Van Gogh knew the great painter of Montmartre nightlife when they both lived in Paris, but evidence presented here, including the fact that they bought their canvases at the same shop, shows them working closely as colleagues. Another intimate revelation about Van Gogh&apos;s working habits is that he regularly reused his canvases, painting over early works. A flower painting in the show has a painting of wrestlers by Van Gogh concealed under it. When he wanted to keep a painting, he sometimes painted on the back: two brown studies for his early work The Potato Eaters have later, vibrant self-portraits on their reverse. Amid all this insight, the fact that Van Gogh&apos;s colours are not always in their pristine glory is hard to assimilate. The evidence is relentless. This exhibition is in effect a public report on a massive research project using the latest, non-invasive techniques to study the microscopic structure of art. You can even look through an electronic microscope for yourself in an interactive that lets you see the grains of dirt in Van Gogh&apos;s rich strokes of oily colour. In the end, the fact that some of Van Gogh&apos;s colours have changed over the years is simply a homage to his genius. No one, after all, has any complaint about his colours. In this exhibition, I stood enraptured by the deep blue sky and golden street in his 1888 painting The Yellow House. It doesn&apos;t matter, for most of us, if there are changes in his colours. His visionary art is such that it can evolve and still be true to itself. The fresh insights in this brilliant exhibition, which includes a loan of Van Gogh&apos;s Sunflowers, no less, from London&apos;s National Gallery, do not undermine the artist&apos;s greatness. They just bring us closer to him, as we stand at his shoulder, watching him work \u2013 until we are really close, in a fresh, invigorating way, to his material life as an artist. It even includes his palette, smeared with colours, and three tubes of paint that belonged to him. They are exhibited next to his self-portrait.

Their place in the Europa League final had been confirmed and, however much a downgrade it is compared with last season&apos;s glories, they will cherish the opportunity to bring another trophy back to Stamford Bridge at the end of a difficult, sometimes chaotic season. They had kept their nerve even when Basel took the lead at the end of the first half to engulf the stadium with a sense of foreboding. Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s players cleared their heads during the break and their response in the second half was reminiscent of those intoxicating Champions League nights when they simply refused to bend. It brought them three goals in the space of nine minutes and the third, from David Luiz, will be remembered as one of the more stunning finishes Stamford Bridge has witnessed for some time. Over the two legs they had deserved to go through and, though it is a strange mix of politics at this club, Ben\u00edtez will probably not be too offended that a date against Benfica in Amsterdam on 15 May had been booked and it was the name of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho that was being sung. The serenading began from the Matthew Harding stand inside the first few minutes and, for long spells, it was the soundtrack to the night. &quot;Jos\u00e9&apos;s coming home,&quot; they sang. The message was loud and clear but at least from Ben\u00edtez&apos;s perspective the mood is very different from the mutinies he encountered earlier in the season. An unofficial ceasefire has been called and, however unfashionable it might be in these parts to offer Ben\u00edtez any credence, he probably deserves some slack.     David Luiz celebrates after scoring Chelsea's third goal in the Europa Cup semi-final second leg against Basel.  Photograph: Scott Heavey/Getty Images    The only slight disappointment for Chelsea&apos;s supporters was that Frank Lampard could not equal Bobby Tambling&apos;s record of 202 goals for the club. Lampard hit the post early on, fired in the shot that led to Fernando Torres scoring the equaliser and, maybe trying a little too hard, put a late free-kick into the stand as the crowd implored him to add to the sense of occasion. Overall, however, it constituted a satisfying evening, not least as Chelsea managed to win without the torn emotions of losing anyone for the final for totting up too many yellow cards. Roberto Di Matteo was deprived of four players for the Champions League final against Bayern Munich last May. The same number were vulnerable here but Ben\u00edtez sensibly substituted David Luiz and Ramires. Ryan Bertrand avoided the dreaded booking and the fourth player, Mikel John Obi, was not involved at all. Benfica are refined opponents but, with a full squad, Chelsea will fancy their chances. They had begun like a team in a hurry but their wayward finishing \u2013 one effort from Torres went out for a throw-in, reminiscent of a golfer slicing on to the wrong fairway \u2013 encouraged Basel to come back at them before half-time, culminating in Mohamed Salah opening the scoring. The Swiss champions had been growing in confidence but it was a bad goal to concede, stemming from a basic inability to hold a defensive line. Valentin Stocker&apos;s pass was beautifully weighted and Salah ran off Branislav Ivanovic to clip a left-foot shot past Petr Cech. At half-time Chelsea&apos;s supporters might have been forgiven for bracing themselves for a nerve-shredding 45 minutes. Instead, the team&apos;s response was hugely impressive. Eden Hazard, in particular, was tremendous, always willing to carry the ball forward, displaying some lovely touches and playing with the cutting edge that justified Ben\u00edtez&apos;s decision to start with Juan Mata on the bench, keeping the Spaniard back for Sunday&apos;s game at Manchester United. Hazard was instrumental in the equaliser, collecting the ball just inside the Basel half and then bursting between two players and accelerating away. His speed and movement took him beyond another challenge and when he was tackled the ball broke to Lampard just outside the penalty area. Yann Sommer, the Basel goalkeeper, kept out Lampard&apos;s left-foot drive but Torres was following up and first to the rebound. A sense of relief lifted the tension that had built during the interval and two minutes later the game swung decisively in Chelsea&apos;s favour as Moses surged infield from the left, played it to Torres and continued his own run into the penalty area. Torres scuffed his shot but the ball broke kindly for Moses. Fabian Sch\u00e4r smothered the first attempt but Moses made no mistake when the ball popped up for him to have a second crack. Suddenly it was as if Chelsea had been shed of inhibition. David Luiz&apos;s goal deserves all the superlatives that will come with it: a dipping, curling left-foot effort into the top corner from Lampard&apos;s layoff 25 yards out. The shot was a combination of swerve, audacity and expertise but no one should be too surprised. A few moments earlier, he had tried to catch Sommer off his line by lofting a shot from his own half that was only a foot or so too high. Chelsea had played with great confidence and the Brazilian, in his new midfield role, had scored a goal to grace the occasion.", "sentences": ["Over the two legs they had deserved to go through and, though it is a strange mix of politics at this club, Ben\u00edtez will probably not be too offended that a date against Benfica in Amsterdam on 15 May had been booked and it was the name of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho that was being sung."], "title": "Chelsea 3-1 Basel (agg 5-2) | Europa League semi-final second leg match report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/02/chelsea-basel-europa-league-report", "tags": ["Europa League", "Chelsea", "Basel", "Football", "Sport", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-02T21:12:48Z", "article": "1 A reaction to Champions League elimination   This was not how it was supposed to be. Chelsea had begun this campaign with seven trophies on offer, and the defence of the European Cup high on their list of priorities. Yet Roberto Di Matteo&apos;s tenure had petered out with the team on the verge of elimination and that disappointment still stings even now. &quot;Every time I watch a Champions League game on television, I think it&apos;s a shame,&quot; said Juan Mata, expressing the angst of an entire squad. Yet while the Europa League was a consolation prize, it now offers the season the possibility of a silver lining. Chelsea have been playing for pride, with that failure in the elite competition spurring them on. Victory against Benfica at the Amsterdam Arena on 15 May would provide the reward they have craved. 2 Some luck of the draw The standard of opposition confronted by the reigning European champions was unlikely to leave them quaking in their boots. This club saw off Napoli, Benfica, Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the Champions League knockout phase last season. Sparta Prague, Steaua Bucharest, Rubin Kazan and FC Basel are not quite as daunting. They avoided Benfica, Zenit St Petersburg, Anzhi Makhachkala and Internazionale, and even the other English sides. Rubin might have been more awkward had the game been staged in Kazan but there was a blizzard on the day Uefa&apos;s inspectors visited the Tsentralnyi Stadium and the match was switched to Moscow. Basel had impressed against Spurs but they wilted when Chelsea upped their rhythm after the break and have now failed to win in 10 trips to England. 3 Their home form has carried them through   Even so, with Chelsea&apos;s away form in Europe patchy at best, there has been the occasional pang of anxiety en route only for their strength at home to prevail. When a deficit had to be retrieved against Steaua, Chelsea rallied and eventually prevailed with something to spare. Rubin were deflated in London, and the Swiss eventually subdued. This was a 13th game at Stamford Bridge in Uefa competition without defeat, a sequence that stretches back to Manchester United&apos;s visit in the Champions League quarter-finals two years and three managers ago. Basel&apos;s goal on the stroke of half-time was a shock to the system but it only stung the hosts into life in breathtaking fashion. 4 The Ben\u00edtez factor   The locals may prefer not to acknowledge it, or even point to a perceived selfish motivation to garnish his CV, but Rafael Ben\u00edtez has helped smooth this progress. The interim first-team manager&apos;s canny juggling of his squad has maintained advancement through the slog. This was game No64 of the season and, even if the side meandered before the break, he still coaxed a reaction from his players thereafter. Perhaps that was to be expected. Ben\u00edtez has tended to rely on his seasoned European players for this competition. John Terry may have dropped to the bench, but Frank Lampard (116 games), Fernando Torres (64), David Luiz (53), Branislav Ivanovic (58) and Petr Cech (106) boast weighty experience on this stage. It is as if Chelsea&apos;s Premier League lineup offer a glimpse of the future while the European selection rekindles some of the spirit of Bar\u00e7a and Munich last term. 5 And those old campaigners have excelled   Ben\u00edtez has been able to rely on those older heads. Cech&apos;s save from Mohamed Salah just before the interval here was just the latest reminder of his qualities. Lampard was all hustle and bustle, striking a post as he trundled into familiar offensive territory, while the Brazilians David Luiz and Ramires were energetic and committed despite hovering a booking away from suspension. David Luiz, a goalscorer, continues to defy belief. Torres, too, should not be ignored. The Spaniard was deeply frustrating at times but still sprung on to the rebound when Yann Sommer could only push out Lampard&apos;s shot. That was his fifth goal in eight appearances in the Europa League. He has relished this competition.", "sentences": ["Victory against Benfica at the Amsterdam Arena on 15 May would provide the reward they have craved."], "title": "Five reasons why Chelsea have reached the Europa League final | Dominic Fifield", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/02/chelsea-europa-league-final-five-reasons", "tags": ["Europa League", "Chelsea", "Football", "Sport", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-02T23:25:55Z", "article": "With smoke from the Basel fans&apos; flares drifting across an unusually lush Stamford Bridge pitch, and with Chelsea&apos;s appearance in the Europa League final confirmed with half an hour of this semi-final second leg remaining, it was possible to detect a peculiar feeling swirling around a stadium that has endured an unusually fraught six months, even by the unusually fraught standards of the Roman Abramovich approach to long-term harmony. Unfamiliar but strangely uplifting: it might even have been something close to happiness on a night of Chelsea triumph marked as ever by a sense of imminent arrivals and departures. Poor old Rafa Ben\u00edtez, menaced at both ends of his interim reign by the sound of voices off. In the autumn it was those chants of &quot;One Di Matteo&quot;. Here, as Chelsea struggled for 50 minutes to land a decisive glove on a spunky Basel team, it was the whispered return of the one before the one before the one before, as Chelsea&apos;s fans took pleasure in serenading Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 the manager of Real Madrid, and a man with whom Ben\u00edtez in his most sweatily cherished homecoming fantasies perhaps dreams of swapping jobs. What does Ben\u00edtez have to do to get a shout out around here? If the abuse from the stands has dwindled to a lull, it appears that guiding the club towards the opportunity to win its fourth European trophy is still not enough to earn even the grudging favour of the Chelsea fans. Not that Ben\u00edtez will mind particularly: such is the bizarre and unsustainable narrative of conjoined interests at Stamford Bridge that his chief personal focus will surely have turned towards a high-visibility opportunity to win a fourth Uefa trophy of his own. For Chelsea&apos;s hierarchy the goal will remain fourth place in the Premier League. Specifics of the manager&apos;s team rotation policy from here on in will make fascinating reading. Either way, in Chelsea and fellow finalists Benfica we now have a final between two teams who did not want to be in the competition in the first place, one of whom is managed by a man basically playing for his own reputation. It is a glorious muddle of competing interests, albeit as three sides of Stamford Bridge bounced to One Step Beyond there was a sense above it all that Chelsea&apos;s fans will simply be happy for the chance to hold, for 10 days only, both of Uefa&apos;s major trophies. There was perhaps just a single minor chord as Frank Lampard, scoreless in his pursuit of Bobby Tambling&apos;s goal record, trudged off at the end with an extended wave to all four corners. If Lampard really is leaving Stamford Bridge he has only two more home games: feed in rotation and substitution, he might even have played his last 90 minutes here. If there is an added sense of tension to Lampard&apos;s pursuit of that 43-year-old record it is simply that it chimes with a wider sense of endings and last things. They are a team who have already been partially renovated with the bolting on of its fluid and youthful attacking midfield tripod, represented here by Eden Hazard, who was again superbly mobile as the centre of an attacking trio alongside Victor Moses and Ramires. The first chants for Mourinho began to ring around the ground as early as the ninth minute, as Lampard and David Luiz began to exert a nonchalant kind of grip on midfield. Quite what Mourinho would make of the Fulham Broadway Socrates, occasionally loopy, always grippingly watchable, is anybody&apos;s guess. Lampard, though, remains prone to moments of match-turning influence and it was from his shot in the 50th minute, palmed out by Yann Sommer, that Fernando Torres scored a goal to settle the nerves after Basel had taken the lead at the end of the first half. Chelsea&apos;s players celebrated hungrily as the Bridge began to bubble with a sense of ambient pre-final glee. And not before time too. The Premier League&apos;s belittling of the Europa League is entirely misplaced. This is a grand old trophy, regardless of the tangle of a format. More than this, it is a sniffiness that is entirely unearned: for all the Champions League highs, Liverpool are the only English winners of Europe&apos;s second trophy in the last 29 winners. Chelsea&apos;s third goal just before the hour mark provided a tangible sense of release on a night when, for the first time, it was possible to glimpse some kind of mutual happy ending in what has been a wretchedly noxious interlude. Lampard&apos;s nudged pass was perfectly weighted for David Luiz to spank an outrageously swerved shot that bulged, and indeed threatened to remove, the top corner of the net. Chelsea and Ben\u00edtez, fellow travellers in one of football&apos;s oddest of odd-couple pairings, will now take their semi-mutual interests to Amsterdam for the final on 15 May, four days before a potentially decisive final Premier League fixture against Everton. Take Chelsea home on both fronts and Ben\u00edtez may yet earn the silent thanks \u2013 if never, it seems, the affection \u2013 of a set of supporters whose eyes are already elsewhere.", "sentences": ["Chelsea and Ben\u00edtez, fellow travellers in one of football&apos;s oddest of odd-couple pairings, will now take their semi-mutual interests to Amsterdam for the final on 15 May, four days before a potentially decisive final Premier League fixture against Everton."], "title": "Rafa Ben\u00edtez on a mission but Chelsea dream of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho | Barney Ronay", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/03/rafa-benitez-chelsea-jose-mourinho", "tags": ["Rafael Ben\u00edtez", "Chelsea", "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-02T23:40:04Z", "article": "     Rafael Ben\u00edtez insisted he deserves the respect of Chelsea&apos;s sceptical support after his team&apos;s blistering second-half revival propelled them to the Europa League final at Basel&apos;s expense. Three goals in nine minutes after the interval, the third a stunning shot from distance from David Luiz, hauled Chelsea from behind to win 3-1 on the night and 5-2 on aggregate to secure a meeting with Benfica at the Amsterdam ArenA on 15 May. That will be the 10th major final of the Roman Abramovich era, and an opportunity to claim an 11th major trophy in the decade since the oligarch purchased the club, as Chelsea seek to become the first club to follow up a European Cup triumph by claiming the Europa League. The home support chorused Roberto Di Matteo, who was sacked by Abramovich in November, and bellowed Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s name as Ben\u00edtez oversaw this victory as a reminder that the Spaniard will never be accepted by those in the stands. Asked if he merited the respect of the support, the interim manager said: &quot;We&apos;re doing our jobs as professionals. Since that &apos;talk&apos; at Middlesbrough [when he had openly criticised the fans] I think we&apos;ve won 11 of 13 games at home, which is quite good. We are doing our job. Hopefully a lot of the fans will appreciate that. &quot;It&apos;s not just about me. It&apos;s about the players, the staff, the fans, the club, everyone. I was helping the team. As a manager you have to do your job. With all the circumstances that were around at the beginning \u2013 the situation with the squad, being without [the cup-tied] Demba Ba, a team in transition \u2013 we&apos;ve done a good job. &quot;We were professional trying to improve things without much time, because we&apos;ve been playing twice a week, and we did well. Hopefully we can finish even better. The players deserve to be there. It&apos;s an opportunity for the club. It&apos;ll be tough because Benfica are a really good team and hard to play against, but at least we are there. With the commitment and the quality, we&apos;ll have a chance for sure.&quot; Chelsea and Benfica will receive only 9,800 tickets each from Uefa for the final in the 53,000-capacity stadium in Amsterdam, where David Luiz and Ramires \u2013 who each avoided the caution that would have seen them banned for the showpiece \u2013 will confront their former club. Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich will have 25,000 each at Wembley for this year&apos;s Champions League final, and the London club officially had 17,500 tickets for last May&apos;s version at the Allianz Arena. They had beaten the Portuguese side 3-1 on aggregate in the quarter-final en route to Bavaria, the clubs&apos; only meeting in European competition. It remains to be seen whether John Terry, who was rested here and missed last season&apos;s European Cup final in Munich through suspension, will be offered the chance to play this time around. Ben\u00edtez, who will compete in his fourth European final, was offering no guarantees on Thursday night. &quot;I don&apos;t know because we have too many games to play before,&quot; he said. &quot;The main thing for me is to enjoy today and be ready for the challenge of Manchester United [on Sunday] and then Tottenham Hotspur. &quot;It&apos;s important to show this character from now on in and keep winning. We have to keep the momentum going. Hopefully we can do it. United will be tough, Tottenham will be crucial for us in terms of reaching the top four.

There&apos;s always a catch. Borussia Dortmund might have enriched the soul with their freewheeling Champions League destruction of Real Madrid but their exploits are tinged with sadness, with the knowledge that what could be their greatest moment might not be the start of something great but an abrupt end to an era. Mario G\u00f6tze has already agreed to join Bayern Munich at the end of the season, Manchester City are trying to woo Marco Reus and various suitors are batting their eyelids at Robert Lewandowski. If you can&apos;t beat them, buy them. Morals? Forget morals. It&apos;s just business and, as they say, that&apos;s all football is these days, which is why we cherish \u2013 and later mourn \u2013 the sides that spring up out of nowhere and capture our imagination, who make it possible for little guys everywhere to dream that it could be them one day. It is why people speak so wistfully about Ajax&apos;s class of 95 and why they are always referenced in conversations about teams broken up before their time. Ajax, the club of Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff, are hardly the little guys in their own country. Yet outside of Holland, they shrink in comparison to the major European clubs, even though they have won more European Cups than Chelsea, Manchester United, Inter and Juventus. Their last triumph was 18 years ago. But what a triumph it was, a victory for the shrewd management of Louis van Gaal and a fertile youth system that produced the likes of Edgar Davids, the De Boer brothers, Patrick Kluivert and Clarence Seedorf. There was a mixture of youth and experience, with veterans such as Danny Blind and Frank Rijkaard guiding the youngsters. They were decidedly Dutch, too; of the team that started the final against Milan in Vienna, there were only two foreigners in the starting XI, the Nigerian winger, Finidi George, and the legendary Finland striker, Jari Litmanen, while Nwankwo Kanu came off the bench. This Ajax side were Champions League novices, having not appeared in the competition for four years. Yet despite being placed in the same group as Milan, who had thrashed Barcelona 4-0 in the previous season&apos;s final, they were not overawed by Fabio Capello&apos;s side. They beat them 2-0 home and away and even though they drew twice with Casino Salzburg, two wins over AEK Athens meant they finished unbeaten and top of the group. From there, Ajax beat Hajduk Split 3-0 on aggregate in the last eight to set up a semi-final against Bayern, who were managed by Giovanni Trapattoni. The first leg in Munich finished 0-0 but it was back at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam where the tie really took off. At half-time the Dutch violinist, Andr\u00e9 Rieu, led the crowd in a rendition of the Second Waltz and on the pitch there was perfect harmony, too. By the time Rieu took to the stage, Ajax were already 3-1 up. Litmanen had given them an early lead and although Marcel Witeczek equalised to briefly put Bayern in control, a crunching strike from Finidi quickly restored Ajax&apos;s advantage, before Ronald de Boer opened up a two-goal lead. Litmanen swiftly made it 4-1 after the restart and although Mehmet Scholl pulled one back from the penalty spot, Marc Overmars capped off the evening by scoring a fifth with two minutes left. On the same evening a 2-0 win for Milan against Paris Saint-Germain sealed their place in the final. Ajax had already beaten the European champions twice; now they had to do it when it mattered most and it felt appropriate that Kluivert, only 18, came off the bench to score the winner in the 85th minute. Having also won the Dutch league, Ajax continued to flourish, despite the sale of Seedorf to Sampdoria for \u00a31.5m and Rijkaard&apos;s retirement. The following season they reached the final, where they were up against Italian opposition once again. This time, though, they were beaten on penalties by Juventus after a 1-1 draw. They retained their league title but the cracks were beginning to show; Overmars, for instance, missed most of the season and Holland&apos;s miserable Euro 96 campaign with a bad knee injury. The Bosman ruling was disastrous for Ajax. That summer Davids and Michael Reiziger both joined Milan on free transfers; Kluivert followed them to San Siro a year later. Inter signed Kanu for \u00a31m. In 1997, Overmars left for Arsenal, playing a key role in their Double in the 1997-98 season. Although Ajax reached the semi-finals of the Champions League in 1997, losing to Juventus again, they slumped in the league, finishing fourth. &quot;The Bosman ruling means that not only do Ajax not get paid for some of the players they have nurtured since childhood, they now find Italian scouts haunting their youth team (Udinese recently signed a 19-year-old who had played only one game for the first team),&quot; wrote David Winner in March 1997, shortly before Ajax beat Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in their European Cup quarter-final. &quot;The loss of talent will continue this summer, starting with the brilliant but abrasive Van Gaal. &quot;Despite all their problems, Michael van Praag, the Ajax president, remains optimistic. &apos;Every year one or two big names leave. It is sad, especially for me. But we are used to it. There is absolutely no panic,&apos; he said. &quot;Ajax&apos;s annual budget is just over \u00a320m, which the club is trying to increase to \u00a3100m. It is a lot for the Netherlands, but small by comparison with Europe&apos;s giants. &apos;In southern Europe, clubs can lose millions of dollars every year and still buy players because they get money from I don&apos;t know where,&apos; Van Praag said. &apos;We don&apos;t think we will ever come to the same level as them budget-wise, but we try to narrow the gap. But we have something they do not have. Our school.&apos;&quot; Noble, admirable intentions but the school has not been enough in a world where money rules. Since 1997, Ajax have reached the knock-out stages of the Champions League twice, losing in the last eight to Milan in 2003 and in the last-16 to Inter in 2006. In 1995, Ajax, the champions of Europe, beat Real Madrid home and away in their group; when they play them now, they&apos;re lucky to get nil. JS 2) Red Star Belgrade You might think that the winners of the worst European Cup final anybody can remember surrendered their right to misty-eyed what-ifs the moment that Ljubomir Petrovic instructed his players to return the ball to Marseille at any and every opportunity, for fear of being caught on the counterattack. (Even Sinisa Mihajlovic himself later admitted that it was &quot;the most boring final match in European Cup history.&quot;) You might, but you would be mistaken. The side that beat Marseille \u2013 having also beaten Bayern Munich in the semi-final after a sashaying run through the tournament \u2013 was the product of five years of team building: Ilija Najdoski, Darko Pancev, Miodrag Belodedici, Vladimir Jugovic, Dejan Savicevic\u0107and Mihajlovic added to the 1988 league-winning squad already containing players such as Robert Prosinecki and Dragisa Binic (both signed in 1987) to give Red Star a league and cup double in 1990. The break up of the European Cup-winning side, in the midst of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, happened so quickly and so completely that within two years of the final the entire squad from that inglorious night in Bari, and the manager, were gone. Even by the time they contested the European Super Cup with the Cup Winners&apos; Cup winners, Manchester United, in November 1991, the team looked drastically different. In Behind the Curtain: Football in Eastern Europe, Jonathan Wilson recalls a conversation with Stevan Stojanovic, the goalkeeper who joined Red Star in 1982 and who captained the side to the European Cup. &quot;The tragedy is,&quot; Stojanovic says, &quot;we will never know how good we could have been.&quot; In Mihajlovic&apos;s version of events, Red Star sacrificed possession in the final not because they thought Marseille were better than them, but because of the differences in experience between the two sides. Marseille had been semi-finalists a year earlier, losing to Benfica on away goals, and reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winners&apos; Cup the year before that. Red Star were a younger side than the one that had taken Real Madrid so close in the 1986-87 quarter-finals, a &quot;squad full of 21, 22 and 23-year-old kids&quot;, as Mihajlovic put it. They were on the brink of greatness and could not afford to find out how well they might cope with having to come from behind in the club&apos;s first European Cup final; why should they trouble themselves with aesthetics? It was not as if they had not proved themselves over the course of the competition. In the first round, after a 1-1 home draw, Red Star clobbered Grasshoppers 4-1 away from home \u2013 a match watched by Walter Smith, scouting for second-round opponents Rangers, whose report back to the manager Graeme Souness was famously brief: &quot;We&apos;re fucked.&quot; Rangers duly travelled to Belgrade and took a 3-0 hiding, rendering their second-leg match a formality. &quot;Graeme Souness and his team retreated last night with tails tucked firmly between their legs,&quot; wrote Joe Lovejoy in the Independent, &quot;uncomfortably aware that if the Yugoslavs&apos; finishing had done justice to their technical expertise or had Chris Woods not been in heroic form, emphatic defeat would have become dire humiliation.&quot; Red Star&apos;s 6-0 aggregate quarter-final win over Dynamo Dresden is asterixed by the second-leg walkover forced by fan violence, but with little of the match remaining the Yugoslavs were on course for a 5-1 aggregate victory in any case. The first leg was over as a competition before an hour was up, with Prosinecki and Savicevic orchestrating things. All of the other potential semi-finalists \u2013 including Bayern, Porto, Spartak Moscow, Real Madrid, Milan and Marseille \u2013 wanted to avoid Red Star. Bayern were the ones to draw the short straw, falling to a 2-1 home defeat in the first leg despite taking the lead through Roland Wohlfarth midway through the second half. A trademark left-footed free-kick from Mihajlovic extended Red Star&apos;s lead in the second leg, in front of an 80,000-strong crowd at the Marakana, but Klaus Augenthaler and Manfred Bender levelled the scores in the second half. With extra-time looming, Augenthaler deflected a Mihajlovic ball past his own keeper to put Red Star through in the 90th minute. The trial of this match arguably fed in to Petrovic&apos;s gameplan for the final against Chris Waddle&apos;s Marseille, who had relatively little trouble seeing off Spartak Moscow in the other semi-final. There was also the small distraction of near-war at home \u2013 as one supporter put it, a win in the final would permit them to &quot;live normally for another three days.&quot; Though the end of the tournament was hugely anticlimactic, we should not forget the context, nor the glorious counterattacking football that Red Star had played up to that point: fast, powerful, unpredictable. Savicevic, popping up on both wings and just as difficult to handle on each, finished second in the voting for that season&apos;s Ballon d&apos;Or. The loss, eventually, of Savicevic, and others much sooner, was sadly inevitable; Yugoslav players left the league in droves as their earnings plummeted and the country was consumed by conflict. A gaggle of scouts took up seats at the final to watch Red Star&apos;s key players, and though &quot;they kept their gifts well hidden&quot;, as David Lacey put it in the Guardian&apos;s report, Prosinecki joined Real Madrid that summer, while Binic, signed only a year earlier, joined Slavia Prague. Stojanovic went to Royal Antwerp; the defender Refik Sabanadzovic to AEK Athens; Slobodan Marovic to Norrkoping. Still Red Star retained the Yugoslav First League title the following season, Pancev scoring 25 goals to outstrip Partizan, but come the following summer he too was gone, to Internazionale. Indeed, Serie A was a particular beneficiary of the breakdown of the Yugoslav league in 1992: Savicevic signed to Milan, Jugovic joined Sampdoria, and Mihajlovic went to Roma. Belodedici made off in the direction of La Liga and Valencia, while Najdoski joined Real Valladolid. GT 3) Leeds United The story of David O&apos;Leary&apos;s Leeds United &quot;babies&quot; is a story of optimism, youthful verve, hubris, violence, profligacy and financial nemesis. It is also the story of three teams and three managers with rival claims to paternity \u2013 Howard Wilkinson, the author of the 10-year plan in 1988 that brought promotion and the title to Elland Road, George Graham who took over in the autumn of 1996 and O&apos;Leary, Graham&apos;s assistant, who abandoned his predecessor&apos;s caution and placed his trust in the outstanding graduates of the 1997 FA Youth Cup winning side. Wilkinson deserves the credit for establishing the system and designing the facilities that nurtured Paul Robinson, Harry Kewell, Stephen McPhail, Matthew Jones, Alan Smith and Jonathan Woodgate and for buying Nigel Martyn and Lee Bowyer, Graham for recognising Lucas Radebe&apos;s leadership qualities and upgrading at centre-forward from the still crafty if physically antiquated Ian Rush to the thrillingly dynamic Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. O&apos;Leary then blooded Leeds&apos;s youngsters, most notably introducing Smith off the bench at Anfield to score with a carefree swank, and strengthened, at first, astutely. He knew how to tickle the support, making David Batty&apos;s return his first priority, then followed it with Eirik Bakke and used some of the \u00a312m Leeds reluctantly accepted for the sale of Hasselbaink to buy Michael Bridges, who had an outstanding first season as Leeds finished in third and secured a Champions League qualifying tie. Mark Viduka, Olivier Dacourt and Dominic Matteo were all signed in the summer of 2000 for the Champions League campaign and, when Kewell and Bridges were injured, Robbie Keane joined on loan. After making it through the first Champions League group round despite an opening-tie walloping by Barcelona, Leeds were bullish enough to pay West Ham United \u00a318m for Rio Ferdinand who was immediately appointed captain. It was only after Christmas that their league form clicked but in Europe they made it all the way to the semi-final, memorably defeating Lazio with a glorious Smith goal set up by Viduka&apos;s delicate backheel, overwhelming Anderlecht in Brussels and destroying Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a in the quarter-final at Elland Road before just surviving when the tables were turned in the second leg. Valencia won the semi-final convincingly enough and Leeds missed out on Champions League qualification by a point, still seething that a Wes Brown own goal in a 1-1 draw with Manchester United had been unreasonably disallowed. Twelve years on those fine margins, which could have made the difference to a reckless gamble paying off or leading to a dozen years of purgatory, still rankle. In truth, though, Peter Ridsdale&apos;s most ridiculous decision was his next one, borrowing \u00a360m in a bond and using part of it to pay Inter \u00a312m for Keane, Derby \u00a37m for Seth Johnson and Liverpool \u00a311m for Robbie Fowler. This wasn&apos;t so much going all-in as putting all your possessions and your very life on the line. And, as we know, it failed. Top of the Premier League on New Year&apos;s Day 2002, Leeds slumped alarmingly after defeat by Cardiff in the FA Cup and finished fifth with a dressing room acrimoniously torn over O&apos;Leary&apos;s book &quot;Leeds United on Trial&quot; whose title cashed in on the notoriety of the prosecution of Woodgate and Bowyer for affray and assault. Out went O&apos;Leary and in came Terry Venables, Leeds selling Ferdinand for \u00a330m in the summer to give them breathing space before panicking after Christmas and essentially paying Fowler to go. Newcastle exploited Leeds&apos;s desperation and bought Woodgate on the cheap, Kewell left for Liverpool at the end of the season and took a slice of the fee too before relegation the following season ushered on imminent financial catastrophe and the exodus of the remaining players for negligible sums. It has been portrayed as an Icarus-like football fable. Ambition took Leeds too close to the sun and those final purchases seared the wax. The fact is, though, as Wilkinson knew, Leeds never had the income to compete with Manchester United in the Premier League and did not have a wealthy benefactor to give it to them. So he tried to emulate them by producing his own players \u2013 and the spine of the team that won qualification to the Champions League in 2000 was his legacy. With careful husbandry and targeted investment it could have matured into a great one. But a dash for growth stimulated the board more than Wilkinson&apos;s sustainable model and demolished the club&apos;s credit-worthiness and credibility. The severely diminished club that remains is still paying the price. RB 4) Parma Parallel parking when people are looking. Public speaking. Running a marathon. Maintaining eye contact with the opposite sex. Maintaining eye contact with Roy Keane. These are all intimidating things to do. But none of them are anything like as intimidating as Serie A in the 90s. It was a league brimming over with talent. Juventus, Inter and Milan were naturally at the top of the food chain, but you had to take Roma and Lazio into account. Fiorentina had Gabriel Batistuta and Manuel Rui Costa. Sampdoria, Champions League finalists in 1992, had Roberto Mancini. And then there was Parma. It is probably not a name that will make younger people go weak at the knees. On a wider scale, Parma are largely inconsequential these days. But not then. Until their promotion to Serie A under Nevio Scala in 1990, they had spent much of their existence scrabbling around the lower divisions. Once they were in the top flight, though, the investment began, with the club backed by Calisto Tanzi&apos;s food company, Parmalat. In 1992, they won their first major honour, beating Juventus 2-1 on aggregate in the final of the Coppa Italia and a year later they beat Royal Antwerp 3-1 in the final of the Cup Winners&apos; Cup. They were on the map and it was a major surprise when they failed to retain their trophy a year later, beaten 1-0 by Arsenal in the final. Not to worry. With one European trophy under their belt, another soon followed as Juventus were prevented from adding the Uefa Cup to their league title in 1995. Parma had finished 10 points behind Marcello Lippi&apos;s side in the league, but won the first leg of the final 1-0 at home thanks to Dino Baggio&apos;s goal and then drew 1-1 in Turin, Baggio grabbing the vital goal again after Gianluca Vialli had put Juventus in front. For all their success in the cups, they could not quite crack the league though. They finished sixth in 1996 and Scala was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti but the emergence of Gianluigi Buffon and the arrivals of Lilian Thuram, Enrico Chiesa and Hernan Crespo that summer helped Parma maintain a title bid that ultimately ended in frustration. With three games left, they needed to beat Juventus to keep their hopes alive but although they took the lead through Zinedine Zidane&apos;s own goal, a highly contentious penalty from Nicola Amoruso was enough for Lippi&apos;s men. Although Juve drew their final two games and Parma won theirs, Ancelotti&apos;s side missed out by two points. The spending continued. In came the Argentinians, Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n and Ariel Ortega. A second Uefa Cup followed in 1999 with Marseille beaten 3-0 in the final. Yet it was unsustainable and by the turn of the century, the exodus had begun. In the space of a couple of years, Parma lost the likes of Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Thuram, Crespo, Baggio, Ortega and Ver\u00f3n, and in 2004 the club was declared insolvent after Parmalat went bankrupt following fraud by Tanzi, who was sentenced to 18 years in jail in 2010. Parma&apos;s glory years are a mere memory now. JS 5) Porto Evolution is not really Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s style. On his appointment in early 2002 he promised to take Porto, struggling to keep pace with the league leaders, immediately back to championship form. &quot;From here,&quot; he said in a letter in which he welcomed the squad to Porto, rather than the other way around, &quot;each practice, each game, each minute of your social life must centre on the aim of being champions.&quot; Having lifted the team to third in a few months (after January they lost only two matches), Mourinho set about constructing the side that would win the treble: Nuno Valente and Derlei, who played under him at Uni\u00e3o de Leiria; Benfica cast-off Maniche (as well as Edgaras Jankauskas); Paolo Ferreira, playing on the right for Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal, would become a flying full-back. He also brought Jorge Costa back into the squad, where Ricardo Carvalho, Deco and Costinha were already central to the new manager&apos;s plans. This team would take some beating: aggressive, fast-thinking \u2013 and, crucially, well organised. It was not until mid-February of the 2002-03 season that Porto were beaten in the league, in fact, tripped up by a trip to Maritimo. Three months later Pacos Ferreira enjoyed a 1-0 win over Porto, but no one could take three points from Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o \u2013 only Belenenses took even one, on the first day of the season. Porto finished champions ahead of Benfica, 11 points clear at the top and not put off their stride by a successful Uefa Cup campaign. New signings worked \u2013 Derlei was the Uefa Cup&apos;s top scorer, and the old worked in ways anew; after the final, a fraught win over Celtic, Kevin McCarra wrote in the Guardian: &quot;Deco has turned into a a creator of the highest calibre.&quot; The following season Porto were just as successful in the league, losing only twice \u2013 both as the season wore on and both ahead of Champions League second legs. Their home remained a fortress, save for a group-stage defeat to Real Madrid. In the knockout stages of the Champions League, Manchester United, Lyon and Deportivo fell before the final against Monaco, another side on an upward trajectory that would soon lose J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen, Ludovic Giuly and loanees Hugo Ibarra, \u00c9douard Ciss\u00e9, and Fernando Morientes. &quot;Mourinho, an artist of strategy, destroyed Didier Deschamps&apos;s team with his canny adjustments,&quot; read the Guardian&apos;s report, reflecting on the switch of Dmitri Alenitchev in place of Carlos Alberto. &quot;It was a subtle and lethal switch to counterattacking means.&quot; Porto won virtually everything they could have done in two-and-a-half-seasons under Mourinho; wondering what might have been probably seems a smidge perverse. What do you mean, what might have been? They won everything! Two league titles, the Portuguese Cup, the Portuguese SuperCup, the Uefa Cup and the Champions League. And they have kept on winning the league in Mourinho&apos;s wake, as well as domestic cups aplenty. But we&apos;re perhaps entitled to wonder what sort of European dominance Porto might have mustered had Mourinho not been out the door the second the 2003-04 Champions League title was won (Carvalho and Ferreira following him to Chelsea and Deco heading for Barcelona); he has, after all, taken his club to a semi-final or better in six of the nine seasons since. GT 6) Bayer Leverkusen If you were to ask the BBC sound department for an accompaniment to the end of Leverkusen&apos;s 2001-02 season, they would probably dig out a heavily worn tape from Some Mothers Do &apos;Ave &apos;Em. Something with enough crash-bang-screeching-cat to convey the calamity of the late-season defeats that allowed Borussia Dortmund to nab top spot in the Bundesliga; the defeat to Schalke in the German Cup final; the more predictable (Ze Roberto was suspended and Jens Nowotny was injured) but no less painful loss to Real Madrid in the Champions League final. The collapse of Leverkusen&apos;s aspirations tends to define the story but this was a superb side: Michael Ballack and Yildiray Basturk operating in perfect tandem in central midfield while Ze Roberto and Bernd Schneider probed out wide. Oliver Neuville was just about as clever a lone striker as you could find. Klaus Toppm\u00f6ller gave his backline flexibility in numbers by playing Carsten Ramelow just in front of central defence, dropping in whenever those behind him fancied a foray forward. &quot;We only have a small squad, but whoever comes in is infected by the euphoria which surrounds us,&quot; Ballack told reporters ahead of the Champions League final, but the feelgood factor took a hit when the end of the season arrived with no silverware. Ballack left for Bayern Munich, as did Ze Roberto, instantly robbing the side of impetus \u2013 Ballack was the club&apos;s top scorer with 17 league goals in 2001-02. The team only just avoided relegation the following season, midway through which Toppm\u00f6ller was sacked, and other members of the Champions League final team gradually drifted away: Boris Zivkovic and Thomas Brdaric in 2003, and Basturk and Neuville in 2004.

However Viagogo, whose UK operation is Chelsea&apos;s official ticket partner, already has 11 pages of available tickets being sold by third parties, with prices as high as $3,712.70, plus a 15% booking fee and postage, despite a face value of \u20ac45-135. Those prices have caused dismay among Chelsea supporters already riled by the relatively small number of official tickets made available for the final and also facing rapidly soaring transport and accommodation prices. The London club received 17,500 tickets for the Champions League final last season at the 71,000-seat Allianz Arena, and this year&apos;s finalists, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, will receive 25,000 each for the Wembley game this month. &quot;The allocation is clearly inadequate and I would appeal to Uefa to think about changing this in future,&quot; said Tim Rolls from the Chelsea Supporters Trust. &quot;Effectively it would mean less than half of the club&apos;s season-ticket holders having the opportunity to attend, and for 40% of those in the stadium to be fans of the two clubs seems ridiculous. It is shocking. &quot;Viagogo and the people who shamelessly sell tickets on their site, whether they are sponsors or corporate clients, are making major money out of this so it&apos;s another example of football being taken away from the everyday fan. &quot;The prices for some of those tickets on Viagogo at present are obscene, even if it doesn&apos;t mean they will end up being sold at that price. It will also affect the atmosphere on the night because even if Chelsea or Benfica fans do buy up some of the &apos;Uefa family&apos; tickets, they&apos;ll be dotted around the stadium.&quot; Tickets are also for sale on eBay from \u00a3400 apiece. Chelsea are believed to be unhappy about the situation but feel that there is not much they can do about it at this late stage. Uefa has promised a review for next year but warns that the problem is likely to be even worse as the final will take place at the 41,000-capacity Juventus Stadium in Turin. The European game&apos;s ruling body argues that if it earmarked a larger stadium for the final it may not end up filling it if two smaller clubs were involved and insists there is no practical way to ensure that all the various &quot;stakeholders&quot; are completely satisfied. Following an outcry from fans before the 2011 Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona at Wembley, Uefa was forced to cut the price of the cheapest tickets from \u00a3150 to \u00a360 and increase the numbers available. . But fans of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund will still pay between \u00a360 and \u00a3330 for a ticket to this year&apos;s final, again being held at Wembley. In total 59,000 tickets went on sale to the general public, with 25,000 made available for fans of each of the two finalists and 9,000 to neutrals worldwide. The remaining 27,000 tickets have been allocated to the local organising committee, national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters, and to serve the corporate hospitality programme.", "sentences": ["Tickets for the Europa League final in Amsterdam are already being sold for more than $3,700 (\u00a32,400) on the online ticket marketplace Viagogo, leaving Chelsea supporters further incensed as they struggle to come to terms with Uefa&apos;s official allocation for the game against Benfica.", "The two clubs have received only 9,800 tickets each for the match at what will be a reduced-capacity 48,000-seat Amsterdam ArenA on 15 May \u2013 amounting to only 40% of the gate \u2013 with the remainder granted to sponsors, official partners and the Uefa &quot;football family&quot;."], "title": "Chelsea fans left furious over \u00a32,400 tickets for Europa League final", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/03/chelsea-tickets-europa-league-final", "tags": ["Europa League", "Chelsea", "Football", "Benfica", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-03T14:32:39Z", "article": "LONDON CALLING On the subject of hot managerial chat, it&apos;s been Chelsea this, Chelsea that, and Chelsea the other for the best part of the week. Most of this has been, needless to say, down to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who is chipping off from the Bernab\u00e9u before Real Madrid send him skittering down La Castellana on the business portion of his pantaloons, because he&apos;s not actually done particularly well there when you factor in all the noise he&apos;s made, has he? Mourinho now wants to manage where the people still love him, which everyone has assumed is Chelsea, though the Fiver is hoping he&apos;s about to send a curveball whistling past everyone&apos;s lugs and pop up again at Uniao de Leiria. But some of that hot chat has been down to Rafa Ben\u00edtez, too, who is suddenly one game away from becoming only the third manager, behind Giovanni O&apos;Trapattoni and Udo Lattek, to win a European trophy at three different clubs. Should Chelsea prevail at the upcoming Big Vase final against Benfica, they&apos;ll become the one and only English club to have lifted all three major European titles, though Rafa in fairness will just be thinking about the embellishments on his own CV, his reputation restored to the extent that he might still be in with a shout of a top European gig at clubs such as PSG, Real Madrid and possibly even Chelsea if Mourinho takes the Uniao de Leiria job like we reckon. So with all this going on, it&apos;s rather nice that the week is ending with a snippet of managerial news emanating from elsewhere. Up north, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has announced that he would quite like to stay at Arsenal for the foreseeable future \u2013 and despite famously suffering from severe myopia, it appears he&apos;s peering all the way past the end of his contract next year. &quot;I want to stay if I do well and if I consider or the club considers that I do well,&quot; he said this morning, before chucking a further egg into the pudding with a thinly disguised transfer pledge. &quot;We have gone through a period that was very sensitive, we are coming out of it now, in a much stronger position financially. I believe the club is in a very strong position for the future.&quot; This is bad news for younger Arsenal fans who have only been sentient since the advent of Twitter, for none of them will have seen Wenger lead the club to a trophy in their self-absorbed lives, and have been carping accordingly. But older and wiser Gooners will recall Wenger&apos;s many earlier triumphs \u2013 three league titles and four FA Cups \u2013 as well as the time he invented water and broccoli and introduced them to the squad in 1996, giving several players the bends. So most folk will be pleased to hear the 63-year-old&apos;s announcement. Certainly the Fiver, for one, hopes Wenger stays on for many more seasons \u2013 if only so we can witness the inevitable hilarious touchline brouhaha with his bitter rival Mourinho, Arsenal having drawn big-spending Uniao de Leiria in 2016-17 Big Cup, naturally.

And the world&apos;s. A lot has changed in that museum during a rebuilding that kept it closed for 10 years, but one thing has remained constant. At the heart of its grandest gallery hangs, just as it ever did, Rembrandt van Rijn&apos;s masterpiece The Night Watch. Better lit than ever before, commanding a beautiful expansive hall, this national treasure holds the stage before a swarming, admiring crowd for whom \u2013 in a Dutch spring that has drawn eyes to the commonsense scale and attitudes of this polity where a monarch rationally retires to make way for the future \u2013 The Night Watch is plainly a symbol of Dutch nationhood. A patchwork parliament of varied individuals congregate in Rembrandt&apos;s democratic painting. The Night Watch was painted in the 17th century as a group portrait of a militia company led by one Frans Banning Cocq. Companies of urban militia were part of the everyday life of the Dutch Republic, as it asserted its independence from the Spanish empire. Yet Rembrandt&apos;s masterpiece is nothing like a conventional patriotic painting. It simultaneously transcends and mocks its context. Instead of a distinguished company of worthy officers and well-trained men Rembrandt shows a baroque profusion of gestures and expressions, a raggle taggle crowd of comic types from an old soldier hunched over his gun to the preening figures of the militia captain and his lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch. He also adds enigmatic details \u2013 why is there a little girl among the soldiers and why does light fall on her in such a moving golden glow? No two faces point the same way: everyone is looking somewhere else and every figure is differently aligned. Instead of discipline, Rembrandt suggests something close to chaos. In British terms it is more Dad&apos;s Army than Lady Thatcher&apos;s funeral. So why is The Night Watch so stirring? Why is it considered a national symbol when it seems to mock the Dutch as part-time soldiers and foolish burghers? The comedy of this immense pairing is counterposed with tragedy. It is, truly, a watch through the night. The human, all too human company stand together against encroaching shadows. A soft, enfolding fog of night surrounds them. The light that illuminates them is a flash in the dark. They are all the more heroic for being so vulnerable, flawed and eccentric. Most of all, they stand together, as a human community. Rembrandt&apos;s masterpiece in modern times has come to epitomise Dutch national pride, and the reopening of the Rijksmuseum in which it holds court was a national event on a par with the coronation. Yet it also has a universal political significance. No other great painting so powerfully depicts democracy. In classical Athens, the sculpted Parthenon frieze represented Athenian democracy to itself in an image of a communal procession. The Night Watch too epitomises an entire community. But in a daringly modern move it makes that community look vulnerable. In the 21st century, as democracy and community are beset by menaces from climate change to the violent economics of austerity, The Night Watch ought to be cherished as political art. It portrays not only what the Dutch, but all democracies ought to hold dear \u2013 the courage of flawed human beings to come together while acknowledging one another&apos;s individuality and difference. It is an icon of tolerance, diversity and the magic golden light that makes a society work. While these ordinary people stand guard, we feel a bit safer in our collective defiance of the dark.", "sentences": ["On a sunny morning in Amsterdam with banners welcoming a new monarch still decorating the streets, thousands of Dutch people crowded the other day into the recently reopened Rijksmuseum to enjoy their artistic heritage."], "title": "Time to revisit Rembrandt's The Night Watch, a glowing symbol of democracy | Jonathan Jones", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/06/rembrandt-the-night-watch-netherlands-rijksmuseum", "tags": ["Art", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news", "Art and design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-06T18:00:00Z", "article": "Winner of Amnesty International&apos;s Young human rights reporter of the year competition sixth-form category: Holly Gomez, 17, Woodfarm High, East Renfrewshire, Scotland Scars not only physical for North Korea&apos;s &apos;ghost prisoners&apos; Witnessing a six-year-old beaten to death for eating corn, being hung upside down on a coal fire and having a knuckle chopped off for dropping a sewing machine. Is this the reality for prisoners of North Korea&apos;s modern day concentration camps? Yes. However, &quot;No&quot; is the answer from the North Korean authorities who consistently deny their very existence. The ghost prisoner Shin Dong-hyuk, along with 200,000 others, go through these traumatic ordeals on a daily basis. People in Kwanliso are considered &quot;sub-human animals&quot; that are not worthy of being taught anything. For 23 years Shin Dong thought that &quot;society inside the camp would be the same as outside&quot;. Shin believed that he was born to be a prisoner, even though the reality was that he was an innocent victim of a tragic system, known as the &quot;three generations of punishment&quot;. When Shin&apos;s uncle committed the capital crime of escaping from the state, his remaining family was imprisoned for life in Camp 14. Shin was born and bred there. It was not until meeting an older prisoner, a disgraced party official who had travelled abroad, that he started to dream of a world beyond the electric fence - and beyond North Korea. After 23 years of constant torment, in 2005, he escaped camp 14 by climbing through the barbed wire and eventually arrived in South Korea to start a new life. This is the first time that someone has escaped from the brutal camp; however, unfortunately it is not as simple as starting afresh. When Shin Dong was interviewed, he said, &quot;I live a content life. But mentally I am very distraught.&quot; There is no escaping the graphic memories and the inhumane experiences. As Shin was unable to communicate with family members within the camp, relationships were complex and confusing for Shin. He simply does &quot;not know what love is&quot;. Due to Google Maps and human rights activists the camps have been mapped. Activists spotted another camp appear on the map in early January 2013. So what has been done? It is increasingly difficult to put an end to these camps \u2013 how can you stop that which officially does not exist? The only evidence we have has been voiced by Shin Dong, a voice which gives us an insight into unimaginably appalling treatment of innocent people. The public being able to look in with such clarity on the camps might \u2013 just might \u2013 move the needle a bit to the side of humanity. These barbaric concentration camps are not just North Korea&apos;s problem. A global change is needed in order to fit a modern, apparently &apos;more civilised&apos; society. While we sit back, cosseted in our homes, there is a world beyond our imagination of people who are being treated atrociously - yet nothing is done. They are ghosts in the eyes of the North Korean authorities; ghosts to us all. As Shin carries the mental and physical scars of his experiences, so too are the scars borne by our society. Sixth-form runner-up: Louise Wylie, 16, Knightswood Secondary, Glasgow Torture masked as tradition &quot;Harmful practices, such as genital mutilation, constitute a serious threat to the health of millions of women and girls worldwide and violate their fundamental rights&quot;. So said Ban Ki Moon, United Nations Secretary-General, addressing the issue of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). Three million girls between birth and age 15 across Africa, Asia and the Middle East are at risk of circumcision. These girls are rarely asked for their permission, and are almost never forewarned. They are simply taken aside by older women, and often an untrained woman slashes at their genitalia with rusty, sullied &apos;medical&apos; instruments, causing extreme pain and leaving them at risk of infection, shock, haemorrhage, infertility, childbirth complications, and even death. There are no medical advantages of this procedure, which can also include sewing the vagina to preserve the virginity of the girls. These stitches must be removed each time the woman gives birth, or else she risks the threat of her baby becoming brain-damaged or both her and her baby dying. Those in favour of this &apos;tradition&apos; claim it is an integral part of their culture and customs. This belief is the driving force behind women in other parts of the world, including Britain, who decide their daughters should be violated in this way. Others are convinced it is an Islamic religious requirement, and is sacred. However research has shown that FGM predates Islam, Christianity and even Judaism. This custom has simply been rebranded by a small minority as &apos;religious&apos;, when in reality Islam does not and has never supported it. Waris Dirie knows only too well the dangers of circumcision. She is a human rights activist who campaigns incessantly on behalf on women like herself: those scarred, emotionally and physically in the name of tradition. &quot;Female mutilation has no cultural, no traditional and no religious aspect,&quot; she asserts. &quot;It is a crime which seeks justice&quot;. At the age of five she, like 98% of all girls in Somalia, was mutilated. Speaking about the ordeal, she said: &quot;Mama tied a blindfold over my eyes. The next thing I felt my flesh was being cut away. I heard the blade sawing back and forth through my skin. The pain between my legs was so intense I wished I would die.&quot; Somehow, she managed to flee her country aged only 13 and is now a special UN ambassador for the elimination of FGM. Unfortunately, Waris Dirie is one of a small minority. The World Health Organisation has estimated that for every 1,000 babies delivered in six African countries, 10-20 deaths are directly due to FGM. The only way to stop this epidemic is through education. Rural communities must be made aware of the reality of circumcision. Many, many women are dying as a result of ignorance and this has to change. The suffering from Female Genital Mutilation has to end. As Dirie explained, &quot;everyone (has) to be enlightened about the status of genital mutilation: not culture, but torture.&quot; Sources; WHO, www.un.org, www.forwarduk.org.uk; www.desertflowerfoundation.org; www.npwj.org  Sixth-form runner-up: Charlie Blake, 17, Bancroft&apos;s school, Woodford Green, Essex  Poisoned for profit J\u00e9r\u00f4me Agoua gets up early as usual. He works in Abidjan, the largest city in the Ivory Coast, and has a wife and family to feed so he needs to be on time. Only this is not a usual morning. Something&apos;s wrong with the air. It&apos;s thick with an unbearable sulphurous stench and when J\u00e9r\u00f4me rubs the sleep from his eyes he flinches \u2013 they&apos;re swollen and bloodshot. His children wake up gasping but he can&apos;t explain to them what&apos;s going on. It gets worse over the coming days: nausea, fevers and diarrhoea set in, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me is forced to send his pregnant wife to a nearby town with the children. He stays, desperate to earn money for his family, but aware that he is slowly poisoning himself. Over a hundred thousand people like J\u00e9r\u00f4me were affected by the dumping of toxic waste on 20th August 2006, and at least fifteen died as a result; yet the company responsible denies any wrongdoing and continues to evade justice. The waste had arrived in the country by sea three days previously, property of the Dutch oil trader Trafigura. The substance was a by-product of a controversial caustic washing process \u2013 he cheaper of two potential methods \u2013 used to refine large amounts of gasoline. Trafigura hurriedly signed a contract with an unknown, newly licensed disposal company who, at a disconcertingly low price, offered to &quot;discharge&quot; the waste at a local site named Akou\u00e9do. A simple check would have revealed that this was an open-air dumpsite for domestic waste, not a specialist facility as was required, but Trafigura didn&apos;t want to know. The workers at Akou\u00e9do closed the sight swiftly once they realised something was wrong with the incoming waste, so the rest was dumped around Abidjan during the night. UN legislation recognises the right to protection from &quot;exposure to harmful substances such as radiation and harmful chemicals&quot; (ICESCR), but Trafigura clearly didn&apos;t see this as their corporate responsibility. Perhaps this attitude stemmed from their obsession with profits \u2013 Trafigura had already rejected one opportunity to dispose of the waste safely following a pricing dispute in Amsterdam and emails reveal that they only purchased the gasoline initially because it was &quot;as cheap as anyone can imagine and should make serious dollar&quot;. They cut corners, ignored warnings and almost certainly knew that the waste wouldn&apos;t be handled safely, yet thanks to an out-of-court settlement with the Ivorian government, Trafigura can&apos;t legally be prosecuted for the dumping and have escaped admitting responsibility for their humanitarian crime. That a company can purchase immunity from accountability shocks me, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Agoua \u2013 now head of a victims&apos; association \u2013 shares this sentiment: &quot;No one from Trafigura ever approached me. I am the leader of a victims&apos; organization and no one has approached me, it is deplorable. This story pains me.&quot; Yet until states commit themselves to tightening laws on human rights due diligence, closing jurisdictional loopholes, and prosecuting companies for crimes committed abroad, it will only be a matter of time before this kind of episode repeats itself.

Victory against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday evening means Chelsea would be guaranteed to finish in the top four thanks to their superior goal difference. Spurs and Arsenal would then be left to fight it out for the remaining place. Mata, whose 87th-minute deflected goal secured a crucial victory over Manchester United on Sunday to keep his side in third, said: &quot;It was a tough game physically and mentally. We knew that it was like a final for us. We have two finals in a row: [at United] and on Wednesday against Tottenham. And I think if we win the two games we will be much closer than last week [to qualification]. &quot;Tottenham is a team [who are] winning and winning: making pressure on us and Arsenal. So we are three teams fighting for two positions \u2013 and now we are third again. We play at home and I think if we win on Wednesday we will be almost for sure in the Champions League.&quot; After facing Spurs, Chelsea&apos;s final two league games are Saturday&apos;s trip to Aston Villa and the visit of Everton on the final day. In between is the Europa League final in Amsterdam on Wednesday week. &quot;If we are able to achieve the Europa League, and if we finish third in the Premier League, it will be a great season for us: winning a trophy and playing in the Champions League next season,&quot; Mata said. Fourth place would mean a play-off spot. Tottenham will arrive at Stamford Bridge with Gareth Bale, the double player of the year, continuing his fine form, the Welshman having scored in five of his past six games including the winner at Southampton on Saturday. &quot;For me Gareth is, right now, one of the best in the world,&quot; Mata said. &quot;Not just in England, not just in Europe \u2013 in the world. He is able to decide a game, as he did [at the weekend]. He has the pace, he has the quality, he is strong, he is very young. So he is very good right now, and he has a bright future for sure.&quot; Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas will be making a first return to Chelsea since being sacked as manager last year. Mata believes the Portuguese should receive a warm welcome. &quot;I think a nice one, because he tried the best he could for the club, and for me personally he was the man who I came with. So he gave me confidence, and I think he is a very great person as well,&quot; he said. &quot;When I first came he gave me confidence, he helped me to settle down and, yes, I think he is a great manager, and a good person for me.&quot; Mata believes that Rafael Ben\u00edtez, who is unpopular with sections of Chelsea&apos;s support, has proved that he is a good coach. &quot;Well I think he is.

Choosing your dream home has become as simple as picking furniture from the Ikea catalogue for residents of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, where a neighbourhood of affordable architect-designed kit houses has just been launched. Aimed at first-time buyers, the city&apos;s &quot;I build affordable in Nijmegen&quot; initiative (IbbN) has paired 20 architects with building companies to produce about 30 designs \u2013 from detached timber cabins to redbrick terraced houses \u2013 with a construction cost of as little as \u20ac115,000 (\u00a397,400). Anyone with an annual income of between \u20ac30,000 and \u20ac47,000 is eligible to apply for the IbbN loan, while all costs are fixed from the beginning, removing the usual danger of ballooning budgets and long delays when building your own, untested house. Designed to be manufactured from prefabricated parts, in close collaboration with the builder, the flatpack kits are delivered to\u00a0the site and can be assembled within six to eight weeks. &quot;Since the economic crisis, both architects and the city are trying to find\u00a0new ways to build houses,&quot; said Elsbeth Ronner of LRVH architects, a young practice that has designed one of\u00a0the house types, a straw-bale eco-house inspired by local haylofts. &quot;There are few developers willing to build, so the city is selling plots directly to the residents and letting them do it for themselves.&quot; For young architects such as Ronner, whose practice has so far only worked on refurbishment projects, the scheme also provides an opportunity to get into housebuilding. &quot;It is difficult to approach potential clients when you haven&apos;t built anything,&quot; she said. &quot;People always think working with an architect will be more expensive and take longer, but this way they feel more secure. We&apos;ve always wanted to make a really cheap, sustainable house and this gives us a great way into the market.&quot; IbbN joins a growing movement of self-build kit homes in the Netherlands, following the example set by the new town of Almere near Amsterdam, where more than 800 homes have been built in this way since 2006, with thousands more on the way. And momentum is beginning to build in the UK. In Middlesbrough&apos;s docks, on the sprawling site of the stalled Middlehaven regeneration project, an area has been set aside for self-build, with a competition launched for innovative ideas, while parts of east London&apos;s Olympic site could be given over to up to 100 self-build homes. So could flatpack kit housing be part of the answer? &quot;System-building makes it so much easier,&quot; said Ted Stevens of the National\u00a0Self Build Association. &quot;Rather than giving people an entirely blank piece of paper, it&apos;s like a big menu with options to choose from. A lot of people are put off self-build because of the uncertainty involved, but this way the price and delivery time are guaranteed \u2013 making the process much more like buying a car.&quot; It is also much cheaper: by cutting out the developer&apos;s profit, the average self-built house in the UK costs just 60% of its final value to build. If more local authority land can be opened up, and architects retained at the centre of the process, it seems to make more sense than ever to go Dutch.", "sentences": ["We&apos;ve always wanted to make a really cheap, sustainable house and this gives us a great way into the market.&quot; IbbN joins a growing movement of self-build kit homes in the Netherlands, following the example set by the new town of Almere near Amsterdam, where more than 800 homes have been built in this way since 2006, with thousands more on the way."], "title": "Flatpack homes offer Dutch first-time buyers chance to get on housing ladder", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/may/07/flatpack-houses-nijmegen-netherlands", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news", "Housing", "First-time buyers", "Property", "Money"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-07T16:58:11Z", "article": "David Cameron has been forced to defend his plans to renegotiate the terms of Britain&apos;s EU membership after the former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson said Britain should leave because the prime minister will only secure &quot;piffling changes&quot;. As Conservative MPs hailed Lawson for creating a &quot;game-changing&quot; moment, the prime minister rejected Lawson&apos;s intervention and insisted he would be able to secure real changes in Britain&apos;s membership terms. &quot;I want to give people a choice not between the status quo and leaving the European Union,&quot; the prime minister said at a conference on Somalia in London. &quot;I want to give people a proper choice between Britain remaining in a reformed EU or leaving that EU. That&apos;s the choice that people will have. That is the choice that people want. And there is only one way to get it and that will be by supporting the Conservatives at the next election. Frankly, I welcome the attention that is being put on this very clear promise.&quot; But Bernard Jenkin, the former shadow defence secretary, sided with Lawson as he declared it was &quot;moonshine&quot; for Downing Street to assume Cameron could reform the EU. The prime minister spoke out after Lawson became the most senior figure in the party to call for Britain to leave the EU. He said that senior EU officials had warned him the prime minister would achieve negligible results in a renegotiation of Britain&apos;s membership terms. Tories responded to Lawson&apos;s remarks by saying he had afforded respectability to Ukip. They also said that the former chancellor had given cover to anti-EU Tory MPs who have been nervous about speaking out. One MP said: &quot;The Lawson intervention is transformational, it is potentially a game changing moment. Ukip can say to us: &apos;You said we were fruitcakes and now Margaret Thatcher&apos;s longest-serving chancellor says we are right.&apos; &quot;Conservatives who want to leave the EU, but who have been nervous about saying so, will now feel less worried about saying that.&quot; Lawson, who has felt for some time in private that Britain should leave the EU, said British financial services and banking are being subjected to &quot;extremely damaging&quot; EU regulations. He also warned that the political integration among members of the single currency makes no sense for Britain. The former chancellor added that the prime minister, who has pledged to hold a referendum by 2017 after renegotiating Britain&apos;s membership terms, would probably only win &quot;piffling changes \u2026 of no consequence whatever&quot;. He told The World at One: &quot;I have a lot of friends within what I call the &apos;eurocracy&apos; and they all assure me that he will not be given any significant changes at all. It is the nature of the EU that there is only way of travel; which is to more and more pass to the centre.&quot; Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, rejected Lawson&apos;s call for Britain to withdraw from the EU, saying that leaving it would make Britain &quot;less safe&quot; and would jeopardise up to 3m jobs linked to the single market. But Lawson gave his remarks short shrift. &quot;Of course that is poppycock.

The\u00a0setting is the world fair at Ghent. Visitors from every nation in the world throng the stands, marvelling at the ingenuity of modern man. Business cards get swapped, order books filled. The mood is open and curious, with conversations shifting easily between languages. The talk might be about British ball bearings, Flemish lace or Portuguese wine. Later, over a coffee or\u00a0beer, someone may mention the recent royal wedding attended by a full\u00a0sweep of royal cousins: George of Britain, Nicholas of Russia and Wilhelm of Germany. Here is cosmopolitanism showing its sunniest face to the world: mild, pragmatic and touchingly convinced that it is doing its best by\u00a0everyone. This is just the sort of opening scene we are used to in narratives that begin in 1913 \u2013 a more sophisticated version of the summer garden party in which girls in white frocks play croquet on a vicarage lawn. We know that in the very next beat the sky will darken, the music will go atonal, and the bright colours will drain to sepia as the guns move in. But Emmerson does not give us that next beat. For it is not his intention to describe how or why the Great War began. Instead, he wants us to continue to potter among the stalls at Ghent, experiencing what it felt like to be alive in 1913, unaware of the coming rip in history. To further decentre the war from his\u00a0narrative, he takes us on a tour that includes places apparently aloof from the approaching carnage. What, for instance, was it like to be a beef baron in Buenos Aires, a wine merchant in Algiers or a tyre manufacturer in Tokyo? Actually, it turns out, it wasn&apos;t all that different from being a clerk in London or a banker in Berlin. In the newly joined-up world of 1913, information, artefacts and people hurtled around the world at dizzying speeds. The report of a poor wheat harvest in Canada meant a fall on the stock market in London the next day. Model T Fords struck out from Detroit to do sterling service in the coffee plantations of Brazil and the sheep farms of New Zealand. Russia, far from\u00a0stewing in its own juices, was publishing books in 49 languages. Emmerson is able to make his case about globalisation by arguing that 1913 was the year the world finally turned urban. From China to Brazil, men and women were pouring into the\u00a0expanding towns to remake their lives. Citizens, fresh from the country, encounter new jobs, new drinks, new dances, even new kinds of bodies. In Peking, dawdling citizens are even told to stand up straight and walk faster if they really want to get on. Not everyone enjoyed being modern. Naysayers grumbled that the world now turned so fast that it would soon spin off its axis. In Pera, a suburb of Constantinople, you could buy &quot;Parisian&quot; scarves made in Manchester, Nestl\u00e9&apos;s condensed milk from Switzerland and Russian galoshes. Tokyo&apos;s new railway station was modelled on Amsterdam Centraal while Bombay&apos;s Victoria station showed a puzzling resemblance to London&apos;s St Pancras. Shanghai&apos;s Customs House, meanwhile, was built in a style best described as Tudorbethan. While electricity now lit up the main streets in Tehran and Algiers, it only served to make the side streets seem darker than before, and 1913 turned into a year of frightening shadows. In Vienna a Jewish clerk was arrested on a\u00a0trumped-up charge of ritual murder. In Russia, whispering the word &quot;constitution&quot; on the freezing air was still enough to bring a policeman to your door. In other parts of the world, protesters marched and waved placards. A British-trained lawyer called Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi rallied Indian miners in Natal against laws designed to squeeze them into ghettoes. Such was the speed with which news travelled that Indians on the subcontinent were soon joining in to protest this attack on their cherished right to move freely around the British Empire. In Palestine, things quickly turned nasty. Fanned by newspapers, sectarian tensions increased to the point where a banal incident involving the theft of some grapes was enough to trigger a murderous street brawl between Arabs and Jews. Particularly striking are the literary sources Emmerson uses to recreate the world of 100 years ago (and remember it&apos;s all recent: there are 13,000 people in the UK today who were alive in 1913). Rather than high literature, he mostly opts for demotic texts, journalism and hack novels, to get a feel for the splits and bumps that marked private and public thinking. So\u00a0instead of Proust, DH Lawrence and\u00a0Freud, we have the intelligent but non-canonical work of Stefan Zweig and Israel Zangwill. A chapter on Mexico City makes great use of a potboiler called Philip Dru, written by\u00a0Woodrow Wilson&apos;s Texan adviser Edward M House, in which Mexico is incorporated into the US, a move that seemed entirely likely at the time. To understand how the inhabitants of Detroit felt about their homes, Emmerson uses a Sears catalogue, while Los Angeles&apos;s fantasies about its\u00a0own past are mapped on to a Mary\u00a0Pickford movie. Throughout this ambitious, subtle account, Emmerson tries hard not to play the hindsight game. Still, he&apos;s honest enough to acknowledge the cheap pleasure that comes from knowing what happens next. For who would not be tickled to learn that in 1913 Kaiser Wilhelm was being hailed as a glorious peacemaker, with 25 conflict-free years under his considerable belt?\u00a0Or that until recently a young Mussolini had been running a socialist group in Trieste while Trotsky was busy as a journalist in the tinkling tea shops of Vienna? Then there are those startling contemporary resonances, such as the moment when Elizabeth Kendall, a global fl\u00e2neur, declares: &quot;China is waking up, the self-satisfied complacency of the white race has received a shock&quot;. Not all the prophecies made in 1913\u00a0turn out to be quite as spot-on as Kendall&apos;s, though. India, according to a\u00a0piece in the Evening Standard, would probably never wish to be independent of Britain. The Channel Tunnel was confidently declared to be only a few years away. Oddest of all, however, was the suggestion that, by the year 2013, the capital city of the British empire would have been obliged to relocate to\u00a0somewhere along the Canadian-US border. Such wild mis-hits are worth cherishing as a reminder that the future is never simply the present dressed up in a funny haircut. A hundred years from now we \u2013 or at least the very youngest among us \u2013 will be doing and\u00a0thinking things that are quite unguessable now. And, actually, the idea of that is really rather cheering. \u2022 Kathryn Hughes is writing a book about famous Victorians&apos; body parts.

Tom Mockridge, who spent 22 years working for Murdoch, most recently as News International&apos;s chief executive, is to join Virgin Media in June. He succeeds Neil Berkett, who will leave once Malone&apos;s Liberty Global completes its \u00a315bn takeover of Virgin Media. The combined company will be the world&apos;s largest cable group, with operations in 14 European countries and 25 million customers. Mockridge dismissed suggestions his arrival would mean a return to the open warfare between Virgin Media and Sky that preceded Berkett&apos;s promotion to the top job at Virgin in 2008. &quot;John Malone and Rupert Murdoch are clearly two very successful guys who have built businesses of true scale from nothing and they respect each other,&quot; said Mockridge. &quot;They don&apos;t wake up in the morning and see each other as somebody they need to throttle, and in the operating businesses we see things the same way.&quot; Malone once referred to BSkyB as the Death Star, and he and Murdoch have clashed a number of times, most notably a decade ago when they wrestled for control of America&apos;s biggest satellite broadcaster DirecTV. Mockridge was a trusted Murdoch lieutenant who initially ran News Corp&apos;s Australian papers and eventually led Sky Italia before being parachuted into London to take charge of the UK newspapers when Rebekah Brooks was swept overboard at the height of the phone hacking scandal. He left News International in December, after losing out to Wall Street Journal managing editor Robert Thomson for the top job in the separately listed book and newspaper publishing business that will be spun off from News Corporation&apos;s film and TV assets later this year. Mockridge&apos;s knowledge of BSkyB is detailed \u2013 he was a non-executive director of the satellite company from February 2009 and served as its deputy chairman between April 2012 and January 2013. Virgin Media is the biggest UK reseller of Sky&apos;s channels, and Mockridge said he intended to maintain a good relationship with Jeremy Darroch, Sky&apos;s chief executive. &quot;Of course there are consumer benefits in competition but Jeremy Darroch is a very skilled leader of Sky and he&apos;s a personal friend of mine, so there won&apos;t be any negative personality dynamics, quite the opposite.&quot; BT is funding the latest challenge to Sky&apos;s sports broadcasting dominance after winning the rights to a slew Premiership matches that will be the central attraction of a group of sports channels to be unveiled by the telecoms group on Thursday. Asked whether Virgin Media would bid for the Premiership at the next rights auction, Mockridge said: &quot;The short answer is no. There&apos;s plenty of other people prepared to bid good money for football. Our strategy has been invest in content opportunistically but not bet the ranch on it.&quot; However, he left the door open to expanding the footprint of Virgin&apos;s cable network, which currently reaches half of the UK population, with the rest served mainly by BT&apos;s network. &quot;There might be other ways of expanding the reach of Virgin Media, it&apos;s too soon to say. It is something we will look at more closely but we are not proclaiming any strategic areas here today.&quot; Liberty Global&apos;s chief executive, Mike Fries, said combining Virgin Media with Liberty&apos;s European companies would bring economies of scale. Together, they will purchase $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) a year of equipment, software and services and $2bn of content. Virgin Media will retain its brand and the merged company will have its headquarters in the UK, Amsterdam and Denver.

He first came to prominence in 1983 with Babi Yar, for large orchestra in three groups, championed by the Society for the Promotion of New Music (SPNM) and premiered separately on the same day by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Nicholas Cleobury, and the St Louis Symphony Orchestra under Leonard Slatkin. It was later recorded to critical acclaim. After that, though, he avoided the orchestra, preferring, from American Invention and Re-Mix (1985) onwards, to compose for smaller ensembles, not usually exceeding 13 players, such as those scored for his Steve Martland Band (formed 1992), which toured internationally like a rock group; string quartets, as with his Patrol (1992) or arrangement of Bach&apos;s Toccata and Fugue in D minor from the same year; and Wolf-Gang (1991), six operatic arias by Mozart reimagined for wind band. He produced a series of successful choral works, including Street Songs (1997) for the King&apos;s Singers and percussionist Evelyn Glennie, carols and unaccompanied works such as Skywalk (1989), Three Carols (1997) and Tyger Tyger for Youth Music&apos;s &quot;Sing Up&quot; campaign. Martland was born in Liverpool. He studied at Liverpool University (1978-81) and then attended the Royal Conservatory in the Hague on a Mendelssohn scholarship. There he was taught by Louis Andriessen, about whom he later wrote and directed a television film, A Temporary Arrangement With the Sea (1992). He also studied composition at the Berkshire Music Centre, in Massachusetts, with Gunther Schuller. Martland pursued a highly individual, at times iconoclastic career as composer, performer and teacher. His pupils held him in the highest regard despite his demands of them, mainly due to his warm-heartedness and humour. He was involved in a large number of musical and composition projects in schools in the UK and elsewhere as well as the annual &quot;Strike out&quot; course for children. Martland was an outspoken critic of academic dogma, believing diversity of musical influence was of far greater benefit, as his own compositions eloquently demonstrated. His style was rooted ultimately in an Andriessenesque combination of the minimalist style \u2013 advocated from the late 1960s in the works of Terry Riley, Steve Reich and John Adams \u2013 with more popular elements. The chugging, repeating syncopated ostinatos and rhythms played by instruments more common in jazz, pop and rock \u2013 saxophones, electric guitar and bass, drum kits with high-hat cymbals \u2013 gave his music a distinctive, edgy timbre, as in Beat the Retreat and Horses of Instruction (1995), but it was recognisable even when purely acoustic ensembles were deployed, as in Principia for winds and percussion (1989), later used as the theme music to the BBC&apos;s The Music Machine, or Crossing the Border for strings (1990). The muscular cast of his music proved continually attractive to choreographers, as with Crossing the Border, produced as a ballet by the National Ballet in Amsterdam, and Dance Works (1993), written for the London Contemporary Dance Company, the music existing in two versions, for ensemble and two amplified pianos. Martland&apos;s music was also used in film and TV, including Albion (1988) \u2013 a multimedia work that gave voice to his left-of-centre political views, including an attack on Thatcherism and the poverty of its cultural legacy \u2013 and scores for the 1992 children&apos;s series Wilderness Edge, for Granada. In the later 1990s, Martland&apos;s production slowed to a set of arrangements of Purcell. From 2000 to 2002 he concentrated on his role as artistic director of the SPNM, and resumed significant composition only in 2003 with a series of works for string ensembles: Plaint (2003), Tiger Dancing (2005, commissioned for the Henri Oguike Dance Company), Eternity&apos;s Sunrise, Reveille (both 2007) and the test piece for string quartet and percussion, Starry Night, for the Tromp International music festival in 2008. He served as composer-in-residence for the Etna music festival (2006-07) and in 2009 he returned to choral music composition with the cantata Darwin and Sea Songs (2011), written for the conductor and baritone Paul Hillier and premiered by Ars Nova in Denmark last year. \u2022 Steve Martland, composer, born 10 October 1954; died 6 May 2013 \u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2014 to correct the birthdate and age of Steve Martland.

The London club&apos;s interim first-team manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, will only formalise his selection for the game at the Amsterdam ArenA after Saturday&apos;s trip to Aston Villa, where victory will effectively secure Chelsea a top-four finish and, therefore, meet the Spaniard&apos;s principal objective. Yet Ben\u00edtez has confirmed Lampard will start that game at Villa Park, suggesting a team-mate is being rested with the Benfica match in mind, while stressing competition for places at centre-half is currently fierce at the club. That will have serious implications for Terry, who had started successive games against Basel and Swansea for the first time since February but has now sat out the last three matches. The captain may well start against Villa though that, too, could affect his involvement next midweek. &quot;The competition in this position is really hard here,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez. &quot;[Gary] Cahill, [Branislav] Ivanovic, David Luiz are all doing well, too. Now we have four centre-backs who have to compete, and they are doing well.&quot; Both Lampard and Terry were recently omitted from the starting lineup for the FA Cup semi-final defeat to Manchester City, an indication of their recent slip in standing. Asked specifically whether Terry would start against the Portuguese given the anguish he had endured missing last year&apos;s final, following his dismissal for kicking Barcelona&apos;s Alexis S\u00e1nchez in the semi-final, Ben\u00edtez said: &quot;I haven&apos;t decided yet [on Terry]. What I can say is that Lampard will play against Aston Villa. I cannot say anything about the final. We have to play another game and, after, we will decide the team for the final. That&apos;s it. The only player I can guarantee will be picked is Lampard against Villa. After, we will see about the final.&quot; Lampard is perched one shy of Bobby Tambling&apos;s club record of 202 goals and, while he is expected to be offered a new 12-month deal at Stamford Bridge, no offer has as yet been put to a player whose current contract expires at the end of June. Ben\u00edtez was asked whether he might consider starting the 34-year-old midfielder in the final as a gesture for his service to the club over the years, and offer him the chance to overhaul Tambling&apos;s achievement. &quot;If he can score against Aston Villa, it will be easier for me in the last two games,&quot; he said. &quot;Frank is a great professional, a very good player. His fitness is quite good, he&apos;s working hard. I will do what I have to do to win games. If, at the same time, I can help Frank, I will do it.&quot; The England midfielder&apos;s future will only be determined at the end of the campaign, with the prospect of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho returning to the club likely to enhance the veteran&apos;s chances of being offered new terms. &quot;I think it would be a great thing for the club,&quot; said Lampard. &quot;He is a successful manager and would be great for any club. He is certainly one of the greatest managers, if not the greatest, in world football. Those sentiments were echoed by Mikel John Obi, who was signed by Mourinho during his first spell at the club and who has worked under seven different managers in the years since. &quot;And now another one is coming in \u2026 the club is crazy, but we have to keep doing our job,&quot; said the midfielder. &quot;We&apos;re the players. The board and the owner make the decision as to whoever comes in. Mourinho did buy me. He is a fantastic guy, a great guy, and a fantastic human being on and off the pitch. He is someone who listens to the players, lifts them, knows when to put his arm around them. &quot;Everywhere he goes players tend to work for him and fight for him. If he&apos;s the next one coming in, he&apos;s someone I know, who a few of the players know. From the first day he tells you what he wants from you.

Piles of old\u00a0snow lie gathered on the streets, and walls of multi-coloured graffiti sing out against the still-wintery skies. At the Michelberger hotel, preparations are underway for tonight&apos;s concert: the National are set to play through songs from their new album, Trouble Will Find Me, before an audience of assembled journalists and exhilarated fans. In the courtyard, a stage is being assembled and outdoor heaters fired up. There are blown-up prints of the album artwork on the walls, and a selection of themed cocktails, their names inspired by both the band and\u00a0the new songs, are on the menu.\u00a0The\u00a0Dessner, I am told, is particularly lethal. A little after nine o&apos;clock the crowd has gathered, cold-faced and giddy, before the stage, and the night seems charged with all the thrill of a Christmas carol concert. When the band take to the stage soon afterwards \u2013 singer Matt Berninger clutching a bottle of wine and propping a lyrics sheet up on a lectern beside him \u2013 there is much clapping and whooping and fizzling. It seems not so much eager anticipation as a feverish delight that greets these songs tonight. They run through new tracks \u2013 Graceless, Don&apos;t Swallow the Cap, I Should Live in Salt \u2013 and weave in a couple of old favourites (Fake Empire and Bloodbuzz Ohio) for good\u00a0measure. As he sings, Berninger&apos;s breath wreathes white in the cold night\u00a0air. The National are that rare type of band, regarded with reverence by audiences and critics alike. Though some might dismiss their work as miserablist dirge, an Eeyored monologue backed by guitars, this would be to overlook the National&apos;s keen sense of lyrical humour, their delight in language and musical experimentation. What they have perfected, over the course of six albums, is a kind of glistening melancholy, a strangely beautiful dourness. The band have accumulated success since 2001 with their self-titled debut, but it was their last record, 2010&apos;s High Violet, that propelled them to a new level of acclaim \u2013 riding high on the critics&apos; end-of-year lists and earning them a Brit award nomination for best international breakthrough act (on the\u00a0night, they sadly lost out to Justin Bieber). Made up of Berninger and two sets of siblings \u2013 the Dessners (Aaron and Bryce, who are twins) and the Devendorfs (Bryan and Scott, who are not) \u2013 the band took shape in Brooklyn in the late 90s. All hail from Cincinnati, Ohio, however \u2013 the Dessners and the Devendorfs were childhood friends who played on the same high-school sports teams, while Berninger met Scott Devendorf at the University of\u00a0Cincinnati. They do not, it has to be said, make the most obvious of rock stars. At 42 and bespectacled, Berninger has the look of a hip college professor rather than a wild-living musician. But it is also a result of the band&apos;s unabashed intellect. Berninger, a graphic design graduate, is married to Carin Besser, one-time fiction editor of the New Yorker and sometime contributor to the National&apos;s lyrics. Meanwhile the Dessners \u2013 Bryce, with a masters in classical guitar from Yale, and his brother, with a modern European history and cultural anthropology degree from Columbia \u2013 can sometimes seem like the conservators of the modern alternative rock scene. Between them they have collaborated with such diverse musical talents as the Amsterdam Sinfonietta, Philip Glass, Jonny Greenwood and the visual artist Matthew Ritchie. They have written songs about planets, Abraham Lincoln and the Mayan creation story Popol Vuh. They have been invited to perform at contemporary music festivals across Europe, been commissioned by the Kronos Quartet, scored movie soundtracks, curated 2009&apos;s Red Hot compilation Dark Was the Night, founded a record label and a music festival and, more recently, oversaw a three-day festival in New York named Crossing Brooklyn Ferry. Such is the draw of the National that their albums often boast the input of many of their contemporaries \u2013 Sufjan Stevens, Sharon van Etten and Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire among them.            Reading on a mobile? View here  A few days after the Berlin show, we meet on a warm Sunday morning in London to talk about the new record. Trouble Will Find Me is without question their best album to date \u2013 the songs are looser and more limber than those of its predecessor. They have a characteristic darkness, of course \u2013 the recurrent themes of death, and the passing of time, a still-lingering preoccupation with the metaphor of water \u2013 but they seem somehow poppier now, from the\u00a0steady charge of the first single, Demons, to the late-night, bar-room waltz of Pink Rabbits, via the heartbreaking simplicity of I Need My Girl. &quot;I think part of it is that for at least half the record the original demos formed the basis of the recordings,&quot; says Aaron Dessner, his voice like thin twine. &quot;And they have a spontaneous quality to them, because with some of them they were recorded literally just right after the idea was\u00a0created.&quot; He pauses. &quot;And with this record we played together in a way that we hadn&apos;t done in a while. So I think we captured more interaction in the music. It was less constructive, more casual.&quot; It is Dessner who, with his brother, tends to spawn the National&apos;s songs. Working separately, each will weave the\u00a0beginnings of a track \u2013 a &quot;sketch&quot;, they call it \u2013 and send it on to their fellow band-members for additions, subtractions, embellishments, discussions and, ultimately, to Berninger for melody and lyrics. In Berlin, chatting to Aaron after the show, there was a levity to him \u2013 he talked readily of the pleasures and confusions of new fatherhood, of his home and his life in New York. But this morning, with his professional hat on, there is an intensity to his conversation \u2013 his thoughts specific, precise, his words carefully planted, that seems to echo the way he works. Later Bryce, his manner more leisurely than that of his twin, will tell me: &quot;I know that basically my brother goes crazy every time we make a record. So, now I know that, I just work with him and respect the process. He becomes despondent over the slightest thing \u2026 if some detail has been added [to a song] that derails anything, it becomes a massive emergency. That&apos;s kind of how my brother works.&quot; Berninger provides the counterpoint to Aaron. He is a tall, imposing presence with his own more assured breed of intensity. He is something of a raconteur, and enjoys the fact that during the recording of an album the rest of the band will remain sober while he merrily boozes. &quot;This is the first record since our first record that I had fun making,&quot; he says of Trouble Will Find Me. &quot;Because I was relaxed. I enjoyed it. It&apos;s not that I\u00a0didn&apos;t work really hard. It wasn&apos;t that it was &apos;easy&apos;; there was a lot of work. But the time I spent doing it I was happy. Even though the songs are dark \u2026 a lot of them are sad and about death, but I was finding myself totally being sucked in and finding such a soothing enjoyable process of looking for melodies and trying different things, finding different words.&quot; It was not always this way. &quot;For me, I\u00a0used to be the type of writer who would describe writing every word as bleeding drop by drop from the forehead,&quot; he explains. &quot;This time I was complete blood-letting into the thing. And that&apos;s the first time it&apos;s happened for us in 10 years.&quot;           The plan had been to take time off after High Violet, to enjoy the high of their success a little, recharge and savour time with their partners and families after a long tour. &quot;But then,&quot; recalls Aaron, &quot;towards the end of High Violet I had some ideas and I was home and I started writing them and Matt heard them and he started writing songs immediately.&quot; One of them was the album&apos;s opener, I Should Live in Salt. &quot;And there was something about that song that made me feel like maybe we were making a record already or something. And because that song has a funny extra beat and has a different feeling to High Violet \u2013 and I think to anything else we&apos;d done \u2013 it got me kind of excited.&quot; Before they knew it, there were 25 or 30 ideas, sketches of songs \u2013 enough, Berninger reveals, that they are considering putting out another record in a year&apos;s time. Recording sessions have, in the past, been tense, but the band say there were fewer arguments this time around. &quot;On High Violet,&quot; Aaron says, &quot;Matt was pushing us towards a particular sound. So there was a little bit of a struggle, in a sense, and there were a lot of battles in that recording process. This time, there was more of a self-confidence, there wasn&apos;t as much anxiety about it, and everybody knew that each idea was strong. Generally, there wasn&apos;t a big debate.&quot;He hesitates. &quot;Though there were a couple of isolated debates. And in the vocal recording process there were a few battles. It was the last six weeks of the two months that Matt finally was singing, and at some point it seemed like he was headed in one direction in the vocals, and then he was headed in another direction, and we needed to pull it back together somehow.&quot; He gives a small, tight smile. &quot;And there was a moment of tension.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s mainly Matt and I that get into strong arguments,&quot; Aaron admits. &quot;If he&apos;s taking issue with some core idea. And, actually, it&apos;s usually that he likes the orchestration but he&apos;s extending something or he&apos;s removed a part.&quot; He looks a little testy. &quot;Now he has Garage Band he&apos;ll go in and edit it out \u2026&quot; Bryan shakes his head: &quot;It&apos;s dangerous,&quot; he says. &quot;And, all of a sudden, it gets tricky,&quot; Aaron explains, &quot;because the music doesn&apos;t have this one transition or other part that made the whole thing work, in our mind. But, actually, what I think happened with this record is we&apos;ve moved beyond a lot of the creative friction and embraced the chemistry we all have.&quot; It was the song Slipped that really swung it for him. It was, he felt, the song he had always wanted the band to write. &quot;This lugubrious, swampy ballad that Matt&apos;s voice would dominate, and just feel timeless,&quot; he explains. He rearranged the chords from one of his favourite Dylan songs, Not Dark Yet, and was pleased by the way that Berninger was able to trace the song structure&apos;s complexities and turnarounds in a natural way. &quot;It&apos;s not that the song is God&apos;s gift to songwriting or anything,&quot; he says apologetically. &quot;But it felt to me something that I&apos;d always hoped we could do.&quot; For Berninger, harbouring a new-found love of Roy Orbison melodies, the crucial song was Pink Rabbits. &quot;I\u00a0think Aaron actually regretted sending me that song,&quot; he says, &quot;because when he sent me that one I&apos;d been working on a bunch of other tracks that he&apos;d been excited about. And suddenly I just stopped in my tracks, dropped everything else and I spent three weeks only working on it because I just couldn&apos;t help it \u2013 it was a total, total obsession of mine, because I loved it.&quot; Bryce starts explaining the technicalities of how the song works, while Berninger stares at the table. &quot;It&apos;s a harmonic thing mostly,&quot; Dessner says, &quot;that song modulates in ways and it resolves in ways that have a slightly more classic American songwriting feeling about them. It has that piano melody, that lazy, swung rhythm that is comforting \u2026&quot; &quot;I have eight different versions of that song,&quot; Berninger continues. He lifts his gaze and frowns. &quot;In fact, three of the other versions are actually about death, I just remembered. But in really fun ways. And I want to put out a whole box set of them because I love them all.&quot; Bryce smiles and slides his eyes towards Berninger. &quot;A box set of death?&quot; he asks. Berninger shrugs. After all, isn&apos;t that what people expect of the National?

"article": "Herring used to be a staple fish in these isles, but it has long since been sidelined by more demure species that are less full-on fishy. That&apos;s not the case elsewhere. Scandinavians and Germans are positively obsessed with herring. Same story in Holland, where the silver darling crowds out all else on the fishmonger&apos;s slab. Stroll alongside Amsterdam&apos;s canals, and you&apos;ll catch the distinctive whiff from the city&apos;s famous stalls selling snack-size portions of succulent herring with onion pickle \u2013 a bargain at \u20ac3 a shot. The upside of Britain&apos;s cold-shouldering of this fine species, with its creamy, firm flesh and dependable flavour, is that stocks are relatively buoyant. Don&apos;t be wimpy about bones and pungent fish oil. Provided herring is sparkling-fresh and properly filleted, you&apos;re in for a treat, whether you eat it fried, chargrilled, baked or even raw. Why is herring good for me? Herring is one of the very best food sources of vitamin D. Our bodies make this vitamin in sunlight, but in our climate, it&apos;s easy not to get enough. There seems to be more to vitamin D than strong teeth and bones. It&apos;s now thought that vitamin D deficiency might be a factor in many diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes. Herring is loaded with EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). These fatty acids help prevent heart disease and keep the brain functioning properly. They also seem to be effective in reducing inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn&apos;s disease and arthritis. Where to buy and what to pay? For certainty about freshness and the reassurance of a brisk turnover, put your trust in a traditional fishmonger.

Serve with warm new potatoes dressed with a bit of mustard and a little Greek yoghurt or sour cream, accompanied by a green salad, which I dress with some of the pickling liquor and the red onions, plus a drizzle of oil.

Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. 2 Place the cider vinegar, sugar, peppercorns, bay leaves, coriander seeds and horseradish in a pan and bring to the boil. Add the rhubarb and\u00a0let it cook very gently for a few minutes. Remove from the heat. 3 Layer the herrings in a non-metallic dish. Place one layer skin-side down on the bottom, then sprinkle over the red onion, and lay the other layer on top skin-side up. 4 When the pickling liquor is warm but not hot, pour it over the fish, making sure they are fully submerged. Leave to cool completely and put in the fridge. They will be ready to eat within 3 days, but will keep for several weeks so long as the fish are submerged. \u2022 Rosie Sykes is head chef of Fitzbillies and co-author of The Kitchen Revolution (Ebury Press, \u00a327.50).

Victory, however, came at a huge cost for Chelsea, who lost John Terry and Eden Hazard to injury and finished a pulsating game with nine men. Terry departed on a stretcher, with his left leg in a brace after he collided with Nathan Baker, while Hazard pulled up with a hamstring strain in injury-time, the Belgian&apos;s pained expression shared by those on the Chelsea bench who reacted with despair. While Terry, who was jeered by the Aston Villa supporters as he left the field, was unlikely to start against Benfica in the Europa League final on Wednesday, Hazard would be nailed on to be among Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s first-choice XI. The Chelsea manager conceded that the 22-year-old&apos;s involvement in Amsterdam now looks highly unlikely. Terry, meanwhile, is undergoing a scan on his ankle. By the time Hazard signalled that he was unable to continue, Ben\u00edtez had used all three substitutes and Ramires had been dismissed after picking up two yellow cards. It was one of a number of controversial decisions that Lee Mason, the referee, made on a day when Villa also finished without their full quota of players. Christian Benteke, who had put Villa ahead with his 19th league goal of the season, was sent off in the 58th minute for a second bookable offence, his raised studs catching Terry in the ribs and bringing an automatic one-match suspension that means he will miss the game at Wigan on the final day. Villa, who remain five points clear of the relegation zone and will be safe if Wigan fail to win at Arsenal on Tuesday, could count themselves fortunate that Benteke failed to receive his marching orders earlier. Challenging for a high ball in the 38th minute, the centre forward swung an elbow that caught C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, the Chelsea right-back, in the face. If Mason saw the incident, it had to be a straight red card, yet the referee chose to only book the striker. &quot;If he has elbowed him in the face, I&apos;ll have to see it,&quot; said Paul Lambert, the Villa manager, who felt Benteke&apos;s second booking was harsh. Lambert was also angry with a contentious moment towards the end of the first half, when Terry cynically brought down Yacouba Sylla in full flight. Mason seemed to judge that Ashley Cole was in a position to get across and cover, although Lambert argued that the Villa midfielder was denied a clear goalscoring opportunity. &quot;When John Terry takes Sylla down, the full-back was not getting around in time. The referee has got to see that,&quot; Lambert said. Villa were already a goal up at that point and it was no surprise that the scorer was Benteke. The Belgium international, who was unplayable at times in the first half, challenged with Gary Cahill to knock down Brad Guzan&apos;s punt upfield and then broke into the left channel to run onto Sylla&apos;s first-time pass. He made the rest look ridiculously easy, ghosting past Cahill before beating Petr Cech with a low shot at the near post. The sense that this was going to be Villa&apos;s day was reinforced when Ramires, who had picked up an early booking for a foul on Benteke, received a second yellow card after clumsily colliding with Gabriel Agbonlahor. His boot was high but even Lambert conceded that the decision was soft. &quot;I thought the whole game the referee was poor,&quot; the Villa manager said. Benteke&apos;s dismissal felt like the turning point in the game. Chelsea drew level three minutes later, when Hazard teed up Lampard to thrash a left-footed shot past Guzan, and started to look much more dangerous against a Villa side whose counter-attacking threat had been nullified following the loss of Benteke. Chelsea should have had a second in the 72nd minute, although it was impossible to criticise the officials for failing to notice that Demba Ba had prodded the ball over the line, after Sylla blocked Cahill&apos;s shot. It took numerous television replays to prove that it was a goal, which is a debate that will be redundant next season, when goalline technology is introduced. Not that Chelsea were moaning about that moment come the end. With two minutes remaining Hazard played a neat one-two with Cole and picked out Lampard to slot home his landmark goal. He was applauded off the pitch at the end by the home fans, who moments later paid an emotional tribute to Stilian Petrov, the former Villa captain who announced his retirement on Thursday after a 15-month battle with acute leukaemia.

This time last year Drogba scored in the Champions League final before converting the shootout penalty that gave Chelsea the greatest victory in their history with what was to be his last kick for the club. Lampard draws inspiration from that even though he admits that Wednesday&apos;s Europa League final against Benfica cannot possibly confer the glory of last season&apos;s win in Munich. What is more, it will be difficult to emulate the Ivorian&apos;s outstanding performance from the bench, which is where Lampard is likely to start. Still, at least the uncertainty surrounding his future is similar to his old team-mate&apos;s predicament. &quot;Didier handled himself fantastically all last season,&quot; says Lampard. &quot;He didn&apos;t talk about [his contract], no one knew his plans until after the match and he did his stuff and left as an absolute legend as he should have done.&quot; So has Lampard been making plans that he will reveal in the aftermath of another European final, or perhaps following next Sunday&apos;s Premier League conclusion against Everton at Stamford Bridge? &quot;Not particularly, no. Kind of.&quot; Is he going to get a new contract or are these really the last days of his 12-year stint as a Chelsea player? &quot;I don&apos;t want to talk too much individually about my situation with these games to go,&quot; he replies. &quot;That would be wrong and it&apos;s actually not important in the big scheme of things. What&apos;s important is us getting the right results out of the games to qualify for the Champions League, which is the main importance for this club, and also to win in the final.&quot; While Lampard acknowledges that winning &quot;Europe&apos;s second competition&quot; would not be as significant as qualifying for the top one, it still pains him that he may not feature prominently in Amsterdam, as Juan Mata, Eden Hazard and Oscar are the clear first-choices in attacking midfield and the interim manager, Rafael Benitez, appears to prefer David Luiz, Ramires or Jon Mikel Obi in the deeper positions. Last season Lampard went into the Champions League final as captain, so going into the Europa League showdown suspecting that a meaningful cameo role is the best he can hope for has taken some mental readjustment. &quot;You have to be professional about it and work hard in training, it&apos;s a different mindset.&quot; Indeed, getting his head around the fact that the club&apos;s main remaining priority for the season is a top-four finish has also been disconcerting. &quot;I don&apos;t like fighting for the top four,&quot; says Lampard who on Saturday beat Bobby Tambling&apos;s record with his 203rd Chelsea goal after second-half strikes against Aston Villa. &quot;That&apos;s no disrespect but I&apos;m so used to fighting for top one or two and I loved that mentality we had for a good few years where second was a disappointing season. I don&apos;t like the idea of fourth being a celebration in a way. The competition does get harder and teams get harder, but I&apos;d love us to be up there again fighting to win leagues.&quot; A man who counts three Premier League titles among the 10 major honours that he has won at Chelsea is in a good position to know how close the club is to getting back to winning leagues. &quot;Not far at all,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ve got a great squad, great individual players. It&apos;s just a case of next year coming in with a mentality from pre-season where the club&apos;s going to go &apos;right, we&apos;ve got these players, we&apos;re going to get the balance right, we&apos;re going to work hard and we&apos;re going to make a challenge to go and win the league&apos;. One thing we&apos;ve lacked in the last two or three years has been consistency league-wise. That&apos;s what we need to get back.&quot; When he talks like that, it sounds as if Lampard fancies there is still a chance of securing a new deal this summer even though he will turn 35. But even if the man who made him Chelsea king returns to Stamford Bridge, he may not stay. &quot;I have a great relationship with Jos\u00e9 [Mourinho] but whether that makes any difference is only something that will become clear at the end of the season.&quot; If Chelsea do not keep him, he feels he could still serve for several seasons elsewhere and has been training to ensure longevity, adapting his routine to take account that the player who made a 164 consecutive Premier League appearances when he was in his prime has made fewer starts this season than at any time since joining Chelsea. &quot;I&apos;d love to do this for a few more years. I looked at Ryan Giggs when we played [Manchester United] last Sunday. He was as fit as a fiddle and had an aura around him. All the players there were looking up to him and he is the mark really \u2026 I adapt my training as I get a bit older \u2026 If I don&apos;t do extra bits I haven&apos;t got the edge in my game. Particularly when you do miss games, rotated in and out, if you don&apos;t do that then you can slip into a game and be more lethargic than if you were playing every game.&quot; He is, then, ready for the next game and while the Europa League may not make for the dream farewell, losing it would be a nightmare. &quot;You remember the finals you lose as much as the ones you win,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone&apos;s talking about Chelsea getting to a final and thinking we&apos;ve almost done it but we know what a tough game&apos;s it&apos;s going to be.

The prime minister came forward to condemn Mantel&apos;s remarks, in her LRB essay, as &quot;misguided&quot; and &quot;completely wrong&quot;. On the occasions when he had met Mantel&apos;s victim, the prime minister had found her nothing like a &quot;shop-window mannequin&quot;. &quot;This is someone who&apos;s bright, who&apos;s engaging, who&apos;s a fantastic ambassador for Britain.&quot; Even the late Princess Diana, when she actually was a fantastic ambassador for Britain, never had such champions.

As for her adversary, Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles, now the Duchess of Cornwall, there was a time when Charles&apos;s mistress doubled as a kind of national pillory, which would have been staggeringly misogynistic if so much abuse had not come from women, who hated her out of loyalty to Diana. After her embedded role in their marriage was confirmed in the early 90s, first by the princess in her collaboration with Andrew Morton, then by the Prince of Wales in a television interview, Camilla must have dreamed of being called a gloss-varnished, shop-window mannequin with a plastic smile. As opposed to the &quot;wicked witch of Wiltshire&quot;, a horse, a haddock, a trout, the most hated woman in England aka &quot;the rottweiler&quot; (Diana&apos;s name for her). Even her friends, in newspaper profiles, would explain that part of Camilla&apos;s whole appeal was her relaxed, bucolic, un-paranoid (NB, Diana, you nutter) approach to dress and personal hygiene. &quot;She is quite happy to jump off her horse and into an evening dress without having a bath,&quot; one fatally disclosed; the story would be endlessly rehearsed in evidence of the witch&apos;s low habits. Her critics also fell upon a Jilly Cooper anecdote, offered by way of a compliment: &quot;When you stay with her she wanders about at breakfast in her dressing gown, wearing no make-up and her nail varnish is chipped.&quot; Whatever her current breakfasting outfits, the duchess&apos;s preparations for meeting subjects \u2013 who once pelted her with bread rolls, hissed at the sound of her name \u2013 have become progressively more Diana-like. Courtesy of the Daily Mail, whose sternest vigilantes are now repeatedly knocked out by Camilla&apos;s hair/dresses/skin tone, her ever-increasing plasticity and glossiness can be authoritatively attributed to yoga, pilates, bigger hair, highlights, a travelling hairdresser, gowns by Bruce Oldfield and, even, channelling Diana, her own &quot;guru&quot;, a specialist in bee-venom facials. &quot;Camilla, the dazzling Duchess&quot;, was the culminating headline in her rehabilitation. If this doting coverage really is attributable to careful grooming, as opposed to the increasingly blinding effect of royal goggles, as Prince Charles lurches towards power, its effects must be inspirational to anyone suffering ostensibly terminal career damage, not to mention everyone over 40. If you weren&apos;t there at the time, immersed in stories about dressing gowns and chipped nail-varnish, one clue to the scale of Camilla&apos;s transformation into, as the Mail believes, an icon of preternatural sixtysomething loveliness, is the passage in Cold Comfort Farm when the entrance of a stylishly made-over Mrs Starkadder, aged 80, elicits from her astonished family cries such as: &quot;Tes terrible&quot; and: &quot;Tes flying in the face of Nature&quot;. In a letter to Diana, a consoling Prince Philip once wrote: &quot;I cannot imagine anyone in their right mind leaving you for Camilla.&quot; Alternatively, to comprehend the magic of the duchess&apos;s emergence as the incandescent face of bee-venom, think of her as a misunderstood Nanny McPhee, gradually shedding warts and hairs until, among fellow royals in Amsterdam, she finally appears as a fine, brilliantly complexioned woman, whose blemishes were only a metaphor for public ignorance. After Diana&apos;s death, one measure of public loss was the refreshed abomination of Camilla, soon to be intensified by various new accounts of the Wales&apos; marriage in which she was depicted, in an echo of Les liaisons dangereuses, as a creepy manipulatrix, picking out a guileless virgin who suited her purposes. A new volley of insults, with a more radical flavour, reflected that, worse than frayed around the edges, Camilla now looked coldly calculating. A revised edition of Morton&apos;s book had Diana describing the marital &quot;rage, rage, rage&quot; engendered by the affair. To people who thought the British relationship with its royals had changed forever, post Diana, it tended to be obvious that, even if the public one day forgave the Windsors for torturing the princess, no such pardon would be in order for principal suspect, Camilla Parker Bowles. Well, not for a while. And definitely not, clerics as well as Diana loyalists insisted, if she ever got any ideas about being queen. Six years after Diana&apos;s death, in Camilla: An Intimate Portrait, the first significant book about the duchess, Rebecca Tyrrel noted that it was still unthinkable for Camilla to walk alongside her boyfriend, or to be seen in a tiara, like a proper royal. Charles had one he had bought as a themed royal-mistress gift, the Keppel tiara, tactfully turned into a necklace. Maybe he should get it turned back? If the Thatcher obsequies had not confirmed how long memories and grudges can last, the complete rehabilitation of the Duchess of Cornwall, her right to a throne now finally unquestioned, might say something about the speed of public forgetting. There might be a lesson, too, on the advisability for those who wish to be remembered, of memorials more personal than Diana&apos;s enormous Hyde Park footbath. In fact, to look at her principal monuments \u2013 a water feature and a playground, a walk and a gate \u2013 is to wonder, momentarily, how the royals, cunning as ever, pulled off the Ozymandias-trumping feat of denying her bereft fans even one lifelike memorial. But at the time these monuments were established, the whole country was supposed to be Diana&apos;s shrine; the newly sensitised national character and humbled condition of the royal family would preserve her memory. Reflecting, a year later, on Diana&apos;s allegedly enlightening legacy, Andrew Marr argued, persuasively: &quot;The shift of tone is here for good.&quot; Perhaps the state opening of parliament is the wrong place to look for evidence of that shift, and there is nothing to learn from the drooling press coverage, as our set of replacement monarchs mirrors the Queen and Prince Philip, in a ceremony that was said in less deferential times to be unthinkable.

The rhythmic percussion of countless cicadas is replaced by the sweet pulsations of a dozen violins, their melody winding up into the hot Italian night like clouds of perfumed incense. Where harsh German voices once barked orders and dusty boots shuffled and stamped, tonight there is\u00a0only the serene mystery that is music, its soothing balm consigning fear to distant, painful memory. And what music. Those Nazi officers who drove into the sunlit quad at the heart of the Tuscan edifice of La Foce would have been appalled to know it\u00a0would later resound to their notion\u00a0of degenerate art. There is a\u00a0sense of quiet triumph in listening\u00a0to Schoenberg&apos;s Transfigured Night in this setting \u2013 such an elegant repudiation of a\u00a0grotesque, twisted\u00a0ideology. When Hitler&apos;s dirty and dishevelled troops arrived at Anglo-American writer and scholar Iris Origo&apos;s vast Val d&apos;Orcia estate in 1944 they were already on the run, desperate and dangerous, being forced up through Italy by the Allies&apos; slow and costly advance. With partisans in the woods above the house and Canadians and Scots Guards inching towards them, La Foce found itself caught in the middle. Children evacuated from Turin were sheltering in the cellars and escaped prisoners-of-war hiding in the attics; they were extremely dangerous times, bravely recorded\u00a0with clarity and honesty by\u00a0Origo in her famous diary, War in the Val d&apos;Orcia.  When the fighting became intense, and La Foce looked as if it might be directly in the crossfire, Origo felt she had no choice but to move the frightened and distressed children. With all transport requisitioned and no petrol anyway, they simply walked all day across the battlefield, shells falling all around them, to the hilltop town of Montepulciano, hiding amid the crops and ditches to avoid menacing aircraft and columns of German troops. Somehow, this extraordinary party of 28 children, four babies and some 20 adults made it to safety, with the people of Montepulciano coming out to greet them with open arms.     Music in the courtyard at La Foce.    The drama of those war years and Iris&apos;s own, sometimes tragic, life was captured last year in the first performance of a new piece based on her writings, The Land to Life Again, which brought to a close the annual festival of music staged at La Foce \u2013 just one of many classic festivals across the country that can make a visit to already special Italy even more rewarding for keen music-lovers. The young Italian composer and conductor Francesco Cilluffo wrote the song cycle while staying on the estate and was clearly inspired by the beauty and history around him and by the quality of Origo&apos;s writing. &quot;I wanted to get the feel of the landscape in the music,&quot; he told me. &quot;I wanted to try to describe how the rhythm of life was cruelly interrupted, and yet out of all that destruction and hurt came a message of deep humanity and renewal.&quot; The piece, given its premiere by the soprano Nuccia Focile and young players from the UCLA Camarades, tells of Origo&apos;s struggles to regenerate the estate&apos;s exhausted farmland in the 1930s, her desire to establish her now famous garden, the privations of war and the personal tragedy of losing a son to meningitis \u2013 a passage written as a duet for voice and cello, poignantly played on this occasion by her grandson, the cellist Antonio Lysy, who also runs the festival. He has great vision for music in this wildly beautiful region (south of Siena and west of Chiusi) and told me he wants one day to stage an opera based on the war diary at the Teatro Policiano in Montepulciano, where Origo finally managed to house the children safely after their dangerous march. With a starry list of patrons including Vladimir Ashkenazy, Charles Dutoit, Hans Werner Henze and Maurizio Pollini, his ambitions might be realised, and not only in music. Hollywood has expressed interest in the diary, too. That could explain Colin Firth&apos;s name among the patrons. Francesco Cilluffo returns this year when the Incontri in Terra di Siena, to give it its full title, will be celebrating its 25th anniversary. He&apos;ll be conducting Wagner&apos;s Siegfried Idyll in a festival that features the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, the pianist Andrew von Oeyen and the extrovert Baroque quartet Red Priest. Music from Bach and Vivaldi to Verdi and Piazzolla will be heard in the buildings and gardens of the estate and in the castles and churches of the Val d&apos;Orcia from 19 to 28 July. When Antonio and Iris Origo bought the estate in 1924 they found a beautiful but derelict landscape peopled by illiterate peasants living in great poverty. They set about building new farmhouses, a school for the children and a clinic and social club, now an attractive restaurant called Dopolavoro. Today, one of the 1930s farmhouses is a small hotel. La Bandita lies above La Foce, up what is probably one of Italy&apos;s most famous roads, reproduced on millions of postcards and on thousands of calendars. It winds in S-bends up a hillside, cypress trees standing sentinel at its side, a perfect depiction of all things Tuscan. It looks idyllic, but in truth it&apos;s merciless. Imagine driving over a rocky beach\u00a0to get to your hotel and you have some idea of the condition of the\u00a0road. It was made by Antonio and his men from great boulders and chunks of stone and took me 45 minutes to negotiate the three miles in my faithful VW. It&apos;s a serious impediment to anyone wanting to tour the region. Once you arrive, a\u00a0little shaken, you are rewarded with\u00a0a spectacular view of the Val d&apos;Orcia, its mysterious treeless landscape unforgiving in the hot summer sun or the snows of winter. And the prices are equally unforgiving. A room for the night costs \u20ac295-\u20ac395 in high season: the pigsty suite, \u20ac495-\u20ac595. The impoverished farmers of the 1930s would surely gasp in disbelief. Essentials For more information on the Incontri in Terra di Siena, go to itslafoce.org. La Foce is 60km south of Siena.

A European trophy to go with a top-four finish would allow Ben\u00edtez to enjoy a moment of quiet satisfaction on the final day of the season, as he prepares to close the door on the club where he has never felt welcome. As far as the Spaniard is concerned, qualification for the Champions League, which was his primary objective when he replaced Roberto Di Matteo in November, is already a tick in the box. &quot;I am really proud, not just for me but for my staff and everyone involved because we have been working very hard from the beginning and you know that it was not the perfect environment,&quot; Ben\u00edtez said. &quot;I remember in England some managers, with hostility in the stands, they couldn&apos;t cope with this situation.&quot; The abuse has been brutal at times, although Ben\u00edtez, who believes there has been &quot;a big improvement&quot; in the team since he took over, claimed there was also respect among Chelsea supporters for his work at the club. &quot;I receive a lot of messages on the website, and people on the street, when you go and meet them they say: &apos;Well done, good job.&apos; A lot of Chelsea fans appreciate what we are trying to do. You cannot convince everyone, but you can see the commitment of the players and that they are happy with the\u00a0situation.&quot; There was certainly no shortage of desire at Villa Park, where Chelsea&apos;s dramatic win came\u00a0at a high price. John Terry was taken off on a stretcher after injuring an ankle and Eden Hazard, who has been one of Chelsea&apos;s most influential players this season, pulled a hamstring in stoppage\u00a0time. It is highly unlikely either will be fit to play against Benfica in the Europa League final, when Ben\u00edtez must decide whether to find a place in his starting lineup for Frank Lampard.     Chelsea's Frank Lampard, right, celebrates his first goal in the Premier League match against Aston Villa at Villa Park. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images    On this evidence it is difficult to see how Lampard, who has not been a mandatory pick under Ben\u00edtez, can be overlooked. With two goals in the second half, the 34-year-old became Chelsea&apos;s all-time leading scorer, surpassing Bobby Tambling&apos;s record of 202 goals for the club. It is an astonishing achievement by a midfielder and was recognised by the Aston Villa supporters, who gave Lampard an ovation as he left the pitch at the end of a breathless encounter. &quot;That was a real honour because it doesn&apos;t always happen that way,&quot; Lampard said. With 15 league goals to his name this season in only 20 starts, it seems incredible that Chelsea&apos;s hierarchy are still undecided whether to give him a new contract or allow him to leave on a free transfer. &quot;My eyes are very wide open,&quot; Lampard said. &quot;I think the club are making the right decisions and I hope to stay. Simple as that. We&apos;ve got two big games coming up. Nothing will happen in that period of time but at the end of those games I hope to sit down. That&apos;s my wish and I have made that very clear for a long time.&quot; Villa still have their own future to worry about after a defeat that was hard to stomach. After going ahead as a result of Christian Benteke&apos;s fine goal and playing against 10 men after Ramires was sent off, Villa were in charge until their Belgium striker, who had been lucky to escape a straight red card for elbowing C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta earlier in the game, was dismissed for a second booking. Benteke will now miss the final match at Wigan, where Villa&apos;s Premier League status will be on the line if Roberto Mart\u00ednez&apos;s side beat Arsenal on Tuesday.

Against Aston Villa on Saturday Lampard struck twice to surpass Bobby Tambling and become Chelsea&apos;s all-time leading goalscorer. His two second-half goals also guaranteed Chelsea a top-four finish, securing another season of Champions League football. In fact just about the only issue that wasn&apos;t put to bed on Saturday was Lampard&apos;s future. He spoke afterwards about his desire to stay with the club for another season yet from Chelsea there was only silence. All of which seems increasingly bizarre. Forget that Lampard is 34 years of age. Ignore the fact that he has scored more goals in a Chelsea shirt that any other player. Just take this season in isolation: Lampard has scored 15 goals in only 20 Premier League starts. Across his 12-year Chelsea career he has only bettered that goal return in two seasons (in the title winning campaigns of 2005-06 and 2009-10) and yet he has never started so few games for Chelsea in a league campaign before or spent so much time on the bench. In other words, Lampard hardly looks like a spent force. Roman Abramovich has made many unfathomable decisions during his time at Chelsea but this could top the lot if the England international leaves on a free transfer in the summer. Stuart James 2) Hornets buzzing  Whatever the result at Wembley, and whatever you think about the manner in which the squad has been gathered together, Watford will grace the national stadium in the Championship play-off final after beating Leicester over two legs. Gianfranco Zola&apos;s side play genuinely attractive passing football, and as the Italian has respectfully pointed out, has rarely seemed to get their just desserts from the officials in recent months. In that respect at least, their progress is fully deserved. And who knows, perhaps if they do go up, something will actually be done about the state of Vicarage Road. Richard Rae 3) Norwich put holiday plans on hold  It was clear from the first minute that Norwich meant business against West Brom, whose players are admittedly wiling away the time before they can jet off on their summer holidays. Chris Hughton has been criticised by Norwich&apos;s fans for his cautious style, yet here was evidence that they are capable of attacking with verve while keeping it tight at the back. With Jonny Howson setting a brisk tempo and Robert Snodgrass and Anthony Pilkington full of direct and inventive running on the flanks, Norwich were rewarded with their biggest win in the Premier League since a 5-1 win at Everton in September 1993. Jacob Steinberg  4) Harper will receive a fitting send-off The first reaction to Rob Elliot&apos;s 80th-minute misjudgement at Queens Park Rangers that saw him receive a second yellow card was to lament Newcastle United&apos;s ability to make things difficult for themselves. When Steve Harper came on, there was then the situation of the club having to rely upon a goalkeeper with whose services they have already decided to dispense at the end of the season. But after they closed out the victory that they needed to banish the spectre of relegation, there was an uplifting spin-off story regarding Harper, whose contract will expire in the summer and not be renewed. With Tim Krul injured and Elliot banned, Harper will start the season&apos;s final game against Arsenal at St James&apos; Park, which stands to be a stress-free and &quot;enjoyable&quot; occasion, according to Alan Pardew. Newcastle can be expected to give Harper the captaincy and the fans will respond to the loyal club servant of 20 years. David Hytner 5) Liverpool&apos;s smoking area It may have been dangerous and, quite literally, got up the noses of Fulham&apos;s supporters, but the red smoke that billowed from the visiting section at Craven Cottage on Sunday was undeniably a sight that grabbed the eye. Liverpool&apos;s travelling fans have become quite fond of pyrotechnics this season, in part as a response to the sterile atmosphere that has become the norm at Anfield. The fireworks have now been put away for the summer but staff at Premier League grounds up and down the country should brace themselves for more of the same next year. Sachin Nakrani  6) Tony Pulis knows his history Stoke celebrated their 150th birthday before the match against Tottenham Hotspur and it is interesting to reflect how their club has evolved in a century and a half. Consider, in particular, the influence of two famous incidents involving the Potters in the late 19th century. In the 1891 FA Cup quarter-final, Stoke were denied a goal by a foul on the line \u2013 since there were no penalty kicks at the time, Notts County were able to crowd the goal and render Stoke&apos;s free-kick useless. That helped bring about the invention of penalties. Then, in a match against Aston Villa, Stoke were chasing an equaliser and were awarded a spot-kick when another of their players was fouled in the last minute \u2013 but the Villa keeper whacked the ball out of the ground and by the time it was recovered, the match was over. This led to the introduction of another new law, allowing for stoppage time to be added so that penalties could be taken. So it is clear that Stoke have a long and proud tradition of ensuring that skill trumps spoiling tactics. Needless to say, they remain passionately committed to upholding that. Paul Doyle 7) Short&apos;s brave risk saved Sunderland Hats off to Ellis Short, Sunderland&apos;s owner. It was a necessary decision to replace Martin O&apos;Neill in March but it was a brave decision to appoint Paolo Di Canio as his managerial successor. After a 1-1 draw with Southampton, Sunderland are not quite safe yet but Short has already been vindicated. By the time most people, let alone ex-professional footballers, approach their 45th birthdays, they are invariably deeply cynical and big on compromise. Not so Di Canio. Unusually honest, open, candid and above all, principled \u2013 yes, I believe his political beliefs are misunderstood \u2013 he is a rare creature and precisely what Sunderland need. Not for nothing did he score record top marks in his coaching badges. Short has potentially captured the new Brian Clough, the man Roy Keane briefly promised to be but clearly was not. Hats off, too, to Sunderland&apos;s brilliant goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and Danny Rose, the left back who has spent the season at the Stadium of Light on loan from Tottenham Hotspur. Without the admirable contributions of those two, the Wearsiders would have been sunk without trace long before Di Canio came on the scene. Louise Taylor 8) SuperLiga by name, super league by nature On a weekend that provided no shortage of &quot;football, bloody hell&quot; moments, few were more jaw-dropping than the thrilling climax of FC Porto&apos;s match against Benfica in Portugal&apos;s top flight on Saturday night. With both teams unbeaten in the league and Benfica two points clear of their rivals, the match was ostensibly a title decider that Porto had to win. In added time at Porto&apos;s Dragao Stadium, things were looking good for Benfica, with the score tied at one goal apiece \u2026 until 19-year-old Porto substitute Kelvin struck a fine late, late winner to win his side all three points and putting them in the box-seat to win their third consecutive title with just one game to go. In his technical area, Benfica&apos;s traumatised manager Jorge Jesus sank to his knees, his ashen face a study in horror and disbelief at what he had just witnessed unfold. With the small matter of a Europa League final to contest against Chelsea on Wednesday, it will be intriguing to see which Benfica turns up in Amsterdam: a highly motivated outfit playing with renewed vigour and determination to salvage something from the weekend wreckage, or a dispirited rabble still reeling from such a brutal hammer-blow. Football, bloody hell. Barry Glendenning 9) Wales readies itself for next season&apos;s big and ugly battle Results elsewhere confirmed Swansea City&apos;s place in the Premier League&apos;s top 10 and a finish in eighth place is still possible for Michael Laudrup&apos;s side, with the manager quick to remind the media: &quot;We have the lowest budget in the league so maybe where we are is an even bigger result than winning the [League] Cup.&quot; It&apos;s a huge achievement in only their second Premier League season and their fans will be in ecstatic mood if Fulham can be defeated at the Liberty Stadium next Sunday. But excitement on that match day will be fleeting \u2013 something far bigger and far uglier is on its way. Bitter, deep-running rivalry between Swansea and Cardiff City will shortly be all-consuming along the Glamorganshire coast now that the side from the Welsh capital is joining the Premier League. Swansea have won 20 of the sides&apos; league meetings, compared to Cardiff&apos;s 18, with a further 16 drawn. Laudrup insists he will still be managing the Swans next season, but no doubt he has been warned that the big pressure will be on for top billing on the Welsh stretch of the M4. Chris Corrigan 10) Mirallas shows the way forward David Moyes is often portrayed as a manager whose talents lie more with stopping goals than creating them, at a club which still feeds off memories of Ball, Harvey, Kendall, Royle and Young. Well, Everton&apos;s opening goal in the 2-0 defeat of West Ham was a throwback to those glory days, and emphasised the skills laced through the current team. Baines, Pienaar and Fellaini cut open the Hammers&apos; defence before Kevin Mirallas eased the ball home. Moyes enjoyed the moment, and his successor&apos;s first task will be to prevent the Scot persuading any member of this foursome to follow him down the M62.

I&apos;d fallen foul of the previous version when returning from Paris on the Eurostar a few weeks ago. Arriving at the barriers with my bike in its bag, which I&apos;d taken by Eurostar many times before, I was told that it was now deemed too large to carry on, and I had to pay \u20ac29 to send it freight instead. Afterwards, I spoke to Eurostar, who said the policy was being reviewed, but the newest bike policy is disappointing: only bikes in bags up to 85cm in length can be carried on, which means it&apos;s impossible to take a non-folding bike as carry-on luggage. Instead, you must pay \u00a310 (\u20ac15 on the continent) to &quot;turn-up-and-go&quot;, and leave your bike bag at a counter in the check-in hall; you will then be reunited at Paris, Brussels or, I am told, Lille. That station is a trickier proposition for baggage since it&apos;s an intermediate stop, but it&apos;s also vital to connect to the best train services to the south of France. Eurostar believes it will be able to meet demand, but it can&apos;t guarantee 100% the bike will travel on the same train as you \u2013 which seems pretty unfriendly for people taking onward connections. If you&apos;re not willing to run that (admittedly small) risk, you must book your bike in advance as registered baggage for \u00a325. You can also wheel it to the freight depot, unbagged, for \u00a325 (\u00a330 to guarantee it on your train). The Eurostar website doesn&apos;t explain any of this very well at the moment, but I&apos;m assured that this is all how it works. Eurostar bills itself as a convenient, pleasant alternative to air travel to Europe, and the previous carry-on service was just that. A bag within the regulations fitted neatly on to the luggage racks. Generally, outside of peak times there&apos;d be plenty of space, but if the racks were full there was room to slide it in on top of everyone else&apos;s stuff. It&apos;s always annoying to have to pay for something you used to get for free. But what was best about the previous system was that you could keep an eye on your bike the whole way, and didn&apos;t have to entrust it to baggage handlers - a massive advantage over air travel. I&apos;d travelled more than 20 times over the past few years, taking my road bike to the south of France to sneak in rides around working at conferences, and my commuter bike to Paris, Amsterdam and Antwerp for work or for weekend breaks. Not once did I see a bike bag causing any inconvenience on the trains. Eurostar&apos;s regulations on bike bags now places it out of step with all of the high-speed trains it connects with \u2013 hardly the sort of joined-up thinking we need to promote rail as the convenient, sustainable alternative to flying. (However, if you&apos;re lucky enough to be on a direct Eurostar to Provence or the Alps, you can still take a 120cm bike bag on board.) It&apos;s a shame, and a complication for people travelling to cycle on the continent, be that for a sportive, a city break or touring holiday. I&apos;ve spoken to several people who have already made alternative arrangements. One man travelling to the \u00c9tape had reluctantly booked a flight when it wasn&apos;t clear how he&apos;d make his train trip; and a couple who were worried that their specially modified tandem (to take account of a disability) wouldn&apos;t be looked after by the freight service were taking a ferry instead. Dave Holladay is an integrated transport specialist working with national cycling charity CTC and public transport operators on integrating cycling with public transport. He said:  &quot;It&apos;s not an ideal solution but it is one we can work with. It is too early to judge whether the promise of getting the bags collected at check-in on to the same train as the passenger can be met, and I expect some fine tuning will be needed.&quot;  A Eurostar spokesperson I talked to said the problem wasn&apos;t bike bags specifically: with passenger numbers rising all the time, it was the sheer amount of luggage. The new restrictions are in fact part of a policy limiting general luggage to two items up to 85cm per person.  &quot;It is important to balance the needs of all of our passengers and the changes we have made to our baggage policy have been designed to reduce the amount of oversized or excess baggage being taken on board. By doing so, we are able to continue to offer all passengers a generous and free individual luggage allowance while offering a number of options to those passengers who may have bulkier items of luggage.&quot;  So Eurostar is a victim of its own success. But cyclists have been a significant part of that, and it seems a shame their lives are being made more difficult. There&apos;s no doubt there&apos;s a substantial market. In 2007, Holladay and CTC worked with Eurostar to introduce a booking system so passengers could take complete bikes with them to the continent \u2013 and demand shot up 1,000% in three years. &quot;Most rail operators seriously underestimate the potential for connecting cycling with rail travel,&quot; Holladay said.

While he is expected to fly with the team on Tuesday morning, the coaching staff do not anticipate having him available for the game.

Kicking off a public campaign for a network of long-haul airports to serve the UK, Birmingham is releasing research that highlights its position in Britain&apos;s industrial heartland. The airport says it has the second largest business catchment in the UK and the biggest number of manufacturers. Paul Kehoe, the airport&apos;s chief executive, argues that if the government is to fulfil its promise to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing and exports the country&apos;s aviation strategy needs to better serve businesses in the industrial heartland. &quot;This report shows that a surprisingly high proportion of the country&apos;s potential demand for business air travel comes from Birmingham airport&apos;s catchment area. But rather than flying from their local airport, we have ended up with an illogical situation where these businesses have to slog down the M1 or M40 to get to Heathrow \u2013 leaving them with huge time and cost implications and adding to the congestion at our London airports,&quot; he said. The report, carried out by Capital Economics, found that more than half a million businesses are within the Birmingham airport catchment \u2013 around one quarter of all Britain&apos;s businesses. It highlights strong demand for flights to Asia and the Middle East from them, but says they are forced to travel from airports in the south. Local businesses have argued that the aviation industry needs to operate more long-haul flights out of Birmingham, especially once a runway extension is completed next year. Steve Brittan, whose manufacturing company BSA Machine Tools does 90% of its trade overseas, says with the domestic and eurozone economies struggling he is increasingly looking for business further afield. He travels out of Birmingham rather than Heathrow, but has to spend time changing planes in cities such as Amsterdam. &quot;Currently we have to fly via European hubs to connect with our customers that are located globally in Asia and the Americas. These difficulties can put off overseas customers visiting our plant in Birmingham,&quot; he said. &quot;This is the heart of manufacturing here and if we are serious about things \u2026 we need an international airport.&quot; The report also highlights obstacles for business travellers coming into the UK, noting that Birmingham airport&apos;s catchment was the destination for a quarter of all foreign direct investment that came into Britain in 2011. Peter Mathews at Black Country Metals argues that the current focus of the aviation industry on Heathrow is costing companies outside London business. &quot;There are people who come to London and won&apos;t travel up to Birmingham, and that is a problem. Manufacturing is not in London, it&apos;s in the Midlands and further north,&quot; he said. The research was commissioned by Birmingham airport to help form its response to the Sir Howard Davies commission into aviation capacity, which is not due to report until June 2015, after the next general election. Davies has promised, however, that his interim findings in late 2013 will significantly narrow down the options for potential airport expansion.", "sentences": ["He travels out of Birmingham rather than Heathrow, but has to spend time changing planes in cities such as Amsterdam."], "title": "Birmingham airport calls for UK-wide aviation expansion to help economy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/14/birmingham-airport-call-aviation-expansion-economy", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Transport policy", "Manufacturing sector", "Business", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Economics", "Birmingham", "UK news", "Transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-14T10:46:31Z", "article": "Benfica trust that a coach named Jesus can lead them out of the continental wilderness. On Wednesday night in Amsterdam, Jorge Jesus will attempt to outwit Chelsea&apos;s Rafael Ben\u00edtez as Portugal&apos;s most glamorous club strive to win their first European prize for 51 years. Should Jesus succeed in securing the Europa League trophy, he will be seen as having finally lifted the curse of Bela Guttmann. For some time now Benfica fans have regularly laid flowers at Guttmann&apos;s graveside in Vienna in the hope that such gestures might somehow invalidate a chilling, five-decade-old pledge made by the coach who led the Lisbon side to two successive European Cup triumphs in 1961 and 1962. A Hungarian Jew who survived the Holocaust and began his working life as a dance instructor, Guttmann was a brilliant tactician, credited with inventing 4-4-2 while managing Brazil&apos;s S\u00e3o Paulo in the 1950s before showcasing Eus\u00e9bio&apos;s extraordinary skills in a fabulous Benfica team. After Barcelona fell to the Portuguese side in the 1961 final, Real Madrid were vanquished a year later with Eus\u00e9bio scoring twice as Benfica prevailed 5-3 \u2013 coincidentally in Amsterdam. At the end, Real&apos;s Ferenc Puskas, handed his shirt to Eus\u00e9bio and, as the 20-year-old from Mozambique grasped hold of it, a baton appeared to have been passed. Who knows what heights Benfica might have subsequently hit but Guttmann \u2013 an always prickly personality whose first act in Lisbon was to fire 20 players \u2013 promptly demanded a pay rise and when directors turned him down he stomped off in a huff. Even worse, the coach&apos;s parting shot was a claim that the team from the Est\u00e1dio da Luz would pay for their folly by never experiencing European glory again. Guttmann&apos;s words seemed horribly prophetic when, in 1990, now under Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson&apos;s tutelage, Benfica lost a fifth post-1962 European Cup final final this time to Milan following defeats in 1963, 1965, 1968 \u2013 against Manchester United \u2013 and 1988. The 23 years which followed produced no more European showpieces but have seen Benfica emerge from a debilitating financial crisis, while somehow retaining their cherished image as one of the world game&apos;s classier outfits. This latter quality sees paying supporters \u2013 or S\u00f3cios \u2013 elect club presidents and was much in evidence ahead of the second-leg of this season&apos;s Europa League quarter-final at Newcastle United. Shortly before kick off, Jesus headed a visiting delegation which laid flowers at the feet of the statue of Sir Bobby Robson which stands just outside St James&apos; Park. During his days in charge of Porto and Sporting Lisbon, Robson delighted in complicating life for Benfica, and Jesus, whose four seasons in the job make him the longest serving coach at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz since the 1950s, was determined to pay his respects. Disappointed as Robson would have been to see Newcastle bow out, he would have been impressed by the spontaneous standing ovation the Gallowgate End afforded Benfica&apos;s technically accomplished team at the end of a tight, utterly compelling tie. Watching Jesus&apos;s class of 2013 is invariably a bewitching experience and not merely due to Glory and Victory; the magnificent eagles-cum-club mascots who live at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz \u2013 one of which flies imperiously around the stands, circling the ground before kick-off at every home game. &quot;I don&apos;t think many better sides than Benfica have played at St James&apos; Park in recent years,&quot; says Alan Pardew, Newcastle&apos;s manager and a fairly frequent visitor to Lisbon who never fails to stop outside the Est\u00e1dio da Luz and admire the statue of Eus\u00e9bio \u2013 (now aged 71 and still an ardent fan). &quot;They have a slightly different style to that of a Premier League team and possess some fantastic technical players like Nicol\u00e1s Gait\u00e1n, Rodrigo, \u00d3scar Cardozo and Lima. &quot;They&apos;ve got a lot of flair and pace, very progressive full-backs and varied attacking options. Benfica are difficult to contain and a real threat on the counter-attack.&quot; Jesus&apos;s team are also rather good at retaining possession and much of this is down to Nemanja Matic, who has evolved from being the makeweight in the deal which took David Luiz from Libson to London two seasons ago, into one of Europe&apos;s most coveted central midfielders. &quot;The way Benfica keep the ball \u2013 and Matic in particular \u2013 is fantastic,&quot; enthuses Pardew. &quot;Matic has really grown since he left Chelsea; he&apos;s a terrific player now.&quot; His development has certainly been timely. Last summer Jesus was forced to sell Axel Witsel and Javi Garc\u00eda, then his two key central midfielders, to Zenit St Petersburg and Manchester City respectively for a combined fee of almost \u00a350m. Despite its huge South American fanbase, Benfica is far from immune from the Eurozone crisis which has hit Portugal particularly hard, and it would be no surprise were Matic to move on this summer. While Manchester United have been watching the Serb \u2013 dubbed &apos;The Spider&apos; due to his seemingly telescopic legs \u2013 in recent months, Cardoza has been busy giving defenders the slip, scoring 31 times in 42 appearances this season. Two second-leg goals from the 6ft 4in, predominantly left-footed Paraguayan \u2013 nicknamed Tacuara or Big Cane - helped overcome Fenerbahce in the Europa League semi-final but, like his team-mates, Cardozo juggles sometimes conflicting priorities. Indeed the twin demands of pursuing European and domestic glory appear to be stretching Jesus&apos;s personnel to their limit, as their once apparently unassailable lead at the top of the Premeira Liga has, almost imperceptibly, dwindled away and they now stand second, one point behind Porto with one game remaining. On Saturday night, Benfica limbered up for Amsterdam by losing top spot in a 2-1 defeat at Porto which could prove pivotal. As his side succumbed to a stoppage time winner, Jesus sank to his knees in disbelief on the sidelines. Earlier this season, he vowed not to &quot;compromise&quot; Benfica&apos;s title hopes but the 58-year-old also harbours an ambition to follow his compatriots Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 who, incidentally, lasted a matter of months as coach at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz in 2000 \u2013 and Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas to the Premier League.

Prominent backbenchers Douglas Carswell, Michael Fabricant and Zac Goldsmith swung behind the prime minister&apos;s surprise initiative, saying the task now was to find a Tory MP to back the bill at the private member&apos;s bill ballot on Thursday and then to challenge Ed Miliband to support it at a second reading. Carswell said: &quot;The chance to engineer a vote now is ours for the making.&quot; But the leader of the revolt, John Baron, said he was not going to withdraw his planned amendment regretting the contents of the Queen&apos;s speech. Influential figures around Ed Miliband are urging him to exploit the chance to embarrass Cameron by backing a referendum, but Tuesday&apos;s shadow cabinet meeting was expected to endorse the policy of opposing the amendment. Miliband is determined to be seen to be acting in the national interest on Europe. The prime minister&apos;s spokesman said ministers would be expected to abstain, since although Conservative policy is to back a draft bill, government policy does not support the measure. He said the amendment was Conservative policy. He said the prime minister was happy that it could be seen he was leading the calls for a referendum, and denied that his actions merely demonstrated his weakness, or that his weakness reminded voters of John Major&apos;s battles with his Eurosceptics. In a sign of the contorted position created by coalition politics, the prime minister&apos;s spokesman said the amendment &quot;clearly is in line with Conservative party policy&quot; and it would be difficult for Tory members of the government to vote against it. &quot;Because at present it is not government policy, because we are in a coalition government, it would put ministers in a difficult position if they were asked to vote against the government&apos;s own Queen&apos;s speech or to vote against Conservative party policy. Hence the ability to abstain.&quot; The amendment regretting the absence of a referendum bill in the Queen&apos;s speech, signed by as many as 80 Tory MPs, is due to be debated on Wednesday. In response, Cameron, seeking to quell accusations of weakness and a surge in support for Ukip, is to publish his own draft bill introducing an in/out referendum on Tuesday. The prime minister had previously pledged to hold a referendum in 2017 but the lack of a commitment in the legislative agenda, in the face of Lib Dem opposition, prompted unrest among backbench Tory MPs witnessing a growing threat from Ukip. The foreign secretary, William Hague, defended the prime minister&apos;s move. He said Cameron&apos;s draft bill, which is likely to be tabled by a backbencher as a private member&apos;s bill, would &quot;entrench&quot; the party&apos;s commitment to holding a vote in 2017 and force the other parties &quot;to decide definitively their position&quot;. &quot;Of course that is a much more difficult route than [government] legislation but it means that there \u2026 can be a debate in the House of Commons on our policy, it means there can be a vote,&quot; he told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme. &quot;What we are doing is strengthening our commitment [to a referendum] \u2026 when you can do something to make clearer, to entrench a commitment, you should do that.&quot; Hague emphasised that Cameron was forced to go down the route of tabling his own draft bill because the Conservatives&apos; coalition partners are opposed to holding a referendum, making it impossible to introduce a proper government parliamentary bill. He denied that the bill was an attempt to alter the outcome of the vote on the backbench amendment, insisting he was &quot;relaxed&quot; about Wednesday&apos;s debate. &quot;It is understandable that Conservative MPs are frustrated that we cannot put legislation forward as a government,&quot; he said. The cabinet minister Ken Clarke, one of the most pro-European Tories, said the party should move on from the issue as a result of Cameron&apos;s move and warned that leaving the EU would be a catastrophe. He told Sky News: &quot;David Cameron has already committed the Conservative party to holding a referendum on Europe in the next parliament; this is obviously an attempt to underline that commitment to a referendum if he gets the chance. &quot;I think we should move on now. The important thing is to make sure we get the right result from any referendum which is held to avoid the catastrophe for the country&apos;s economy and our political standing in the world if we were to be so very, very reckless as to leave the European Union.&quot; But Bernard Jenkin, another senior Tory backbencher, said the only way to draw a line under the issue was a government bill to hold a EU referendum in this parliament. John Redwood told BBC News that Cameron&apos;s decision to publish a draft EU bill did not go far enough. Redwood said he did not doubt Cameron when he said he would hold a referendum in 2017, but he did not want to wait that long. &quot;We, the Conservative party, voted en masse against Nice and Amsterdam and Lisbon, three massively centralising treaties that took powers away from our country. We never agreed to them. We want them sorted out. We do not think Britain can be governed properly under them. And it is urgent.

Likewise, business owners aren&apos;t normally advised to entrust the future direction of their firms to a programme manager. Especially when things are ticking along nicely, thank you. So Kenan Aksular&apos;s brief to radically reappraise Athlon Car Lease International&apos;s business model is an odd one. The Netherlands-based car leasing firm has around 240,000 cars on the road, operates in ten countries and is growing steadily. Not the kind of distressed enterprise in need of a radical shift in strategy, you&apos;d think. Aksular is of a different opinion. For him, the future is all about &apos;mobility&apos;, not about cars. His desire to shake things up is partly a personality thing. The man behind Athlon&apos;s innovation and sustainability programme is a self-confessed &apos;rule breaker&apos;. &quot;I hate it when people say &quot;we&apos;ve done it for the past twenty years, so we still do it.&quot; It&apos;s a common sense thing too though. Athlon leases cars, lots of them. Lots of cars mean lots of carbon emissions, lots of air pollution, lots of traffic jams, and so forth. Fewer cars would, logically speaking, mean fewer such problems. Only that&apos;s not the current direction of travel. Today&apos;s 900m vehicles are set to more than double by 2030. So something has to be done. There&apos;s a business rationale to his shake-up of Athlon&apos;s conventional leasing model too. Intuitively, the opposite seems true. For a car firm like Athlon, fewer cars feels as if it should equate to fewer profits. Not necessarily. New technologies promise new opportunities, Aksular argues. Take the smartphone. Pre-smartphone, car-sharing was something that workmates might do \u2013 although precious few ever did. Now it&apos;s open to everyone and their dogs (nb: check terms and conditions regarding pets). His second business argument centres around percentages. On average, Athlon&apos;s corporate customers lease vehicles for around 20% of their employees. The other 80% are, crudely speaking, left to make their own way by bus, train, bike or, quite possibly, their own car. If Athlon could give these remaining employees &quot;mobility solutions&quot;, as Aksular likes to put it, the company could potentially shift its customer base from 20% to 100% of employees. That&apos;s good for Athlon, but it&apos;s also potentially good for the planet too. Aksular&apos;s ultimate ambition is for people to travel only when it&apos;s absolutely necessary. If they do have to travel, then it&apos;s best not to use a car. If it has to be a car, then best it&apos;s not a gas-guzzler and best it&apos;s as fuel efficient as possible. Athlon is starting with the end scenario first. Aksular believes strongly in the potential of electric vehicles (EVs). His bosses have already invested in more than 1,500 EVs. The company is now participating in the A15 Energy Highway initiative, a \u20ac4.5m cross-sector project that aims to get 3,500 electric vehicles on the streets of the Netherlands by 2015. In addition, Aksular has negotiated a deal with the US-based luxury EV manufacturer Tesla to lease the new Model S in Athlon&apos;s European markets. The high spec EVs, which arrive in Europe this summer, will be available on an eight-year multiple lease deal rather than for the standard four years. Aksular then envisages selling the car&apos;s used battery to energy firms for stationary power storage. He&apos;s also in discussions with California-based Zero Motorcycles about making their battery-powered bikes available to corporate employees that don&apos;t qualify for a lease car. Car-sharing is another business area Aksular is eagerly eying up. Back to the percentages. On average, a leased car is used for less than 2.5 hours per day. For the bulk of the day, it&apos;s sitting in the office car park. Last year, Athlon took a minority share in peer-to-peer Dutch car-sharing firm SnappCar and is now encouraging its corporate lessees to share their car during the day with colleagues \u2013 so-called &quot;B2E&quot;, or Business to Employee. The &quot;ideal situation&quot; would ultimately be to open the sharing scheme to all-comers. &quot;Our stake in SnappCar is not about putting more cars on the roads. It&apos;s about getting more people to use the same base of vehicles,&quot; Aksular explains. Another of Aksular non-leasing ventures is an independent advisory service that focuses on reducing companies&apos; transport-related footprint. Athlon Mobility Consultancy works on everything from introducing corporate bike schemes to developing car-pooling options. &quot;The technology is there. The products are there. But now it&apos;s a matter of helping our customers drive change&quot;, he states. One way of facilitating that is through a mobility card, which enables employees to bundle together taxis, parking, bike hire and other non-leasing mobility services through a single billing system. Aksular acknowledges that his alternative business models will take time to bear fruit in the leasing industry. Yet he believe attitudes are slowly beginning to change, especially among Generation Y&apos;ers. He cites a recent conversation with a large consultancy firm, which had offered a new Mini Cooper to one of its young high flyers. &quot;She said &apos;thank you&apos; out of politeness, but [explained] &apos;actually I live in Amsterdam and I go on my bicycle to work and if it&apos;s raining I go on this tram&apos; &quot;, he recalls. It&apos;s a sign of the future. Even if you want to give young people your new car keys, they might just refuse them.

Lord Ferg&apos;s bags are already packed, Rafa Ben\u00edtez is half-heartedly throwing the contents of his desk into a black bin bag and Bobby Manc has been dumped unceremoniously by Manchester City with nothing more than his selection of scarves and several articulated lorries crammed with severance pay for company. And the general coming and going of managers at the snowy peak of English football is not the only reason the Arsenal manager may feel a little left out. Amid the fond and not-so-fond farewells, and despite a run of six wins and two draws in their past eight games, the story of the Gunners&apos; season has found itself a little lost, relegated to the status of quirky, light-relief subplot in the all-devouring stony-faced Manchester-led Premier League narrative. [At this point the Fiver had planned an elaborate Shakespearean metaphor in which Wenger and his team play the role of donkey-headed Bottoms to Lord Ferg&apos;s Oberon, Bobby Manc&apos;s Lysander and Ben\u00edtez&apos;s cheeky Puck but felt the hideous calling of Pseuds Corner and therefore bottled it]. For the final week of the domestic season, though, Wenger and his team thrust themselves back on to centre stage. Fourth, of course, is the new first \u2013 and it&apos;s eyes down for the bare-knuckle mano-a-mano stripped-to-the-waist slobberknocker between Spurs and Arsenal for the coveted runners-up-to-the-runners-up-to-the-runners-up spot. With Arsenal currently two points behind their north London rivals they must beat the newly-crowned FA Cup holders Wigan at the Emirates this evening in order to keep matters in their own hands on the final day of the season. Anything other than a win for Wigan, on the other hand, will see them drop into what some rather over-dramatically describe as &quot;the abyss&quot; but what the Fiver would rather call &quot;the division just below the Premier League&quot;. &quot;We are on a remarkable run, we have been hugely consistent and we are in a position where our destiny depends on us and we want to finish the job,&quot; said Wenger. &quot;Both teams have to go for it so it is very difficult to know what will happen but usually it should be an open game.&quot; And even though anticipation has a habit of setting you up for disappointment in evening entertainment, as someone once sang, the Latics manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez joined in the general fate-tempting. &quot;It is a game that we have to win but Arsenal have to win so it will be a great advert for the league,&quot; he said. &quot;Two teams with similar ideologies who have to win on the day and I can&apos;t think of a better game to watch.&quot; This could get messy. \u2022 Join Paul Doyle from 7.15pm for MBM coverage of Arsenal 1-0 Wigan.

Terry, who damaged his left ankle in Saturday&apos;s victory at Aston Villa and arrived in the Netherlands with a pronounced limp and with the joint heavily strapped, made a bold attempt to prove he should warrant a place at least on the substitutes&apos; bench by venturing out on to the turf as the squad trained at the Amsterdam ArenA night. But the centre-half, wearing trainers rather than boots, managed only one lap of the pitch with the fitness coach before retiring inside for further treatment. Eden Hazard, who injured a hamstring at Villa Park, will also miss the game, as will Ryan Bertrand. That leaves the interim manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez effectively left to select from a threadbare 18-man squad that includes Victor Moses, who picked up a slight knock at the weekend. Lampard will start and, as Terry&apos;s deputy, will take on the armband against the Portuguese having performed a similar duty in last year&apos;s Champions League showpiece. The veteran is finally expected to sign a new one-year contract to extend his stay at the club into a 13th season in the coming days, with the possibility that confirmation of a deal will be announced ahead of the final game of the domestic season this weekend. Lampard has expressed his pride at his long association with this club, even if the days of being offered longer-term deals are long gone, and offered his sympathies to Terry. The centre-back had missed last season&apos;s Champions League final through suspension, having been red-carded for kicking Barcelona&apos;s Alexis S\u00e1nchez in the semi-final at the Camp Nou, but was permitted to lift the trophy with the midfielder in the post-match ceremony on the pitch. Terry described the Europa League as his &quot;lifeline&quot; last month, having found opportunities limited in domestic competition, and has featured in six of the side&apos;s eight games en route to the final. &quot;It&apos;s very unfortunate,&quot; said Lampard, who hopes to be included in Roy Hodgson&apos;s England squad for next month&apos;s friendlies against the Republic of Ireland and Brazil. &quot;But when we have been here a long time, trying to win cups and leagues, I don&apos;t think it matters too much if you are winning them as an individual or not because you&apos;ve been involved in the process. That would be the same this time if we win. It was the same last year with John and anyone who is suspended or injured: you win it together and, as captain of the club John will be right up there.&quot; Chelsea are seeking to become the first club to follow up Champions League success with a Europa League triumph 12 months later. While their two European finals over the Roman Abramovich era have each culminated in a penalty shoot-out, Lampard revealed the squad had not practised spot-kicks in the buildup to the confrontation with Benfica. &quot;We haven&apos;t as yet,&quot; he said. &quot;We did before etter not. &quot;A year ago we did practise them and did a little circular thing \u2013 I think it was ahead of Swansea [in the Capital One Cup semi-finals], and it&apos;s a strange one. I&apos;ve practised them with England many times at tournaments and we&apos;ve ended up going out. There&apos;s no perfect recipe.&quot; The goalkeeper, Petr Cech, who saved three spot-kicks against Bayern Munich in last year&apos;s final, confirmed he would be willing to take one himself this time round if required.", "sentences": ["Terry, who damaged his left ankle in Saturday&apos;s victory at Aston Villa and arrived in the Netherlands with a pronounced limp and with the joint heavily strapped, made a bold attempt to prove he should warrant a place at least on the substitutes&apos; bench by venturing out on to the turf as the squad trained at the Amsterdam ArenA night."], "title": "Frank Lampard to captain Chelsea against Benfica in Europa League final", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/14/frank-lampard-chelsea-benfica-europa", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Benfica", "Frank Lampard", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-14T22:00:01Z", "article": "It felt almost appropriate that as Petr Cech edged up the aisle on flight ZT7411 to Schiphol, the Boeing 757 should lurch through a pocket of turbulence. So much of the goalkeeper&apos;s time at Chelsea has been jolted by upheaval in the dugout, with eight different managers having come and gone over his nine years with the club. And yet for all the natural talk of trauma, the one constant to mark his time with the London club has been a drip-feed of trophies. If Chelsea win the Europa League Cech will have won every major piece of silverware on offer for a club player in England. The meeting with Benfica will be his 12th final for Chelsea if the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup showpieces are acknowledged as significant. The goalkeeper who turns 31 next week is established at the core of a dwindling group of players involved with the club since the League Cup of 2005 kick-started Roman Abramovich&apos;s revolution. Didier Drogba departed last summer after the Champions League had been won. Frank Lampard and John Terry remain but have grown accustomed to diminished roles. Cech, in contrast, has remained integral whatever the identity of the manager in situ. &quot;The success we&apos;ve had shows everyone is trying to do his best, no matter who the coach is, no matter how the season goes,&quot; he said. &quot;The easiest way to cure the problem has been shock [therapy]: you can&apos;t change 20 players in the middle of the season when things have been going wrong, so it becomes dangerous for the manager if you have a spell where nothing is working. We&apos;ve experienced that a few times and each time, the manager has left. &quot;But each time, you can see the reaction of the team, how we try and improve things. We know we don&apos;t really want to change managers \u2013 that&apos;s absolutely clear \u2013 and it&apos;s so unfortunate when it happens. The ideal situation is the Manchester United scenario where you have the same manager and still win a large number of trophies. But we seem to prove that wrong. &quot;If you see the stability, organisation and the control Arsenal have, it&apos;s amazing, but if you ask their fans about the last eight years, they&apos;d say they&apos;ve not won anything and they don&apos;t like that. We&apos;d have liked to have had more stability, but we always seem to get a trophy. Our fans might say: &apos;Yes, we&apos;d like to see more stability, but we&apos;d rather have the cups.&apos;&quot; What Chelsea retain is a strength of character that has ensured this steady stream of trophies. Cech has been heavily involved in all 10 major honours of the Abramovich era, his own memories of Munich a year ago still vivid. It was the Czech&apos;s penalty saves, from Arjen Robben in extra-time and then Bastian Schweinsteiger and Ivica Olic in the shoot-out, that helped secure the club&apos;s first European Cup, the goalkeeper diving the right way for each of the six spot-kicks he confronted that night. Research paid off, the DVDs scrutinised on the flight over to Germany yielding an insight. It took only 37 minutes to travel from Gatwick to Amsterdam this time around, though the same painstaking preparations are under way &quot;If it comes down to penalties again it will be nerve-racking for everyone, and I&apos;d rather not put the supporters through that, but any way you win a trophy is the right way,&quot; he said. &quot;So far, Munich has been the highlight of my career. It was special because we&apos;d lost in 2008 and sometimes you don&apos;t get a second chance. We got that and grabbed it. &quot;It was just meant to be, an incredible story, but winning back-to-back European trophies would be another great story given we&apos;ve had to change the manager again in the course of the season. I look at this as being the perfect way to finish the season. &quot;It was not easy for [Rafael Ben\u00edtez] with the reception he got, but from day one we were all in the same boat. He came here to improve the situation and help us, and that is what he and the coaching staff have done. We are in a Europa League final and on the edge of qualifying for the Champions League, and that is basically what everyone hoped for when the change came. &quot;Now, whoever comes in will have a really good base to work from. The young players have tasted the Premier League and understand the pressure that comes from playing for Chelsea. We&apos;ll still have players with all the experience and success from the past. The new manager will make some changes, add some players, but he will find a really strong situation here.&quot; And if that new man is, as expected, a returning Jos\u00e9 Mourinho? &quot;With Jos\u00e9 we had great success in the past and I think people still have great admiration and memories for him,&quot; he added. &quot;If he comes back, he will be more than welcome. You always remember a manager who gave you a chance to play and you had success with and the club had success with. They are the moments: the joy of working together and winning together always stays with you.&quot;", "sentences": ["It took only 37 minutes to travel from Gatwick to Amsterdam this time around, though the same painstaking preparations are under way &quot;If it comes down to penalties again it will be nerve-racking for everyone, and I&apos;d rather not put the supporters through that, but any way you win a trophy is the right way,&quot; he said."], "title": "Petr Cech's Chelsea journey low on stability but heavy on silverware", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/14/petr-cech-chelsea-europa-league", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Football", "Europa League", "Benfica", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-14T22:00:04Z", "article": "The glossy brochure handed out at the door of the Amsterdam ArenA bore the same slogan that has been emblazoned across some of the more prominent bridges on the city&apos;s canal ring. &quot;Discover The Excitement&quot; is the message Uefa is trying to push for the Europa League and for Chelsea that certainly beats the old &quot;Thursday night, Channel 5&quot; mantra that accompanied their appearances in earlier rounds of this competition. The Europa League might seem like a downgrade on the trophy they won in Munich a year ago but it does represents a chance to end a chaotic season on a high and, even if it is only for 10 days, there is the opportunity to become the first team to hold both of Uefa&apos;s biggest club prizes simultaneously. The alternative is barely worth thinking about after the various ordeals Chelsea have experienced in the Champions League, the Club World Cup, the Super Cup, the Premier League, the FA Cup, the Capital One Cup and the Community Shield. To lose against Benfica would leave Chelsea the subject of a pub-quiz question: name the only English side to play in eight different competitions in a single season and win none? It has been a turbulent season, to say the least, but Frank Lampard was right when he said it would be defined by what happens in this final rather than the upheaval that preceded it. &quot;We&apos;re all used to things happening at this club in the middle of the season,&quot; he said. &quot;What&apos;s important is what happens at the end of it. We want to win it so we can say we&apos;ve won it, as simple as that.&quot; And, he might have added, there will be no asterisk in the record books to indicate it loses value on the basis many Chelsea fans cannot bring themselves to like the man picking the team. Rafael Ben\u00edtez certainly did not appreciate being asked whether he should have apologised to the club&apos;s supporters after the comments \u2013 some genuine, others exaggerated and some totally fictitious \u2013 that were attached to him when he was Liverpool manager. &quot;Why?&quot; he shot back. &quot;For what?&quot; He could have gone further, but resisted the temptation. One of Ben\u00edtez&apos;s qualities this season has been his ability to block out the bad feeling, at least for the most part, and fully focus on the matches. His attention was more with the fact he will have to do without Eden Hazard after the expected confirmation that the Belgian&apos;s hamstring injury will keep him out. John Terry, nursing a sprained ankle, would probably not have started anyway, but Hazard&apos;s absence represents a considerable setback. &quot;To lose a player for a final is always bad, no matter who it is, but it&apos;s obvious in this case,&quot; Ben\u00edtez said. &quot;Hazard was playing well and he can make the difference in games.&quot; Benfica certainly represent difficult opponents, as Newcastle can testify to from the quarter-finals. What state of mind they will be in is another matter after losing to Porto last weekend and potentially surrendering the Portuguese championship. Yet Jorge Jesus has assembled a quick-moving team with great mobility and passing qualities. They have a striker, \u00d3scar Cardozo, who has 31 goals this season and Nemanja Matic is a far more distinguished player now than in his short stint at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea, however, can be encouraged by the fact that when the two sides met in the Champions League last season they won 1-0 at Est\u00e1dio da Luz followed by a 2-1 victory at Stamford Bridge. Yet they will also remember how close it was to going horribly wrong. Benfica were on top in the second leg for long spells and even with 10 men they created something close to panic when they made it 1-1 with a Javi Garc\u00eda goal after 85 minutes. They had chances to score a second and decisive away goal before Raul Meireles soothed Chelsea&apos;s nerves with a late winner. There is also the fact that this will be Chelsea&apos;s 68th game of a long, demanding season whereas their opponents have played only 49. &quot;For six months we have been playing two games, at least, a week,&quot; Ben\u00edtez said. &quot;Imagine any club in the world having to do that. It would be difficult for anyone to progress. Sixty-eight games.&quot; He makes the point because it reinforces his view that &quot;it was not an easy situation&quot; joining a club where the supporters did not want him, but that they had &quot;managed well \u2013 and I think people realise that now&quot;. Ideally, he said, he would like to stay in England. &quot;If not, I will go abroad \u2026 maybe a top side with money, where you can buy players and challenge for trophies.&quot; One certainty is that it will help if he can win his third European trophy in nine years.", "sentences": ["The glossy brochure handed out at the door of the Amsterdam ArenA bore the same slogan that has been emblazoned across some of the more prominent bridges on the city&apos;s canal ring."], "title": "Never mind the middle, let's look to happy ending, says Frank Lampard | Daniel Taylor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/14/chelsea-benfica-europa-league", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Benfica", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-15T13:21:26Z", "article": "A huge inflatable duck that has been floating in Hong Kong&apos;s Victoria harbour for the past two weeks has been unexpectedly reduced to a puddle of yellow plastic, drawing howls of protest \u2013 and accusations of &apos;fowl play&apos;.

His severed head now perches on a tree branch. Beside it hangs his headless, armless body and, further along the branch, the missing arms. Two other naked, mutilated bodies also slump around the tree. This is not a video from Syria such as the one currently causing worldwide shock. Horrific images in this video reveal a rebel commander called Khaled al-Hamad appearing to eat the heart of one of his enemies. He cuts it out of the body on camera while uttering insults to the Alawite religious minority to which President Assad belongs: the rebel has confirmed it is him and this is what he did. He says he also has a video of himself dismembering an enemy with a saw. Time magazine says he ate a lung, rather than the man&apos;s heart. The picture I started with, however, was drawn by Francisco de Goya in the early 19th century and it depicts the horrors of the Spanish peninsular war of 1808-1814. It is called Great Deeds Against the Dead. Khaled al-Hamad&apos;s acts on video might easily be given the same title. Do we really believe that soldiers or rebels or even civilians who come across a slain enemy always treat the fallen with respect? Or that the living fare much better at the heart of war?     Francisco de Goya's Great Deeds Against the Dead. Photograph: Alamy    Images such as this gruesome, vengeful feasting on an enemy&apos;s flesh make news today because, in spite of the immediacy of modern media, we generally see a far more sanitised picture of war than people did in the age of Goya, or earlier. Strangely enough, the depiction of war in today&apos;s newspapers and television is far more sentimental than it was in the past. In his lost masterpiece The Battle of Anghiari, Leonardo da Vinci reduces war to a savagery very like what this video shows. A copy of a central part of the painting by Rubens shows one soldier about to hack off another&apos;s hand, their horses biting each other, and the mens&apos; faces as masks of hate. Da Vinci wrote that a depiction of a battle should include desperate characters who &quot;take revenge with nails and teeth&quot;. Many paintings of battles, although they show the pageantry of war, also reveal the barbarism it unleashes. The dead are crushed under horses, the wounded struggle in mud and blood. Extreme violence is recorded in paintings when today it would be left veiled by the news media. A 17th-century painting that hangs in Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum shows the mutilated bodies of the De Witt brothers hanging upside down after they were accused of treason. Such works of art come from an age when it was taken for granted that wars, riots and political murders were deliberately cruel releases of the worst human beings are capable of. A war atrocity is shown, non-judgmentally, in the Bayeux tapestry. A crushed enemy lies under a chariot in one of the oldest images of war, the so-called Standard of Ur. Why, then, is the video from Syria considered so troubling? It is vile of course, but that is because war is vile. Good soldiers know that. &quot;You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will,&quot; the American civil war general William Tecumseh Sherman told the people of Atlanta before burning their city to hasten the defeat of the slaveholding south. &quot;War is cruelty and you cannot refine it.&quot; It is a mystery why we are more hypocritical about war&apos;s true nature than Sherman or Goya were. Is it because the modern west has not seen major conflict on its own soil since 1945 and so can afford to tell itself pretty lies? Or is it because democratic nation states need to soften the images of conflict in order to win popular support for it? It is only the bad guys who are brutal, we like to think. Whatever the reasons, there is no excuse for taking this video of a brutal wartime act as some kind of reason for refusing to support Syria&apos;s rebels. The truth is, every war and every army is capable of great deeds against the dead and monstrous ones against the living. In Crete in 1941, fleeing Germans were deliberately run over by British tanks. That was not a war crime. It was war. This video is not a reason to change our minds about Syria&apos;s rebels. It is a reason to stop kidding ourselves about what war is.", "sentences": ["A 17th-century painting that hangs in Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum shows the mutilated bodies of the De Witt brothers hanging upside down after they were accused of treason."], "title": "The horror of the Syrian video is the horror of war | Jonathan Jones", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/15/syrian-video-war-khaled-al-hamad", "tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Francisco de Goya", "Art and design", "War crimes", "Law"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-15T15:42:46Z", "article": "IN DEFENCE OF POJT The Fiver doesn&apos;t usually have any problems when it comes to shooting fish in a barrel.

We could do all that (and we want to. Oh, how we want to) but on this occasion our trigger finger paused even as the great guppy-faced yawping fish-mouth hoved into view.

FIVER LETTERS &quot;Regarding Stephen Aziz&apos;s Quote of the Day from yesterday&apos;s Fiver, it is slightly ironic that someone who is employed to ensure a group of men look as immaculately turned out as possible can criticise the vanity of a former colleague&quot; \u2013 Tom Hooper. &quot;Is Stephen Aziz&apos;s entertaining rant the first example of a kit man airing a former club&apos;s dirty laundry in public? No doubt Mancini&apos;s riposte will be to point out the lack of clean sheets at Sunderland since last summer&quot; \u2013 Justin Kavanagh. &quot;Does Roberto Mart\u00ednez really think that the conflict between Wigan and Arsenal featured &apos;two teams with similar ideologies?&apos; (yesterday&apos;s Fiver). This seems a high level of analysis, even given Mart\u00ednez and Wenger&apos;s reputations as the biggest brains in English football. Other historic conflicts between &apos;two teams with similar ideologies&apos; don&apos;t always end well. Henry Kissinger said that the difference between Zhou En-Lai and Mao was that &apos;Mao thought of himself as a philosopher; Zhou saw his role as an administrator or a negotiator&apos;. Certainly Wenger fits the self-imagined philosopher role (with a cult of personality to boot), but not sure Mart\u00ednez fancies himself a mere administrator. And then there&apos;s always the struggle between the two ancient St Petersburg Bolshevik teams, with rival managers Lenin and Trotsky, &apos;two teams with similar ideologies&apos;.

Hodgson will ask Cole as a &quot;special gesture&quot; if he wants to stand in for the injured Steven Gerrard for the friendly against Republic of Ireland on 29 May, to mark the fact he is now a member of the 100 Club as the seventh player to win a century of England caps. The England manager will then consider giving Rooney the captaincy for the game in Brazil four days later, having been assured by the Manchester United striker that his attempt to leave the club will not affect his international performances. Gary Neville, one of Hodgson&apos;s coaches, has already expressed his own concerns that Rooney has &quot;not been himself over these last couple of months and you can see something is wrong&quot;. Hodgson, however, is confident Rooney&apos;s England form will not suffer while his future is in doubt. &quot;I&apos;m not concerned about him,&quot; Hodgson, speaking before the Europa League final in Amsterdam, said. &quot;I&apos;ve spoken to him. I was concerned because his wife is having a baby not long before we meet up. But he was at great pains to assure me that he was really looking forward to playing for England, that it&apos;s top of his agenda, and that&apos;s enough for me. I&apos;ve no reason to doubt that and no reason to doubt him. &quot;There are rumours circulating about whether he wants a move and whether Manchester United are prepared to sell him. These are all things that only Manchester United and Wayne Rooney know, quite frankly. As far as I&apos;m concerned, it&apos;s what he does for England that counts and how he&apos;s going to perform in these next two matches and then the matches in the autumn.&quot; Hodgson intends to name a 22-man squad and has not been tempted to invite John Terry back despite Rio Ferdinand officially retiring from international duty. Ferdinand rang Hodgson to explain his decision but would not have been included anyway when the squad is announced on Thursday. Terry, it has emerged, has also telephoned Hodgson to apologise for the flurry of recent publicity about him wanting to come out of international retirement. Hodgson is aware that it was the Chelsea player himself who had privately let the story be known and it also transpired the former England captain has regularly been sending him good-luck text messages before games. Hodgson&apos;s conclusion is that Terry is &quot;still very much in retirement&quot;. He added: &quot;If push came to shove and we were desperate maybe we would turn to them [Terry and Ferdinand] again. But\u00a0\u2013 and it&apos;s a big but \u2013 it&apos;s time to move forward. It&apos;s time for me to get behind the players who are there.&quot; Hodgson&apos;s interest in Routledge stems from Ashley Young&apos;s absence through injury while Leon Britton, another Swansea City player, has been under consideration at a time when Gerrard is missing and Jack Wilshere is preparing for surgery on his troublesome ankle. Carroll has not played for England since a substitute&apos;s appearance in the World Cup qualifier against San Marino in October but will make the cut on the back of his improved form for West Ham United over the past six weeks. Hodgson, who named the Aston Villa duo Matthew Lowton and Ashley Westwood as players who had caught his eye, explained his reasons for wanting Cole to captain the team against Ireland. &quot;It would be a special gesture. He&apos;s receiving his cap at Wembley and it&apos;s something for us to think about.&quot; Rooney, he added, &quot;knows he is right up there&quot; as a possible captain against Brazil. Hodgson&apos;s plans are not made easier by Chelsea and Manchester City embarking on end-of-season trips to the US, meaning their players will not fly back until the day the England squad report for duty. Tottenham also have a trip planned to the Caribbean and Hodgson is frustrated that it impinges on his own plans.

Chelsea&apos;s campaign has taken in 68 matches in 11 different countries across eight competitions, an energy-sapping schedule overseen by two managers that, courtesy of a stoppage-time winner near its end, has yielded silverware. Rafael Ben\u00edtez paced his technical area here, hands sunk deep into his pockets, as this contest played out its frantic last seconds before the final whistle brought relief. His punch of the air was stifled by Christophe Lollichon&apos;s bear-hug. Once he had emerged from the goalkeeping coach&apos;s embrace, there was a smile of satisfaction plastered across his face. Some measure of the calm professionalism that has typified much of his seven months at Stamford Bridge, one acrimonious evening on Teesside aside, swiftly returned as he busied himself consoling distraught Benfica players. Ben\u00edtez actually had to be coaxed from his thoughts, as he surveyed his team&apos;s guard of honour, to lead the victors up the steps to accept the trophy in the cluttered presentation box. There were even congratulations from some Chelsea fans as he made that plod up the stairs, and further hugs of gratitude from Michael Emenalo, Ron Gourlay, Dave Barnard and Bruce Buck before he sidled off stage right. He has had to wait some time to receive public thanks for his endeavours at this club. &quot;It has not been easy,&quot; he said, &quot;so I am really pleased, really proud.&quot; Proper acceptance at Chelsea was always going to elude the Spaniard, for all the giddy scenes in the aftermath. Theirs has been a fraught marriage of convenience, born of the team&apos;s mid-season lull in form and an out-of-work manager&apos;s desire to reestablish his credentials away from mere blogs and coaching seminars. He will depart this club in a few weeks&apos; time, once his side have conducted a two-match post-season tour of the United States, with his reputation enhanced within the game. The Europa League has partly helped achieve that. A top-four finish is arguably even more impressive. But his quiet dignity in an awkward and, from the start, distinctly fractious situation has been admirable. He deserved his chance to hoist the trophy in the aftermath, though the look on his face as he did so betrayed a man who felt he was intruding on someone else&apos;s party. A penny for his thoughts as he held the Europa League aloft and those in the Chelsea end chorused in celebration as they waved their plastic blue flags. Once Sunday&apos;s visit of Everton concludes an English club&apos;s most cluttered campaign since Arsenal played 70 times in 1979-80, Ben\u00edtez, will look back with some satisfaction at all he has achieved here. This had been an exercise in short-term firefighting, a lesson in pragmatic survival amid that draining schedule. Coaching the European champions was not supposed to be a difficult proposition but this was a club with its own particular problems when he succeeded Roberto Di Matteo in the autumn. Chelsea were third at the time, and only four points from the top, but the team&apos;s trajectory was clear. They had shipped 21 goals in nine matches, had failed to win in four league games, and the manager who had claimed the Champions League six months earlier was showing no signs of restoring on-field discipline. The Spaniard has pointed, with some justification, to the imbalanced squad he inherited with Chelsea having overloaded on creative midfielders, all mouth-watering talents but each set upon scuttling runs upfield with little regard for the acres they left unguarded at the back. They boasted only Fernando Torres up front, a player whose form had been flimsy at best. It is to the interim&apos;s credit that the Spaniard&apos;s fine goal in the Amsterdam ArenA \u2013 the strength and pace of old to flummox Luis\u00e3o and convert calmly beyond Artur \u2013 was his ninth in Europe this term, and only Cristiano Ronaldo and Robert Lewandowski boast more. The Spaniard is a reigning World Cup, European Championship, European Cup and Europa League winner which, in itself, is remarkable. Ben\u00edtez had still wanted to add more than just Demba Ba to the ranks in January, with his pleas for a mobile central midfielder falling on deaf ears. Benfica exposed his side&apos;s limitations with their fluid, attacking movement, with Nicol\u00e1s Gait\u00e1n, Enzo P\u00e9rez and Eduardo Salvio gliding beyond blue-shirted markers far too easily. Chelsea can labour in central midfield when the ball buzzes around them at pace, and at the back when slippery opponents strike an upbeat rhythm. Yet this group retains its stubborn streak, that old refusal to wilt. They clung to the contest, just as they had against Bayern Munich a year ago, and prevailed at the last. A team who has played this many games this term has no right to conjure a 93rd-minute winner when they have been chasing the ball for long periods. His insistence on juggling his squad, sometimes amid a clamour of criticism, has helped meet his principal objectives. Retaining a level of freshness and zest represented a colossal challenge and, despite the near-misses in domestic cup competitions and the Fifa Club World Cup, he can now point to a significant trophy and Champions League qualification as evidence of proper success. As his players celebrated raucously on the turf, the blue confetti still drifting around the arena, Ben\u00edtez held the trophy up to the support once more and was greeted, perhaps for the first time in his short association with the club, with cheers. &quot;I could see everyone was happy,&quot; he said. &quot;So I was happy too.&quot; This relationship will end well.", "sentences": ["It is to the interim&apos;s credit that the Spaniard&apos;s fine goal in the Amsterdam ArenA \u2013 the strength and pace of old to flummox Luis\u00e3o and convert calmly beyond Artur \u2013 was his ninth in Europe this term, and only Cristiano Ronaldo and Robert Lewandowski boast more."], "title": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez vindicated after methods finally earn Chelsea acceptance | Dominic Fifield", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/16/rafael-benitez-chelsea-europa-league", "tags": ["Rafael Ben\u00edtez", "Chelsea", "Football", "Sport", "Europa League", "Benfica", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-16T10:48:24Z", "article": "A mother&apos;s attempt to ban Anne Frank&apos;s diary from classrooms in Michigan over &quot;pornographic&quot; anatomical descriptions has failed, after a committee ruled that the title&apos;s removal &quot;would effectively impose situational censorship&quot;. Earlier this month the mother of a 12-year-old in the Northville school district in Michigan raised concerns with the school about her daughter reading the &quot;definitive&quot; version of Frank&apos;s The Diary of a Young Girl, in which Frank writes how &quot;until I was 11 or 12, I didn&apos;t realise there was a second set of labia on the inside, since you couldn&apos;t see them. What&apos;s even funnier is that I thought urine came out of the clitoris&quot;, and &quot;when you&apos;re standing up, all you see from the front is hair. Between your legs there are two soft, cushiony things, also covered with hair, which press together when you&apos;re standing, so you can&apos;t see what&apos;s inside. They separate when you sit down and they&apos;re very red and quite fleshy on the inside. In the upper part, between the outer labia, there&apos;s a fold of skin that, on second thought, looks like a kind of blister. That&apos;s the clitoris.&quot; The definitive edition of the diary contains material deleted from the 1947 version by Otto Frank, Anne&apos;s father. Buddy Elias, her cousin, has said that it shows Anne &quot;in a truer light, not as a saint, but as a girl like every other girl. She was nothing, actually; people try to make a saint out of her and glorify her. That she was not. She was an ordinary, normal girl with a talent for writing.&quot; But the Michigan mother told press that the unexpurgated version was &quot;pretty graphic, and it&apos;s pretty pornographic for seventh-grade boys and girls to be reading&quot;, adding &quot;it&apos;s inappropriate for a teacher to be giving this material out to the kids when it&apos;s really the parents&apos; job to give the students this information.&quot; She launched a formal complaint asking for the diary to be removed from the school \u2013 a move which was vehemently protested by free speech campaigners, who said that The Diary of a Young Girl was &quot;both relevant to today&apos;s students and pedagogically valuable&quot;, and that &quot;the passage in question relates to an experience that may be of particular concern to many \u2026 students: physical changes associated with puberty.&quot; The school committee has now voted unanimously to retain the book as an option for students in the seventh grade curriculum after reviewing the mother&apos;s concerns. &quot;The committee felt strongly that a decision to remove the use of Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl \u2013 The Definitive Edition as a choice within this larger unit of study would effectively impose situational censorship by eliminating the opportunity for the deeper study afforded by this edition,&quot; wrote assistant superintendent Robert Behnke in a letter to the community. The Diary of a Young Girl charts Frank&apos;s life as a Jewish teenager in hiding during the second world war. It is widely viewed as a classic, and has sold millions of copies in countries around the world.

You&apos;re stuck at the office, fairly bored and looking at a sports website to while away the few remaining hours of the working day. The man who managed your football team was sacked in the early hours of the morning and you are waiting to discover who will replace him. The news breaks and your worst fears are confirmed. The team&apos;s owner has appointed a man who once led your rivals and passed a few unwelcome remarks about your club and its fans. You have a couple of options. You could give him a chance; his track record is solid, he has won the most prestigious trophy in club football and he will only be in the job for a few months. Or you could raid the stationery department, scrawl the words &quot;Ben\u00edtez out&quot; on to a banner and make your way down to the club&apos;s training ground. Obviously anyone who takes the second approach is one of society&apos;s outliers and should not be taken too seriously in a discussion about fandom. But the fact that a grown man would consider such bizarre behaviour \u2013 and that the rest of us are so unsurprised \u2013 shows how angry football fans have become. Imagine for a second how you would feel if someone turned up outside your new workplace to petition against your appointment. This banner-wielding supporter is a fanatic in the most ugly sense of the word: a man incapable of appropriating his precious time on this earth. But he is only an extreme version of many of his contemporaries. A substantial portion of Chelsea fans stood against the appointment of Rafa Ben\u00edtez. They unfurled banners, booed his name, chanted &quot;Fuck off Ben\u00edtez, you&apos;re not wanted here&quot;, and held aloft pathetic A4 sheets of paper that were meant to intimidate the new boss \u2013 all because Ben\u00edtez had the temerity to criticise them years before while managing another club. In some senses you have to admire the splenetic loyalty of these fans. Their tribalism is so intense and their hearts are so hardened that they would not review their opinions of Ben\u00edtez or give him a chance. But as the season has progressed, they have come to look increasingly ridiculous. The man they jeered so fervently has provided them with a trophy-winning team. Ben\u00edtez became only the fourth Chelsea manager to win a European trophy last night after Dave Sexton (1971 Cup Winners&apos; Cup), Gianluca Vialli (1998 Cup Winners&apos; Cup) and Roberto Di Matteo (2012 Champions League). In other circumstances, he would be heralded as a club legend but, as Chelsea&apos;s fans and players celebrated winning the Europa League in the Amsterdam Arena, Benitez cut a forlorn figure, like a man alone with everyone. &quot;It has not been easy,&quot; he said on Wednesday night, &quot;so I am really pleased, really proud.&quot; And so he should be. Winning the Europa League in a temporary job is incomparable to winning the Champions League with a squad he built and honed, but Chelsea&apos;s victory was perhaps the most personal achievement of his career. He had to work alone and to the soundtrack of taunts from his own fans. As Ben\u00edtez leaves Chelsea with his third European trophy in 10 years, he deserves credit and thanks from fans. It&apos;s probably too late for them to douse him with great praise, but does his success show that supporters should learn to withhold their judgment in future?", "sentences": ["In other circumstances, he would be heralded as a club legend but, as Chelsea&apos;s fans and players celebrated winning the Europa League in the Amsterdam Arena, Benitez cut a forlorn figure, like a man alone with everyone."], "title": "Are football supporters too harsh on managers and players?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/16/football-fans-harsh-managers-players-benitez", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Football", "Sport", "Europa League", "Benfica", "Europa League 2012-13"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-16T22:00:02Z", "article": "Frank Lampard believes Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s anticipated reappointment as manager this summer will restore Chelsea as a &quot;consistent force&quot; and enable the club to challenge for the Premier League title next season. The England midfielder captained the team to Europa League success against Benfica in Amsterdam on Wednesday and followed that by signing a one-year contract. Lampard, who turns 35 next month, admitted there was a period at the turn of the year when he feared his 12-year association with the club was to be severed but he has agreed a contract believed to be worth in the region of \u00a3120,000 a week. Chelsea hope to announce the identity of their manager in mid-June with talks continuing with Real Madrid to secure Mourinho&apos;s release from his contract as all parties seek a change. The Portuguese&apos;s probable return apparently played no part in Lampard&apos;s contract negotiations though, sensing his former mentor&apos;s imminent restoration to the dug-out, the midfielder believes the side can recover some of the relentless consistency of old and compete for a first league title since 2010. &quot;If Jos\u00e9 comes back it will be a huge lift for the club,&quot; said Lampard, who was attending an Adidas event at Stamford Bridge to celebrate his club record of 203 goals. &quot;It&apos;s no secret he&apos;s an idol for the fans. He&apos;s the greatest manager in our history and he changed the whole belief of the club and made us into a winning club. &quot;It will lift the fans, and I know it will lift the players. Those who haven&apos;t worked with him before will understand he&apos;ll come in and give them an extra edge. Hopefully that will take us back to being that consistent force. &quot;We&apos;ve got a great squad and can do better than we did at times this season. I&apos;m talking about consistency, in the Premier League, which has not been good enough in the last two years. We have to address that, and it gets harder every year. Manchester United and Manchester City have raised the bar but we are all in a different situation this year with the various changes of manager. &quot;We concentrate on ourselves and I believe we have the strength in our squad to do it. But we need to get back to that battering ram, winning mentality we had before, winning games 1-0 even when we weren&apos;t at our best. &quot;It&apos;s a bit like a magic recipe and a lot of mental work goes into that. You have to be able to grind out results, having that togetherness and structure in the team. Everyone has bad periods in games or seasons but that&apos;s when you close ranks. Too many times over the last few years we&apos;ve had a bad month which has seen us drop down. That&apos;s what we need to put right. &quot;Under Jos\u00e9 we were criticised for being so dogged, but we need to get back to a bit of that. It doesn&apos;t mean taking away the beautiful football but you need a balance. It&apos;s a huge priority to be challenging for the title next season, as well as to get through the Champions League group stage. It&apos;ll be a big task but it&apos;ll be our main one.&quot; The new manager will be offered clout to compete in the transfer market and bolster a squad who will end up playing 69 games this season and, if Everton are beaten on Sunday in the final round of fixtures, will add a third-place finish in the Premier League to their success in the Europa League. The interim manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez, who is under contract until the end of June and will oversee next week&apos;s tour of the United States, has indicated he expects the club to spend \u20ac100m (\u00a385m) on new recruits. &quot;They will sign three or four players,&quot; he said. &quot;The foundation is already there. The future is bright for them.&quot; The Bayer Leverkusen forward Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle is expected to complete a \u00a320m move to Chelsea next month, with interest also retained in Everton&apos;s Marouane Fellaini and the Corinthians midfielder Paulinho. Another striker will be added to the ranks and, while Radamel Falcao is close to joining Monaco from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Chelsea will compete for Napoli&apos;s Edinson Cavani and Borussia Dortmund&apos;s Robert Lewandowski, despite the latter&apos;s likely move to Bayern Munich.Lampard, who is a candidate to captain England against the Republic of Ireland later this month and has 17 goals this season, hopes to play his own part in that strengthened side next term having expressed relief at securing his future for a further season. The midfielder had spoken with Chelsea&apos;s technical director, Michael Emenalo, at the Club World Cup in Japan last December to seek clarification and, when it was suggested no offer was on the table, considered his options with tentative interest expressed by such as Arsenal and Manchester United, and most persuasively by Los Angeles Galaxy. &quot;There was a time when I thought I might have to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d been injured through November and the club were looking to move forward. I understand that. It was up to me to get my head down and show I wanted to stay. But leaving was certainly a consideration at that time. &quot;There were a few different things and I had to make sure what was right for me because there were several other routes I could&apos;ve gone down, and I had to look at them. But everyone knows my first choice was to stay. When you look at the big picture, who wouldn&apos;t want to stay here? I&apos;m excited to be part of the future.&quot; Frank Lampard appeared at a 3D installation commissioned by Adidas to showcase his 203 club goal record.

Chelsea&apos;s victorious players, the majority suited and booted but all with winners&apos; medals draped around their necks, piled on to Titan Airways flight ZT7412 from Schiphol and rather slumped into their seats, basking in the afterglow of success. Petr Cech raised a plastic thimble of a glass of Champagne. Frank Lampard and John Terry, just inside the door, each enjoyed a bottle of beer. All sported weary smiles as the hefty Europa League trophy was passed, row by row, down the plane. The contrast with Munich last May was stark, not least with the players travelling back immediately after their late win at the Amsterdam ArenA with a final league game still ahead, rather than enjoying an overnight celebration at their hotel before the victorious trip home. The mood reflected many things: relief that a slog of a season had finally yielded silverware; satisfaction at a second successive European title; fatigue as a campaign that has stretched to 68 fixtures is nearing a conclusion. It was as if the initial flurry of riotous celebration in the dressing room immediately after Branislav Ivanovic&apos;s stoppage-time winner had drained the last drops of emotion from a squad that, emotionally and physically, are on their last legs.

For Lamps, it was a really good moment, one he deserves. For Branislav, too. He has the personality of a leader, and his header showed that.&quot; The Serb, denied involvement in last season&apos;s Champions League showpiece due to suspension, had managed to miss the celebrations this time as he conducted 13 separate interviews with various media outlets, the weighty Uefa man-of-the-match award he had claimed never far from his side. By the time he returned to the dressing room his team-mates were changed, the floor littered with strapping and spent bottles of energy drinks, and readying to depart for the airport. &quot;I was too late to join in,&quot; he said, albeit without any real hint of bitterness. &quot;My phone battery had gone, too, so I haven&apos;t even received any messages of congratulations.&quot; His BlackBerry must surely have trilled with recognition on Thursday. &quot;There was a lot of satisfaction in that dressing room,&quot; said Lampard. &quot;Munich was special \u2013 it was the pinnacle. Amsterdam was always going to be different, but there was still a real sense of achievement. It had been a tough, long season and there was a real desire to win in those circumstances. We were very content afterwards. There was no Didier Drogba to deliver a speech [as he had last year], and we knew we had the game on Sunday as well, so there wasn&apos;t over-celebration. But it was important we won something. You are defined by that. We all are. It&apos;s something to put on our CV. If we&apos;d walked away having lost it would have been a horrible feeling, so it was a huge game to win.&quot; Rafael Ben\u00edtez, if perhaps only privately, would echo such sentiment. The interim first-team manager has endured much over his tumultuous seven-month spell at this club but, if only in the last throes of his tenure, a grudging respect for his methods has developed among those in the stands who so loathed him from the outset. He will still never be loved but history may end up recalling his brief period in charge, which will fizzle out after next week&apos;s post-season tour of the US, more fondly. The overriding memory may not be livid mutiny at his mere presence, but of progress and reward. &quot;I don&apos;t think anyone expected the way it was at the start, but I don&apos;t think it affected him,&quot; said the assistant manager, Bolo Zenden, of the ferocious reception afforded the Spaniard back in November. &quot;We knew gradually it would be a bit better. The whole thing has been a crazy ride. The target was to finish top four and make sure of Champions League football, and we&apos;ve secured that. But to reach a final and finish like this is super. We&apos;ve had games every three days, with a squad that wasn&apos;t the biggest. &quot;We had all 25 of our players in Holland, and only 18 were available, so it says a lot that we managed to keep them fit up until that last game at Aston Villa. It&apos;s been hectic, busy and the last time we had four days between games it just felt weird. It was, like: &apos;What&apos;s going on, we&apos;re having a mini-holiday?&apos; But it&apos;s been a great ride.&quot; It says much that Chelsea mustered a late winner in their penultimate game of the season despite not making a substitution in Amsterdam. It is the first time in 21 years that a finalist in a major European showpiece has not introduced a player from the bench, but Ben\u00edtez&apos;s options had been limited. They merited their sense of achievement, the outpouring of elation that had greeted the final whistle shared with a delirious support. The victors had been joined by an interloper on the pitch, 11-year-old Louis Kearns from Liverpool infiltrating the celebrations and even climbing the steps with Chelsea&apos;s players to shake hands with the Uefa president, Michel Platini.

Beckham will be genuinely missed, in part for his unstinting commitment, relentlessly hobbling about the pitch like a faithful bandy-legged horse. But mainly for that single super power, the right foot that seemed to have its own distinct and separate mini-brain, a whirring starship enterprise bridge located somewhere above the big toe and crammed with scampering minions, constantly firing up the phasers, setting course at warp speed three, and reeling off the long-distance side-foot, the crossfield skim, the top-corner yawn, hallmarked in each case with the fussiness of a genuine craftsman. At a time of wider departures it makes you wonder a little also about those who remain behind. In particular John Terry, one of the few enduring fixtures of what feels like a domestic era that has now passed, and who again emerged this week from the wings to lift a major European trophy. There was a lot of talk about Terry&apos;s latest fancy-dress intrusion in Amsterdam, the quick-change emergence from the stands in pristine matchday kit that was, in truth, entirely harmless and even quite sweet, like the kind of boy who insists on wearing his Spider-Man suit to a wedding. For many the wider assumption here was that this simply exposed what are perceived to be Terry&apos;s worst traits: yahooing self-promotion, mendaciousness, leaving the washing-up and all the rest of it. In fact the opposite is true. No matter what your opinion of Terry, those full-kit gatecrash celebrations actually show him at his best, providing a little glimpse into his own private magic dust, those rather opaque footballing qualities that have provided the enduring ballast to a career that might otherwise have been scuttled many times. This is not to defend Terry on wider issues. It was above all the failure simply to own up and apologise that makes the Anton Ferdinand incident doubly wretched. Although, it must be said that even pre-racism controversy Terry had become something of a repository in English football for all that is bad, a convenient touchstone for absolute awfulness, like Piers Morgan or tonsillitis, not to mention other often unvoiced feelings of wider anxiety. You get the feeling, and the details aren&apos;t yet clear, that he is somehow responsible for Ukip, for disaffected inner city youth, for the failings of the high-speed rail system. There is a kind of contagion here. If you stand near him in a lift you&apos;re 50% more likely to walk out of it a benefit cheat. If you think about him too much, or voice favourable opinions on, say, his tackling, you will start to forget how to do basic maths, or find yourself drunkenly chucking chips around at the bus shelter or riding a very small bike defiantly along the centre of a crowded shopping street. In spite of which there remains something oddly vital about Terry&apos;s presence. To the extent that to dismiss him entirely because of those parts of him you may find dislikable is also to miss something of substance. First, though, it is necessary to consider the unique environment at Chelsea, a club that has been subjected to the irradiating effects of billionaire ownership for almost a decade. And also to acknowledge the basic inanity of the billionaire himself, a creature whose existence is essentially the complete opposite of sport, with all its ragged edges and imperfections. Whereas the billionaire lifestyle is pegged out around a notion of absolute certainties, a sense of being continually replete, recumbent on a giant mattress made of veal, helicoptered from triple-glazed pyramid to glass-walled enormo-drome. To the billionaire, sport, with all its glorious uncertainty, is something to be tamed and killed, machine-gunned with money, until even the grandest football club begins to resemble some stretched and burnished trophy wife, muzzled beneath a paste of high-end slap and stitch. At which point it is tempting to compare the performances of Manchester City and Chelsea in their respective end-of-era cup finals. City of course were flat in defeat by Wigan, a team of declining celebrity electricity now in need of their routine two-yearly defibrilation. No doubt City will rise again, but compare this sense of Gatsby\u2011ish ennui with Chelsea&apos;s air of purpose against a Benfica team that had them hanging on in the first half. There is still an extraordinary internal momentum to the Chelsea project. It just keeps on driving forward: 11 trophies and counting in the years since The Event. Led by a stick-on manager, surrounded by departures and uncertainties, Chelsea just looked incredibly happy in Amsterdam. And Terry, of course, is a significant constant in all this. This is his quality: not speed, athleticism or technical skills. During Fabio Capello&apos;s spell as England manager one of his assistants was asked why Capello seemed so stuck on Chelsea&apos;s captain. The answer was simple. Every other England player seemed diminished just by putting on the England shirt. All except for Terry, who really is the kind of person who, while everyone else is vomiting next door, or staring at their laces, strides about japing and cajoling and generally looking absolutely delighted to be there. He isn&apos;t the brains or the heart or the spine of his team. He is instead the bowels, the buried colonic centre. He ensures that Chelsea still smell like a football team. There have of course always been players who make other players play. But the Premier League is the most artificial environment yet created, one in which the in-house motivator, the equivalent of a tot of whisky and a service revolver in the spine, can seem ever more necessary, to be retained even beyond his own basic footballing usefulness. And for all the broader charge sheet, Terry remains the player who more than perhaps any other tells us what it takes to win and succeed within the peculiar airlessness of billionairism, with all its gilded incoherence, its sacrifices and its oddly stirring triumphs.", "sentences": ["There was a lot of talk about Terry&apos;s latest fancy-dress intrusion in Amsterdam, the quick-change emergence from the stands in pristine matchday kit that was, in truth, entirely harmless and even quite sweet, like the kind of boy who insists on wearing his Spider-Man suit to a wedding.", "Led by a stick-on manager, surrounded by departures and uncertainties, Chelsea just looked incredibly happy in Amsterdam."], "title": "Superman Beckham's fond farewell as Spider-Man Terry spreads magic dust | Barney Ronay", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/17/david-beckham-john-terry", "tags": ["David Beckham", "John Terry", "Football", "England", "Chelsea", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-17T21:59:01Z", "article": "Roy Hodgson&apos;s preparations for the summer friendly internationals against the Republic of Ireland and Brazil have been boosted after Chelsea indicated a willingness to release Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole and Gary Cahill early from their post-season tour of the United States.

They sit third ahead of the weekend&apos;s final round of league fixtures, two points in front of Arsenal in fourth and three of Tottenham in fifth. &quot;For sure it&apos;s a stronger team,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez, who succeed Roberto Di Matteo at the club on 21 November. &quot;The team was in transition with new players who have now improved and have experience of competing for trophies. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta is an international, David Luiz can play in a different position, Fernando Torres is stronger and more confident, and Oscar, [Eden] Hazard and [Juan] Mata are getting better every day. &quot;With some additions also the team will be better, so the new manager will have an easier task [of winning the title] because he will have more quality.&quot; Mourinho is widely thought to be that new manager, with the Portuguese&apos;s return to Stamford Bridge expected to be confirmed shortly. Ben\u00edtez intimated as much earlier this month and was at it again during his final press briefing at the club&apos;s Cobham base on Friday. Asked if he had any advice for his successor at Chelsea, the interim manager replied: &quot;Maybe the next manager will have some experience here too, so I do not need to give him any\u00a0advice.&quot; Chelsea&apos;s victory over Benfica in the Europa League final appears to have softened the view of Ben\u00edtez among the Stamford Bridge faithful, with some fans having sent messages of support and congratulations to the Spaniard since the match in Amsterdam. Many remain hostile to him, however, and that perhaps explains why Ben\u00edtez was reluctant on Friday to confirm whether or not he would take part in Chelsea&apos;s end-of-season lap of honour following the game against Everton. He instead insisted that he was solely focused on securing all three points, which would guarantee Chelsea automatic qualifying to the Champions League. Should Chelsea draw and Arsenal beat Newcastle at St James&apos; Park there remains the outside possibility of both London clubs finishing on the exact same number of points, goals scored and goals conceded. Should that occur, the Premier League has confirmed that the two sides will contest a third-place play-off match at Villa Park on Sunday 26 May, putting Chelsea&apos;s tour of\u00a0the US in serious jeopardy given they are scheduled to take part in their first match against City, in St Louis, on Thursday, with the return in New York two days later. &quot;We have been working hard so it will be a pity if we cannot guarantee top three,&quot; Ben\u00edtez said. &quot;The players know how important it is [to win against Everton].

Why, Hodgson was asked, if he wanted to bring through more young players into the England team, as he has talked about recently, did he not impose a limit on age? And not only that, how about deliberately going low with the cut-off point? Nobody 25 or over, was the suggestion, and let&apos;s see if it catches on. It&apos;s some theory. Thirteen of the 22 players Hodgson has named for the friendlies against Brazil and the Republic of Ireland fall outside that bracket. At a strike, it means Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard, Joe Hart, Frank Lampard, Michael Carrick, James Milner and Ashley Cole would be excluded from the World Cup. So would Leighton Baines, Joleon Lescott, Gary Cahill, Ben Foster, Glen Johnson, Phil Jagielka, Ashley Young and Jermain Defoe. If nothing else, it might have spared us all the palaver about whether Rio Ferdinand and John Terry will ever play for England again. Yet there aren&apos;t too many teams, as Hodgson politely tried to point out, who have gone very far with such a policy and it would be an interesting day&apos;s newspapers, to say the least, if he announced a squad with Theo Walcott and Andy Carroll as its senior players and Alex McCarthy suddenly promoted to first-choice goalkeeper. Hodgson is, however, clearly giving more thought to lowering the age of the squad and that at least feels like a start for those of us who have been saying since Euro 2012 that it was the right way to go. A group of football correspondents met him in Amsterdam before the Europa League final and it was not just the usual names he reeled off when he talked about easing out the old guard and not being scared to embrace a younger generation. Hodgson identified Aston Villa&apos;s Matthew Lowton and Ashley Westwood as players he would monitor closely next season. Wilfried Zaha, Raheem Sterling, Nathaniel Chalobah and Thomas Ince were all mentioned and he made it clear he had not eliminated Jordan Henderson from his thinking. It is true there is not a David Beckham or Paul Scholes among that number but there is Jack Wilshere and, as Hodgson pointed out, the older generation didn&apos;t exactly pull up any trees for England in major tournaments anyway. Someone mentioned the fact Gareth Barry had drifted out of the picture and Hodgson chose his words carefully. He said Barry had done well for Manchester City this season and it had reminded him that he was a good player. Then he left it at that. The subtext was clear: move on. Actions speak louder than words, of course, and it is still some way from Gary Neville&apos;s recommendation, before his recruitment to the coaching staff, that England should go exclusively with younger players or, as he put it, those &quot;not tarnished by failure and cynicism&quot;. But it was still encouraging to\u00a0hear. &quot;We aren&apos;t short,&quot; Hodgson said. &quot;We don&apos;t need to keep shackling ourselves with what we have done in the past. I think we have to take a chance elsewhere.&quot; All of which makes reasonable sense bearing in mind that England, on Hodgson&apos;s watch, are not just thinking about next year&apos;s World Cup but also the European Championship in France in 2016. But then are the times when maybe a little bit more flexibility is needed and it is not always entirely easy to understand the England manager&apos;s logic. Next month the European Under-21 Championship takes place over two weeks in Israel. There are only eight teams involved and, without wishing to stray too far from the basic principles that should be applied whenever England are involved in tournament football (rule one: never be over-confident), Stuart Pearce&apos;s side have the kind of record over the past couple of seasons that entitles them to be more confident than\u00a0usual. In the past 18 months they have beaten Belgium, Serbia (twice), Sweden, Romania, Norway, Azerbaijan, Austria and Northern Ireland. They have scored 22 times in the process and, most remarkably of all, not conceded a single goal. Israel is the chance to get the tournament experience that, as any long-serving England player will tell you, can be invaluable for the big competitions. More than that, it is about actually trying to bring back a trophy and \u2013 here&apos;s the thing \u2013 developing the winning culture that simply does not exist among the higher age group. To do that, Pearce is the same as any international manager at any level. He thinks he should be allowed to take his best possible squad. It is a pity, then, that Hodgson has decided it would be better for Phil Jones and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to go with the seniors on their four\u2011day trip to Rio de Janeiro. Not a bad place for a football match, undeniably, but still an end\u2011of\u2011season friendly, almost certainly to be played at two-thirds pace, with the likelihood that neither Jones nor Oxlade\u2011Chamberlain will start. Pearce, anticipating what was coming, had talked a while back about wanting &quot;more support&quot; from Hodgson. As it has turned out, none has been forthcoming. Sticking up for Pearce, I appreciate, is not particularly fashionable at a time when his run of results over the past couple of seasons has not been able to shift the popular perception of him as a manager lacking refinement. You may have noticed, for example, that Pearce barely warrants a mention for the various jobs that will be available this summer, even though he is out of contract at the end of June and there is absolutely no sign of the FA giving him another one. Hodgson was asked whether he would like Pearce to remain in his current role and would say only that he considered it &quot;unfair&quot; to seek his opinion when it was a matter for the FA. The invitation was there, in other words, to offer him some backing, and he declined it. And we probably all know what that means if Pearce cannot win this tournament at his fourth attempt. &quot;Let me down easy,&quot; to borrow a line from one of the Stranglers songs that punk fan Pearce knows so well. It is just a pity that amid all this talk about doing the right thing for the younger players, England&apos;s Under-21s have the chance of returning from Israel with a rare trophy and Hodgson has not been able to help. That would be a more relevant question the next time the all-parliamentary football group invites him to Westminster. Ferguson&apos;s final falling-out is a fitting exit Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s final press conference as Manchester United&apos;s manager was full of levity and humour. One of his old sparring partners at the Sun presented him with a cake in the shape of a hairdryer. There was a card and a bottle of expensive plonk and it reminded me of the time Ferguson turned 65 and the reporters on his beat were deliberating about whether or not to get him anything. Things were pretty strained at the time and it went to a vote. Two abstained, one refused &quot;unless it&apos;s Blue Nun&quot; and six chipped in a fiver each, despite collective misgivings that it made everyone look a bit desperate. Which, unfortunately, was very true. Ferguson liked his presents anyway. &quot;I&apos;ve never borne grudges,&quot; he said. &quot;In all the times I&apos;ve banned you I&apos;ve never borne a grudge to anyone. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s my style.&quot; And yet, even in the warm afterglow of his retirement announcement \u2013 a news event so seismic that, as Private Eye noted, even the Sun&apos;s Page Three girl was shifted to page nine, &quot;the true sign of a national tragedy&quot; \u2013 he still managed to conjure up one last falling\u2011out. This one was with David Meek, his ghostwriter for the past 26 years and previously described by United&apos;s manager as &quot;part of the fabric of this club&quot;. Hence the absence of any programme notes for the game against Swansea last weekend, replaced instead by Ferguson&apos;s retirement statement. Somehow it felt fitting: only Fergie could refuse to take part in a commemorative programme \u2013 &quot;Thank You Sir Alex&quot; \u2013 for his very last game at Old Trafford. Mancini does not deserve all the poison That was a classy touch from Roberto Mancini to take out a full-page advertisement in the Manchester Evening News on Saturday to say &quot;ciao&quot; to the Manchester City supporters. What a shame there are so many people inside the club who want to tarnish what he achieved in better times. Mancini has certainly taken a fair old kicking over the past week even before we get to the fact that not a single City player on Twitter has deemed his sacking worthy of a mention. It has been an extraordinary series of leaks and allegations, and what a delicious irony that the former kit-man who got in first, describing the Italian as &quot;arrogant, vain and self-centred&quot;, did so from a Twitter account where in his profile picture he is clutching a bottle of champagne from the day Mancini&apos;s team won the title. This column has made it clear that Mancini was vulnerable because of a) the politics at City and b) the fact they were having such an undistinguished season. Only the naive could possibly have believed otherwise. All the same, the spreading of poison reflects well on nobody.", "sentences": ["A group of football correspondents met him in Amsterdam before the Europa League final and it was not just the usual names he reeled off when he talked about easing out the old guard and not being scared to embrace a younger generation."], "title": "Stuart Pearce's plea for Roy Hodgson's help needs backing | Daniel Taylor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/18/englandfootballteam-roy-hodgson", "tags": ["England", "Roy Hodgson", "England Under-21s", "Stuart Pearce", "European Under-21 Championship", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-18T22:48:00Z", "article": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez, having completed his final press conference at Chelsea&apos;s Cobham training ground on Friday, shook hands with the journalists present and wished them well. It was a goodbye of sorts ahead of the Spaniard&apos;s final competitive match as the club&apos;s interim manager but as far as his time in England is concerned Ben\u00edtez does not want Sunday afternoon&apos;s visit of Everton to be the end. Instead the 53-year-old is keen to return to management as soon as possible, which may come as a surprise given the difficult nature of his six-month tenure at Stamford Bridge, played out as it has been against a backdrop of hostility and mockery from the club&apos;s supporters. But with Chelsea all but qualified for the Champions League and having bagged the Europa League on a heady night in Amsterdam, Ben\u00edtez is ready for more. &quot;There are different options but I do not see too many top sides in England at the moment,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe I will have to look at other opportunities around the world. But my idea is to stay in England.&quot; Ben\u00edtez was then asked if he would join only a high-ranking club in this country, to which he replied: &quot;Yes, or one with a project.&quot; So he could be interested in a club lower down in the Premier League but with ambitions to rise higher? &quot;It depends on the project,&quot; he said. &quot;I have to analyse everything because I want to stay around and compete.&quot; The answers were short and vague but ultimately told everything. This is a man who feels refreshed rather than drained by his time at Chelsea and is so determined to carry on working that he could countenance moving to a place where the prospect of managing a player of the calibre of Juan Mata and of competing for major European honours is a distant dream. Some may call that desperation but Ben\u00edtez simply appears to not want to slide back into the shadows, as he did after being sacked by Internazionale in December 2010. He had to wait 23 months to be employed again, with Roberto Di Matteo&apos;s dismissal at Chelsea offering the former Liverpool manager a route back to the Premier League, and while he spoke about being patient and waiting for the right opportunity to come about, Ben\u00edtez also reiterated his desire to be in employment by the start of next season. &quot;There have been no official offers, but that is my idea,&quot; he said. Staying at Chelsea appears not to be an option. While some fans have warmed to the Spaniard \u2013 Ben\u00edtez claims to have received emails of support and congratulations after the Europa League final win against Benfica \u2013 most remain against him. Besides, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho appears certain to return shortly, with Ben\u00edtez suggesting as much himself on Friday. He leaves with head held high, however. Chelsea face Everton knowing victory would guarantee third place, and while the side were disappointed in the Club World Cup in Japan and by losing to Swansea in the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup, securing the Europa League and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they gave Manchester City a game, means, overall, it has been a good season for a club thrown in to familiar turmoil by Di Matteo&apos;s departure. Ben\u00edtez also leaves behind an increasingly impressive team, with David Luiz having developed into an influential central midfielder under the Spaniard and Fernando Torres showing flickers of his old self, no more so than with his goal against Benfica. &quot;The team has improved, it has more balance, more experience and we achieved what we were looking for. So it is quite positive,&quot; Ben\u00edtez said. &quot;It will be sad [to leave] because I can see in training how the players are improving, the understanding between them, the understanding between us. This is a top side, a top club, the players are good, so there a lot of managers who can do a good job here.&quot; After Sunday Ben\u00edtez will manage Chelsea in two friendlies against Manchester City in the US later this month, or in the unlikely but possible event of them finishing on the same points, goals scored and goals conceded as Arsenal, in a third-place play-off against them at Villa Park on Sunday 26 May. Then it will be time to find a new club or a new &quot;project&quot;.

Their environmental credentials are controversial, but a handful of countries are now looking at them from another angle entirely: they want to use biofuels to try to reduce poverty among rural smallholder farmers. Such efforts are in full force in Brazil, a country that is home to both a sizeable biofuels industry and about 4.1m small-scale family farms. But while some of the country&apos;s biofuels policies have fallen short, others have proved a boon to the rural poor. Smallholder farmers have seen their incomes rise thanks to the introduction of more progressive standards and new rules on contract negotiations. &quot;The numbers show that the farmers in Brazil \u2026 have been earning far more than they were before \u2013 not only in absolute quantities, but also as a percentage of the whole value of the [biofuels production] chain,&quot; says Mairon Bastos Lima, a PhD researcher at the Institute for Environmental Studies at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the author of a recent briefing paper (pdf) that looked at the social impacts of biofuels polices in Brazil, India, and Indonesia. Bastos Lima describes the Brazilian biofuels policies as &quot;the best example&quot; he has seen. In most cases, he says, smallholder farmers who cultivate biofuels are included only in the lowest level of the production chain. That means that most of the wealth from production accrues to the refiners, or to the company that is managing the process, not to the farmers themselves. But in Brazil this has started to change, albeit slowly. This success, Bastos Lima says, is largely due to the fact that Petrobras, Brazil&apos;s state-run energy giant, created its own biofuels division in 2008. The new state company took over from the private firms that had been running the government&apos;s biofuels production contracts with smallholder farmers in north-eastern Brazil. When Petrobras came on the scene, the company introduced a number of changes. It required that farmers devote no more than 20% of their arable land to growing the precursors to biofuels; the rest of their farms had to be reserved for edible crops. This &quot;mixed food and feed-stock&quot; policy helps to guarantee that the farmers maintain a steady food supply, regardless of what happens in the biofuels market. Petrobras also introduced a policy of including social movements in all of its contract negotiations with smallholder farmers. Under the current policy, any contractual agreement with farmers is not valid until a rural social movement has signed off on it. &quot;This balances the bargaining power,&quot; says Bastos Lima, &quot;because suddenly you cannot put pressure on one individual household&quot; to accept the terms of an agreement. The impact of the change is already being felt. &quot;Social movements had to fight really hard with Petrobras to actually stand their ground and say, &apos;no, we want to climb up at least one step in the value chain \u2026 and have more of an income&apos;,&quot; says Bastos Lima. The number of households involved in Brazil&apos;s smallholder biofuels production programme quadrupled between 2008 and 2010; more than 100,000 families are now involved. In 2010, the Brazilian government bought roughly $635m (\u00a3413m) worth of biofuels feedstock from its smallholder farmers, a fivefold increase from two years earlier. But while Brazil has had some success with its efforts to include smallholder farmers in the biofuels production chain, things have not always gone so well in other places, warns Bastos Lima. &quot;The case of India has been particularly disastrous,&quot; he says, noting that the Indian government placed a huge bet on a plant called jatropha, which was widely hailed as the next big breakthrough in biofuels back in 2007 and 2008. Inspired by promising scientific studies, the government called for the cultivation of jatropha on more than 11m hectares (27m acres) of land. But then reality set in: the crop&apos;s yields were disappointing, and many Indian farmers were left with reduced incomes, coupled with a smaller supply of food to give their own families. Such experiences demonstrate why more work needs to be done to understand the social consequences of biofuels production, says Chris Charles, a project manager in the Geneva office of the International Institute for Sustainable Development. &quot;There&apos;s a real lack of research \u2013 quantitative and qualitative research \u2013 assessing \u2026 the extent of the negative or positive impacts on smallholder farmers,&quot; says Charles. &quot;Campaigning groups publish very emotional pieces showing small farmers in Asia, for example, being displaced from their land by large monoculture biofuel operations. [But] it&apos;s hard to know how academic or rigorous that analysis is.&quot; \u2022 This article was corrected on 21 May 2013.

Bakker, who took the \u20ac100,000 Impac prize for his debut novel The Twin, narrowly beat Argentinian author Andr\u00e9s Neuman to win the Independent award for The Detour. The award goes to the best work of contemporary fiction in translation and has been won in the past by Jos\u00e9 Saramago and Orhan Pamuk. Judges including the novelists Elif Shafak and Gabriel Josipovici were won over by its themes of &quot;infidelity, exile and isolation&quot;, they said. Bakker, who works as a gardener as well as writing fiction, said that &quot;to win so unexpectedly was so wonderful&quot;. He also beat Man Booker International prize winner Ismail Kadare to take this year&apos;s award. &quot;The prize is good because it means sales, and sales mean money for plants for my garden,&quot; he said. The Detour is the story of Emilie, an Emily Dickinson scholar who flees to Wales after an affair. A young man ends up staying with her to help out in her remote farmhouse, while in Amsterdam her husband enlists a detective to find her. John Burnside&apos;s review in the Guardian called it &quot;even more powerful&quot; than its &quot;accomplished&quot; predecessor, The Twin. &quot;The Detour is a beautiful, oddly moving work of fiction, a quiet read that lingers long in the mind, like the ghosts that linger in our homes, and in the land around us,&quot; he wrote. Independent literary editor and judge of the prize Boyd Tonkin said the novel was &quot;swift-moving and apparently straightforward, but with mysterious hidden depths&quot;. &quot;The Detour is a novel that grips its reader tight and never lets go,&quot; he said. &quot;Gerbrand Bakker&apos;s tale of a Dutch woman who goes missing from her own troubled life and seeks refuge in rural Wales combines mesmeric storytelling with an uncanny sense of place, and an atmosphere of brooding, irresistible menace. In David Colmer&apos;s pitch-perfect and immersive translation, this book will both linger in your imagination and, quite possibly, haunt your dreams as well.&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve been to North Wales often, I know the land, and I&apos;d always thought I would like to write something about it,&quot; said Bakker. &quot;But you need more. And then the three things came together \u2013 the Emily Dickinson poem, &quot;Ample Make This Bed&quot;, which is the motto, and this Dutchwoman, sitting in a completely strange landscape. That was the moment I realised I could write it. I like quiet environments \u2013 then things start to happen. If I set a novel in a big city, maybe nothing would happen \u2013 it doesn&apos;t inspire me.&quot; Bakker will share his \u00a310,000 prize money with the novel&apos;s translator, David Colmer. &quot;It&apos;s only fitting, that a narrative centred on a Dutch woman in a foreign country, around language and translation, is honoured by the Independent Foreign Fiction prize,&quot; said Antonia Byatt, director of Arts Council England, which funds the prize. &quot;It lingers in the mind and the emotions long after reading it, like all compelling and complex stories.

Imagine a world in which we are all in the dark about a company&apos;s environmental footprint, its human rights record, supply chains, or commitment to gender equality. A world where transparency and accountability are seen as needless niceties. In short, a world where we are safe in the knowledge that we have no knowledge. That world is almost unimaginable in the post-internet, post-financial crisis world in which we live, but it is not long ago that reporting the impacts that companies have on the environment, economy and society was a mere idea. Twenty years ago, there was no Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and no company published sustainability reports. Fast forward 10 years and there were a mere smattering of pioneers. Even five years ago, when I met leaders of some of the world&apos;s largest corporations, the level of understanding could be described as mixed at best. That has changed. The idea of turning back the clock now is so unthinkable that it underscores just how far sustainability reporting has come in a very short period of time. More than 4,000 organisations report their sustainability performance and impacts using GRI guidelines, including 80% of the world&apos;s 250 largest corporations. As more than 1,500 thought leaders and practitioners from around the world gather in Amsterdam for the start of GRI&apos;s Global Conference on sustainability and reporting today, it is clear that the need for transparency is high on the agenda, not just for business, but for a wide range of actors including investors, governments and civil society. But there is still a long way to go. The question isn&apos;t therefore if we should report, but how to get more reporters and better reporting \u2013 to use GRI&apos;s maxim \u2013 in order to better inform markets and key stakeholders alike. First, however, what makes a good report? Of course, it must be credible, reliable, robust and many other adjectives besides, but the key is that it be relevant and strategic. This means that it contains the right information for the right people. The tragic loss of life in a Bangladeshi garment factory last month underlines just how important it is that material disclosures on labour conditions be included in sustainability reports. And publishing this information in a sustainability report must not be the start and end of the process. Reporting is a journey \u2013 and that means instituting changes right across the organisation, from shop floor to the boardroom. Having more reporters will continue to be one of GRI&apos;s overriding priorities. Governments acting alone and in concert, together with stock exchanges, are drivers for change. The &quot;report or explain&quot; approach adopted by the governments of Denmark, France and India, together with stock markets in Brazil, South Africa and China, is a simple but highly effective step by policymakers. Companies have to publish sustainability reports or if they choose not to, declare why. The European Commission&apos;s proposal last month that large companies across the EU disclose sustainability information as part of their annual reporting cycle is a hugely positive development, and bodes well for the future. Better reporting is every bit as important as more reporters. Many people are concerned about greenwash, and I am one of them. But whenever there is a problem with transparency in any walk of life \u2013 for instance, in government \u2013 the response is never to do away with transparency and accountability. Instead, it is to call for more and better transparency. The corporate sector is no different. The fourth generation of the GRI guidelines, G4, to be launched today at GRI&apos;s global sustainability conference will drive sustainability reporting in a number of key ways. Principal among them is the increased focus on materiality, which will lead to more focused sustainability reports. And more focused reports will in turn make it less likely that undesirable impacts are camouflaged or overlooked. More material reports will also help provide a more comprehensive three-dimensional picture of how sustainable a company really is, meeting the demands of markets and investors for more accurate and comparable sustainability information in the process. The demand from markets, investors and other stakeholders to conduct benchmarking and sector-wide analysis is already there. What has been missing has been a critical mass of comparable data on companies&apos; sustainability performance and impacts. Sustainability reporting simply cannot afford to stand still and must evolve with the needs of reporters, users, investors and other stakeholders. GRI&apos;s vision is radical: a sustainable global economy. The days of tick box reporting are over. The next phase of the reporting revolution \u2013 the mainstreaming of sustainability reporting \u2013 is G4. Ernst Ligteringen is chief executive of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

The master scolded it: &quot;I&apos;ve not asked you to move! I just wanted to show him an example!&quot; On the surface, of course this tale shows what has been mankind&apos;s dream since time immemorial: to create, to change, to move, to destroy, to rebuild the world with words. Just with words! Who hasn&apos;t dreamed of being able to say: &quot;Let there be light!&quot; and to see light appear? Yet beyond this fanciful quest, there is something in that tale which makes me wonder about the link between the power and speech of wise men [and women], intellectuals and writers. First, about asking a mountain to move and getting it to move: I interpret this allegorically (and perhaps naively) as a pragmatic aspect of language, its transitive function. And I don&apos;t just mean in our daily conversations, but also in a literary text. Then, about the fact that the wise man just gives an &quot;example&quot;, and that the example becomes a commandment: that opens a debate on the notion of exemplarity and metalanguage in literature. Everyone undoubtedly remembers the following title, which is magical in French: &quot;Quand dire c&apos;est faire.&quot; In English it is &quot;How to Do Things with Words&quot;, written by John Langshaw Austin. This English philosopher means a series of sentences which aren&apos;t simply a string of words that explain a state or a situation \u2026 They become the very act they describe. Once uttered, they can change a life or a community&apos;s life dramatically. For instance &quot;I now pronounce you man and wife&quot; used by a mayor. Or &quot;War is declared&quot; used by a statesman, who, just by uttering these words, throws his people in the great madness and terror it involves \u2026 A few centuries ago, in Amsterdam&apos;s synagogue, a sermon banished Baruch Spinoza from the Jewish community and condemned him to silence. And more recently, a &quot;fatwa&quot; forced Salman Rushdie into concealment \u2026 Believers say that the universe is created by the very words of God. And even if we don&apos;t believe it, we still witness the way the words attributed to God lead men to action, whether on the path of wisdom or the madness of suicide attacks \u2026 But you might ask: is this the doing of the power of words \u2026 or of the words of power? Langshaw Austin said it well: for a performative utterance to be &quot;fortunate&quot;, in other words feasible, you need the right set of circumstances. You can&apos;t just have anyone pronounce any couple man and wife! First and foremost, the person who unites the two must have some legitimacy and some power. Then, the couple must fulfil certain conditions and so on. And to get a mountain to move, you have to gain some wisdom first. In order to shout &quot;I accuse&quot;, you have to be Zola first. And to be Zola, you have to have written Nana, Germinal, La B\u00eate Humaine \u2026 &quot;It is splendid to be a great writer,&quot; said Flaubert, &quot;to put men into the frying pan of your words and make them pop like chestnuts. There must be a delirious pride in the feeling that you are bringing the full weight of your ideas to bear on mankind. But for that you must have something to say.&quot; When the writer has something to say, does it follow that he changes anything in the world? Jean-Paul Sartre would reply yes, because for him, saying things means wanting to change them; talking or writing means acting on the world.     Marx the novelist would have had far less impact on the world. Nicholson/Corbis    Bright minds will probably ask: if writers wield such power with their speech, why is the world torn in [to] a thousand pieces? Why is there so much tyranny, war and injustice? Where do we find ourselves, after Germinal, after War and Peace, after A Farewell to Arms, after The Plague \u2026? What is literature up to? Alas, another question that sentences literature to uncertainty.  &quot;Clearly, if Marx had followed his dreams of youth and written the most beautiful novel in the world, he would have held the world spellbound, but he wouldn&apos;t have moved it. You therefore have to write Capital and not War and Peace. You don&apos;t describe Caesar&apos;s murder, you have to be Brutus \u2026 Making such links, such comparisons, might seem absurd to onlookers. But when art is weighed against action, immediate and pressing, action can only consider art as wrong, and art can only concur&quot;.   Maurice Blanchot said these words. And he is not wrong. Even Sartre, a keen supporter of politically engaged literature, said in a fit of despair: &quot;When a child is dying, Nausea seems very lightweight&quot;! Or Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin: &quot;\u2026 what are poets good for in times of trouble?&quot; But before sinking into unfathomable despair, let&apos;s reassure poets: You are here precisely to tell us what poets are good for in times of trouble. Because by telling us that, poets name, define and recall the nature of our lives in these &quot;times of trouble&quot;. Just as Shams Tabrizi, master of Rumi, a mystic Persian in the 13th century: &quot;We are not able to talk,If only we could listen!We must say all!And listen to all!ButOur ears are sealedOur lips are sealedOur hearts are sealed.&quot; This cry has echoed for centuries to denounce the permanent and implacable censorship that is breathed into the heart of writers, in Iran just as well as in Afghanistan (my country of origin), where in actual fact words defy tyranny. In those countries, the existential problem isn&apos;t &quot;to be or not to be \u2026&quot; but to say or not to say. Thus, any act becomes political. Even silence. Even lies. I remember that when soviets were in Afghanistan, a brilliant saying from Poland was used by intellectuals: &quot;If you want to survive, don&apos;t think. If you think, don&apos;t talk. If you talk, don&apos;t write. If you write, don&apos;t sign it. If you sign it, don&apos;t be surprised!&quot; Unfortunately, this still goes for my native country, even if the new post-Taliban constitution allows freedom of the press. But the problem lies elsewhere; it lies in each of us, because our hearts are sealed. In the south of Afghanistan, Pashtun women have a poetic tradition called landay. These are short, anonymous poems, which reveal a lot, like for instance:  &quot;Lay your lips on mineBut leave my tongue free, that I may tell you I love you&quot;  Imagine what would happen to that woman if she signed this! This is how, by describing the conditions of mankind or by revealing humanity&apos;s desires and dreams, a literary text can become a cry, an act of proclamation. It &quot;gives a syntax to the cry&quot;, as Deleuze would put it. It is a performative utterance. And even if that cry doesn&apos;t waken slumbering spirits, at least it might trouble their sleep! Such an act isn&apos;t a provocation, but a pro-vocation. In that sense, politics isn&apos;t the will, the fear or the duty of the writer. It is in the ink of its writing. Writers aren&apos;t &quot;engaged&quot; in History, they are &quot;embarked&quot; in it, as Camus coins it, using Pascal&apos;s wording. Now, let&apos;s talk about the other aspect of the literary experience, its exemplarity. &quot;Man&apos;s world is the planet of inexperience&quot; said Milan Kundera, &quot;Inexperience is a quality of the human condition. We are born one time only; we never start a new life equipped with the experience we&apos;ve gained from a previous one.&quot; It is because this world is a planet of inexperience that literature has a meaning. Given that we don&apos;t live a permanent experience, literature helps us conceive the life of others (of those who lived before our time, or those who live at the same time as we do but elsewhere), as a pointer, perhaps even a mimetic desire, as Ren\u00e9 Girard put it. We live and so we think with and through other people&apos;s experiences, just as others live with and through our writing as an existential, sentimental, political, metaphysical experience. Salman Rushdie said: &quot;It is literature which for me opened the mysterious and decisive doors of imagination and understanding. To see the way others see. To think the way others think. And above all, to feel.&quot; Denis Diderot said: &quot;Reading novels makes us better people, not only because fictions illustrate abstract principles, or because characters show us what behaviors to adopt or avoid, but also because it turns the empathy felt by the reader into an experience of the other, therefore an altruist experience.&quot; In that sense, an experience isn&apos;t just &quot;personal experience&quot;, it isn&apos;t just past; it isn&apos;t a &quot;study&quot;, a scientific experiment carried out to check or justify knowledge data, which would make it a future-oriented act. It is the proof of our existence here and now. It is the act of meditating on what we live. It is living the world as the world lives us. It is an &quot;inner experience&quot; for George Bataille and an &quot;original experience&quot; for Maurice Blanchot. Writing is an experience with language, ie with oneself. It is an experience which helps me see the world within myself, so I can deconstruct it in order to understand it, and then rebuild it as I wish. By changing the world bit by bit, one day we will change the world. So, should we still doubt the political dimension of literature? First, I&apos;d say YES! We must doubt it because as Paul Val\u00e9ry says, &quot;politics means wanting to conquer and to retain power; it therefore involves an action of constraint or of illusion over minds which are the essence of all power (\u2026)&quot; The political mind always ends up forced into forgery. It introduces a forged intellectual currency onto the market; it introduces forged historical notions; it builds specious reasoning arguments; in a word, it does anything it can to keep its authority, its so-called moral authority. And then, I&apos;d say NO, because literature is a fight against all political systems. It is the power of words against the words of power. Thus the definition of politics in writing. \u2022 This is an edited version of Atiq Rahimi&apos;s keynote speech to the Edinburgh World Writers&apos; Conference: St Malo presented by Etonnants Voyageurs in partnership with the Edinburgh International Book Festival and the British Council, 18 - 20 May 2013.

It was a dull, staid place where, as Albert Camus wrote in the Fall, published in 1955, &quot;for centuries, pipe smokers have been watching the same rain falling on the same canal&quot;. Yet within a decade it had become the heart of the youth revolution and had begun to nurture revolutionary ideas. Among them was Ajax, a football team that if not the greatest there has ever been, was almost certainly the most influential. Speak to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger or Arrigo Sacchi, Marcelo Bielsa or Pep Guardiola, and all, to an extent, have drawn their philosophies from the team created by Rinus Michels. As David Winner demonstrates in Brilliant Orange, Dutch football in the time Camus was writing of was dismal. The national side won only two of 27 internationals between June 1949 and April 1955 but the coming of professionalism in 1954 provided a stimulus. It was a culture with few preconceptions and little to lose; it was open to change. Ajax&apos;s revolution was the development of pressing \u2013 independent from and simultaneous with the same process being enacted under Viktor Maslov at Dynamo Kyiv. It&apos;s a style of play that requires great physical preparedness \u2013 it would have been impossible in an amateur context. By the time of Michels, not only was professionalism established, but the shortages of the war years were over, nutrition was good and sports science (both legal and illicit) had advanced sufficiently that players could keep running for 90 minutes. The seeds of Ajax&apos;s development had been sown by Jack Reynolds, who had played for Grimsby, Sheffield Wednesday and Watford before moving to Switzerland in 1912. He had three stints as coach of Ajax, the last of them immediately after the war, which he spent interned in a camp at Tost, where PG Wodehouse was also detained. Reynolds believed in attacking, passing football and ensured all levels of the club played in the same style. One of his pupils was Michels. It was only in 1959 with the appointment of Vic Buckingham, schooled in the best passing traditions by Peter McWilliam at Tottenham, that the seeds began to sprout. Six years later, he was succeeded by Michels, who led Ajax to the title in his first season. That this might have more than local significance was demonstrated the following season as they thrashed Liverpool 5-1 in the European Cup. Still the style was developing. Michels had changed the shape to 4-2-4 and encouraged a passing, possession-based game, but there was no sense of systematised pressing at that stage. There was, though, a radicalism in the air. Amsterdam in the 1960s was, as the British anarchist Charles Radcliffe put it, &quot;the capital of the youth rebellion&quot;. Provos, dressed all in white, staged anti-consumerist demonstrations and art became increasingly avant garde. The key moment came in 1966 with the wedding of Princess Beatrix to Claus von Amsberg, a German aristocrat who had served in the Wehrmacht. Police set about protestors demonstrating against their marriage with batons, prompting such revulsion that tolerance became official policy. Within a couple of years Dam Square had become a camp for foreign hippies and the Amsterdam police had a reputation as the most easy-going in Europe. It is no coincidence that it was at the Amsterdam Hilton in 1969 that John Lennon and Yoko Ono celebrated their marriage with a week-long bed-in. Perhaps there were no direct links between the Provos and Ajax but the football of Ajax developed in an age when questioning the orthodoxy was the norm; everything could be challenged. Johan Cruyff became an icon of the burgeoning Dutch youth movement of the time. In 1997, in a piece in Hard Gras magazine marking Cruyff&apos;s 50th birthday, the journalist Hubert Smeets wrote that: &quot;Cruyff was the first player who understood that he was an artist, and the first who was able and willing to collectivise the art of sports&quot;. In a piece in issue three of the Blizzard, Simon Kuper and David Winner argue that Ajax played the same role in the Netherlands as the Beatles played in England. &quot;The Dutch,&quot; Smeets went on, &quot;are at their best when they can combine the system with individual creativity. Johan Cruyff is the main representative of that. He made this country after the war. I think he was the only one who understood the sixties.&quot; That notion of individuality within a system was characteristic of the Netherlands at the time. Indeed, the prefix &quot;totaal&quot;, first attached to football after the performances of the national team at the 1974 World Cup, was used across a range of disciplines to express that relationship between individual and system. The architectural theorist JB Bakema, who wrote for the influential Forum magazine, spoke of Total Urbanisation, Total Environment and Total Energy. &quot;To understand things,&quot; he said in a lecture given in 1974, &quot;you have to understand the relationship between things \u2026 Once the highest image of interrelationship in society was indicated by the word God; and man was allowed to use earth and universal space under condition that he should care for what he used. But we have to actualise this kind of care and respect since man came by his awareness nearer the phenomenon of interrelationship called the relation of atoms. Man became aware of his being part of a total energy system.&quot; After beating Liverpool in 1966-67, Ajax lost to Dukla Prague in the quarter-final, something that prompted Michels to reshape his defence, bringing in the tough Serbian sweeper Velibor Vasovic from Partizan. Ajax won the league four times between 1966 and 1970, and also lost in the final of the European Cup to Milan in 1969. It was that achievement that captured the imagination of the Dutch public, with over 40,000 travelling to Paris to watch a play-off against Benfica after Ajax had overcome a 3-1 deficit from the home leg to draw 4-4 on aggregate in the quarter-final. &quot;I played the last man in defence, the libero,&quot; said Vasovic. &quot;Michels made this plan to play very offensive football. We discussed it. I was the architect, together with Michels, of the aggressive way of defending.&quot; The pressing aspect stemmed largely from Johan Neeskens&apos;s aggression. He was usually deputed to pick up the opposing playmaker and the coach Bobby Haarms described him as being &quot;like a kamikaze pilot&quot; as he pursued him, often deep into opposition territory. At first other Ajax players hung back, but by the early 1970s they had become used to following him. That meant they were playing a very high defensive line, squeezing the space in which the opposition had to play. That was risky, but Vasovic was adept at stepping out to catch opposing forwards offside. Vasovic was a rarity. Most of the side had grown up together through the academy and so became capable of what Buckingham called &quot;habit football&quot;, instinctively knowing where their team-mates would be. The intermovement of Ajax was to a large extent organic. &quot;When I saw [Wim] Suurbier going forward, I knew I had to go back,&quot; Sjaak Swart said. &apos;I didn&apos;t have to be told. And after two years everybody knew what to do.&quot; That is not, though, to downplay the role of Michels, who oversaw and encouraged the intermovement, particularly as teams began to play with massed defences against Ajax. &quot;I tried to find guidelines that meant we could surprise a little those walls,&quot; he said. &quot;I had to let midfield players and defensive players participate in the building up and in the attacking. It&apos;s easy to say, but it&apos;s a long way to go because the most difficult thing is not to teach a full-back to participate in attacking \u2013 because he likes that \u2013 but to find somebody else who is covering up. In the end, when you see they have the mobility, the positional game of such a team makes everyone think: &apos;I can participate too. It&apos;s very easy&apos;. And then you have reached the top, the paramount of the development.&quot; Shifting from 4-2-4 to 4-3-3 made that switching of positions rather easier to structure, because it tended to happen either down one flank or down the middle. So Suurbier, Arie Haan and Swart interchanged on the right; Vasovic (or later Horst Blankenburg or Barry Hulshoff), Neeskens and Cruyff down the middle; and Ruud Krol, Gerrie M\u00fchren and Piet Keizer on the left. &quot;People couldn&apos;t see that sometimes we just did things automatically,&quot; said Hulshoff. &quot;It comes from playing a long time together. Football is best when it&apos;s instinctive. This way of playing, we grew into it. Total Football means that a player in attack can play in defence \u2013 only that he can do this, that is all. You make space, you come into space. And if the ball doesn&apos;t come, you leave this space and another player will come into it.&quot; The tangible evidence that Ajax had reached the &quot;paramount of development&quot; came in 1971 as they beat Panathinaikos in the European Cup final, following up the success of Feyenoord a year before to mark the Netherlands as the new centre of European football. Michels left for Barcelona after that, and Ajax turned to the avuncular Romanian Stefan Kovacs. He relaxed the reins, and it was under him that Ajax probably played their best football, attacking with greater freedom than Michels had ever allowed them. &quot;Kovacs was a good coach,&quot; M\u00fchren said, &quot;but he was too nice. Michels was more professional. He was very strict, with everyone on the same level. In the first year with Kovacs we played even better because we were good players who had been given freedom. But after that the discipline went and it was all over. We didn&apos;t have the same spirit. We could have been champions of Europe forever if we&apos;d stayed together.&quot; Certainly it was in 1971-72 that Ajax were at their most fluent, as Kovacs replaced Vasovic with Blankenburg and encouraged him, Suurbier and Krol to advance, safe in the knowledge that Neeskens, Haan and M\u00fchren could drop in to cover. Vasovic himself always insisted Kovacs&apos;s impact was minimal. &quot;Those who say Total Football started with Kovacs are wrong,&quot; he said shortly before his death in 2002. &quot;Kovacs had nothing to do with it. He simply took over a very good team, the champions of Europe, and let them continue the way they had already been playing.&quot; Such were the doubts about Kovacs that only a player revolt saved him from the sack in April 1972, shortly after a goalless draw at Benfica had confirmed their progress to a second successive European Cup final. At the time, Ajax were five points clear in the league, had just hammered Feyenoord 5-1 in Rotterdam and had reached the Dutch Cup final. &quot;The results show that Kovacs was not wrong,&quot; Cruyff said. &quot;Our team was ready to take part in making decisions.&quot; They went on to beat Internazionale 2-0 in the final. &quot;Ajax proved that creative attack is the real lifeblood of the game,&quot; the report in the Times read the following morning, &quot;that blanket defence can be outwitted and outmanoeuvred, and by doing so they made the outlines of the night a little sharper and the shadows a little brighter.&quot; The following year, by winning the European Cup again, Ajax became the first side since Real Madrid to complete a hat-trick of titles. Appropriately, having hammered Bayern Munich 4-0 in the first leg of the quarter-final, it was Real Madrid whom Ajax beat in the semi. The aggregate score of 3-1 barely did justice to their superiority, and the tie is better remembered for M\u00fchren&apos;s keepie-ups in the second leg at the Bernab\u00e9u, a moment of arrogance and joie de vivre that encapsulated the ethos of Kovacs&apos;s Ajax. &quot;I knew I was going to give the ball to Krol, but I needed some time until he reached me,&quot; M\u00fchren recalled. &quot;So I juggled until he arrived. You can&apos;t plan to do something like that. You don&apos;t think about that. You just do it. It was the moment when Ajax and Real Madrid changed positions. Before then it was always the big Real Madrid and the little Ajax. When they saw me doing that, the balance changed. The Real Madrid players were looking. They nearly applauded. The stadium was standing up. It was the moment Ajax took over.&quot; In Belgrade in the final, they beat Juventus 1-0, but it was as emphatic as a one-goal victory can be as, having taken a fourth-minute lead, Ajax taunted the Italians with long strings of passes \u2013 what we might today think of as sterile domination but at the time seemed a thrilling daring way of humiliating beaten opponents. But that was the end. Freedom became decadence and at the end of the season, in circumstances that have never been fully explained, Cruyff lost the vote to be captain. He went to join Michels at Barcelona, and it wouldn&apos;t be until he returned as coach over a decade later than Ajax again won a European trophy.", "sentences": ["It&apos;s difficult now, given the city&apos;s reputation for liberalism and excess to imagine Amsterdam in the years following the second world war.", "Amsterdam in the 1960s was, as the British anarchist Charles Radcliffe put it, &quot;the capital of the youth rebellion&quot;.", "Within a couple of years Dam Square had become a camp for foreign hippies and the Amsterdam police had a reputation as the most easy-going in Europe.", "It is no coincidence that it was at the Amsterdam Hilton in 1969 that John Lennon and Yoko Ono celebrated their marriage with a week-long bed-in."], "title": "The great European Cup teams: Ajax 1971-73 | Jonathan Wilson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/22/great-european-cup-teams-ajax", "tags": ["Ajax", "Champions League", "European club football", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-22T14:57:19Z", "article": "Women are still working in a man&apos;s world. This was the conclusion I reached at the Inclusive Museum, a global conference that annually brings together hundreds of passionate museum professionals committed to opening up their institutions. A core part of this year&apos;s programme focused on the topic of gender mainstreaming, defined by the Council of Europe as &quot;the (re)organisation, improvement, development and evaluation of policy processes, so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all policies at all levels and at all stages&quot;. Gender mainstreaming emerged as a strategy towards global equity by 1995, after it was addressed at the UN&apos;s fourth world conference of the Beijing Platform for Action. The concept was endorsed by the EU via the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997 and back in the UK, the Gender Equality Duty Act subsequently took force in 2007 to ensure public authorities promoted gender equality in all their functions as well as carried out and published gender impact assessments for all new legislation, policies, employment and service delivery changes. Evidence of gender equality schemes can be found online for most national museums. But although the rhetoric appears affirmative, many of these policies now need updating. This provided the focus for a conference workshop where key stakeholders reflected on the extent to which museums have embedded the gender mainstreaming ethos, and came up with a set of recommendations for remedial action. It was fitting that the venue for the workshop was the Karen Blixen room of the Royal Library, Copenhagen, also known as the Black Diamond because of its shimmering, cuboid-shaped exterior, and home to a burgeoning collection on gender studies. The panel was chaired by Hans Martin-Hinz, president of International Council of Museums and Elisabeth M\u00f8ller Jensen, director of KVINFO, the Danish Centre for Information on Gender, Equality and Diversity. Jensen lamented the paradox facing women in Denmark: &quot;in terms of numbers of women in work we top the European list, but we trail equally impressively at the bottom for numbers of women in leadership roles&quot;. While Danish women no longer have to choose between family and work, she said, there is an ongoing tussle between family and career. I echoed this in my own contribution, questioning how we can change the &apos;man&apos;s world&apos; paradigm to something that works best for the whole of society. How women are represented in museum displays lies at the heart of the issue. Merete Ipsen, director of Denmarks&apos; Museum of Women, described the value of a state-recognised national museum specialising in research and building collections that represent the lives and topical themes of Danish women through the ages. And Sheena Laursen from the Experimentarium highlighted the role of museums and science centres in thwarting gender stereotypes through the landmark TWIST (Towards Women in Science and Technology) project. The contribution of women must be visible in all public and spaces, delegates agreed, not just in the narratives of exhibitions, but the artworks on display, currently overwhelmingly by male artists. &quot;Women need to embrace men&quot; said New Delhi textiles curator Jasleen Dhamija, and we need more male and female champions of this issue to emerge from the cultural and museum sectors. A good example is Amareswar Galla, executive director of the International Institute for the Inclusive Museum, who nurtured this initiative from concept to fruition. There was consensus that gender mainstreaming should not be the sole concern of women \u2013 it ought to be everyone&apos;s business and this imperative has become more urgent if we are to achieve the UN millennium goals set for delivery by 2015 to &quot;promote gender equality and empower women&quot;. What strategies can museums adopt to achieve this vision? We came up with a list of three key challenges and proposed solutions, before selecting recommendations that we believe will make the biggest overall difference: \u2022 What are the key indicators of equal gender representation across the cultural sector? We recommend that museums monitor the stories they tell from a gender perspective. \u2022 How do we monitor and evaluate gender representation? We recommend that museums work with audiences, staff, and programmes from a gender perspective. \u2022 What policies could identify possible gender gaps and inequalities, and eliminate these factors? We recommend that museums proactively address the intersections between gender, race, age and class. These recommendations along with the original questions will be sent to the ICOM executive council and the Danish Cultural Agency for endorsement and a follow up conference is planned to ensure action and progress. But what else could cultural institutions across the world be doing to promote gender equality? Please add your voice to the discussion below.

And, more than that, it was actually a rugged, all-terrain vehicle that hooked up to your bike or cruised up and down mountains. The original idea for the Bugaboo was conceived in 1994, when its Dutch creator, Max Barenbrug \u2013 then a design student in Amsterdam looking for an idea for his graduation project \u2013 saw that parents were having problems getting their children from their bike-carriers into pushchairs. From his second-floor vantage point, with a designer&apos;s eye, he noticed two things. First, the functionality of existing pushchairs was poor. But also, that they were conservative \u2013 blue for boys, pink for girls \u2013 clunky and not very interesting. &quot;It was such a hassle for these parents, that I thought I had to come up to something that would solve that problem for them,&quot; he says. &quot;So I designed a product where you could transform a stroller from four to two wheels, you could pull the seat up above the bike rack and then connect the two together.&quot; &quot;My original design was for men,&quot; he explains. &quot;It was actually inspired by my teacher at the design academy, who was trying to make a more feminine car \u2013 remember the Twingo? \u2013 because at that time everything was extremely tough and meant for men. That trend was not that good for the car business. But for the stroller business, where everything was very feminine, the opposite was actually quite a good idea.&quot; Quite a good idea indeed: revenue in 2011 (the last year available) was \u20ac82m (\u00a370m). The company now has eight offices, employs more than 900 people and sells to 46 countries. Success, though, didn&apos;t happen overnight. When Barenbrug finished his degree and tried to sell his design, no one was interested. &quot;It was quite funny,&quot; he says. &quot;I graduated with honours, got a lot of publicity, but the industry was just not interested. At that time they were even more conservative than they are today. Now they have adopted our design \u2013 they were forced to, really, otherwise we&apos;d probably sell our product all over the place. But back then they didn&apos;t want this new revolutionary design.&quot; So Barenbrug tinkered and tweaked. Put in softer fabrics. Made it less a device to attach to a push-bike and more a straightforward baby stroller with swivel-wheels and a handle more appropriate for tall Dutch men. Straightforward in outline, that is \u2013 not in design. Barenbrug is clearly, even by designer standards, obsessed with details. It&apos;s no coincidence that Bugaboo, despite its success, has actually produced very few models by the standards of its competitors. It has also resisted the temptation to branch out into the many other arms of the baby-paraphernalia market. Not for it the travel cot, the high chair, the mobiles. This is because unless you can truly reinvent it, Barenbrug just isn&apos;t interested: he describes such products, design-wise, as &quot;boring&quot;. Back in 1997, though, he really did seem to have reinvented the all-terrain wheel. &quot;We had this fantastic success at the Cologne Fair,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Everyone who had rejected the previous design suddenly were standing in line to buy us out. That was what I&apos;ve learned as well. If you show a concept, people say, &apos;Uh huh?&apos;; but if you show them a real product then they start understanding. Really funny, people cannot think from paper.&quot; In 1999 the product hit the market \u2013 though only after, frustrated by poor-quality parts (and horrified by working conditions they saw elsewhere) Barenbrug and his partner Eduard Zanen had built their own factory in Taiwan. Barenbrug even designed the production line. The first stroller, the Frog, launched in the UK in 2003, but 2004 proved the tipping point. When Paltrow was photographed with the Bugaboo Frog on the streets of New York, sales exploded. Quickly, the Bugaboo became a fashion trend, a status symbol. For a brand that prizes its high-tech Dutch engineering and usability, does that not prove something of a mixed blessing? &quot;It frustrates me a bit,&quot; Barenbrug concedes. &quot;From the sales-figures perspective I don&apos;t mind at all, of course, but unfortunately it means people don&apos;t understand the product and its features completely.&quot; He elaborates. &quot;Today, many competitors do come close to us, design-wise \u2013 and I mean only the looks \u2013 so if the consumer judges the product only superficially, then it could be to your disadvantage. Because then they just look at the looks then buy your competitor instead of you.&quot; You suspect he&apos;s speaking mainly of iCandy \u2013 frequently referred to as &quot;the new Bugaboo&quot; \u2013 which launched in 2005; and another brand that now goes hand-in-handle with the designer changing bag and attendant lifestyle.     The Missoni design for Bugaboo.    It&apos;s an odd and slightly awkward position to inhabit \u2013 speaking to Barenbrug it&apos;s clear that he cares only about design and functionality \u2013 yet the company has collaborated with with Missoni and Marc Jacobs, which hardly underplay the celebrity angle. When it recently launched the Bugaboo Donkey, with its \u00a31,000 price tag, there was a considerable backlash \u2013 horror at the price, probably exacerbated by the perception that price reflected a sort of &quot;designer-label&quot; ethos. Yet the product really was a genuine innovation (a two-seater that converts to a one-seater, and vice versa), which is likely to spawn copies further down the road. Barenbrug is also irritated by people failing to see \u2013 or use \u2013 the stroller&apos;s true functionality: &quot;You can do a lot of things with this product,&quot; he insists. &quot;It is rugged and versatile enough to go into the mountains, to the beach and you can take the seat out, put it on your back, do something different.&quot; He thinks the backlash reflects this \u2013 if you don&apos;t use what your hefty outlay bought you, why wouldn&apos;t you be frustrated? Actual reviews, most importantly, remain very strong. The consumer company Which has the brand top of its &quot;best pushchair brands&quot; leaderboard, with an average score of 78% (iCandy gets 73%, Maclaren 63%) and rates all four models that it has tested as &quot;best buys&quot;. The Mumsnet community rates them highly too, with user-generated reviews averaging four out of five stars for all models bar the Chameleon3, which gets five. And now the Duchess of Cambridge has bought one \u2013 that&apos;s not merely a celebrity seal of approval but a royal one. So what next for the man who made pushchairs into a status symbol, even if he did it inadvertently? It turns out that Bugaboo may have a surprise up its sleeve. &quot;We have a new innovation that&apos;s got nothing to do with a stroller,&quot; says Barenbrug. &quot;It&apos;s a totally new business where the term mobility is written with a capital. Mobility really is the issue. It will really make the difference, like we did for strollers. Unfortunately I can&apos;t really talk about it.&quot; An intriguing prospect, then, and one that may see another highly coveted, highly fashionable Bugaboo product on our streets.", "sentences": ["The original idea for the Bugaboo was conceived in 1994, when its Dutch creator, Max Barenbrug \u2013 then a design student in Amsterdam looking for an idea for his graduation project \u2013 saw that parents were having problems getting their children from their bike-carriers into pushchairs."], "title": "Bugaboo designer Max Barenbrug: the master of reinvention", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/23/bugaboo-designer-max-barenbrug-buggy", "tags": ["Parents and parenting", "Family", "Life and style", "Design", "Art and design", "Retail industry", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-05-23T13:02:49Z", "article": "The boss of Flybe has hit out at &quot;punitive&quot; charges and taxes that have pushed the troubled regional airline to end flights in and out of London from next March.

What&apos;s your greatest running achievement? I&apos;d say being double European indoor champion in the 400m in the European Championship just gone. That was a great achievement for me because it wasn&apos;t my usual event. I&apos;m a 400m hurdler. So to have won an individual race ... plus we also won the 4x4 relay. Even though I&apos;ve been to the Olympics, I would still say the European because I got a medal. It felt brilliant. When someone asks for a training tip, what do you tell them? Be prepared to train hard; there are no shortcuts. Put 100% into it because hard work pays off and what you put into it you will get back out.  Do you like a running gadget? If so, what&apos;s your favourite? I use the Nike FuelBand. People don&apos;t really realise what&apos;s on your wrist, they are like: &quot;What&apos;s that bracelet?&quot; But there is a lot that it does, in terms of tracking the amount of steps and calories that I&apos;ve done. A lot of athletes I know use them.  Do you run to music? What do you listen to? Yes, especially to warm up before a race. It gets me into the zone and psychs me up. I don&apos;t have a particular playlist. I just let my iPod play on shuffle. I have a range of stuff on there \u2013 house, garage, basement, R&amp;B \u2013 both current and old. Where is your favourite place to run and why? I love racing around the world but also at home. I&apos;ve got really good memories of the Alexander stadium in Birmingham. I tend to perform really well there.  What&apos;s your favourite post-race indulgence? It gets boring being healthy all of the time but I will treat myself sometimes. I love cake and custard and sweets but not chocolate \u2013 although if you gave me a Ferrero Rocher, I wouldn&apos;t say no. I eat a lot of energy bars and nuts like almonds and cashews. What is the worst thing about running? When it comes to going to the physio, people think you are going to have a massage and it&apos;s really nice. It&apos;s not at all; it&apos;s extremely painful. It has to be done, though, as it&apos;s part of your recovery. What do you eat on the morning of a race? The week before, I carb up with pasta, potatoes and rice. Then on the morning of a race I always, without a doubt, have porridge with nutmeg and a smoothie with vegetables in it, because I don&apos;t like eating them otherwise.  What&apos;s the furthest distance you&apos;ve ever run? 5k. It was tough. When I come to the end of my athletics career as a sprinter, I would love to do a marathon - or the We Own the Night 10km race! [We interviewed Perri just before she acted as starter for this race]. But it would not benefit me doing longer distances now. Do you ever run barefoot?  The closest I get to barefoot is when I&apos;m wearing my Nike Frees.

He also cited the dire need for sustainability reporting to address planetary boundaries, such as climate change. G4 clearly continues the multi-decade move out of blindness by further enhancing our sight. Unfortunately, the newly-minted guidelines missed a major opportunity to solidify its status. What&apos;s particularly frustrating is that GRI already has the lens needed to clarify our vision.

But the new framework provides no further guidance on how to enact this principle, thereby retaining a fatal flaw, as few companies actually report their sustainability performance in this context. This outcome was altogether avoidable. Last September, the Sustainability Context Group submitted a public comment letter urging GRI to provide the guidance necessary for reporting organisations to implement the principle. Signed by 66 global thought leaders and practitioners the letter went so far as to suggest functional specifications that GRI could cut and paste into G4, or use as a starting point for drafting its own articulation. The group, which Mark McElroy and I cofounded in early 2012, chose this strategy to avoid being too prescriptive. In other words, we&apos;re not asking GRI to determine specific planetary boundaries or social foundation thresholds, but rather to explain how to make such determinations. We then provided illustrative examples of practice in areas such as carbon and water, citing work such as BT&apos;s climate stabilisation intensity methodology, Autodesk&apos;s C-FACT (Corporate Finance Approach to Climate Stabilising Targets) and EMC. What makes this omission more confounding is the degree to which GRI and its partners profess the need for companies to address their accountability for contributing to (and helping solve) environmental and social problems. UNEP executive director, Achim Steiner, echoed King&apos;s call to address planetary boundaries. Current GRI board chair, Herman Mulder, discussed ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss and UN Global Compact executive director, Georg Kell, bemoaned the 400ppm atmospheric carbon concentration our world just reached, well beyond the 350 threshold scientists say we must achieve to stabilise our climate. Luckily, other players in the corporate sustainability ecosystem are exhibiting both sight and vision. The Global Initiative for Sustainability Ratings just embraced Sustainability Context in its Beta Principles. Climate Counts, a non-profit third party rater of corporate climate performance, is conducting a pilot project taking a context-based approach to assessing company carbon emissions. And the World Business Council for Sustainable Development partnered with the Stockholm Resilience Center to integrate planetary boundaries into its Vision 2050 agenda. On the other hand, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (on whose Advisory Council I serve) has explicitly rejected embracing a context-based approach &quot;at this time.&quot; The jury is still out on the International Integrated Reporting Council framework, though its Consultation Draft takes a multiple capitals approach that takes accountability for company impacts on shared capitals that may align with a context-based approach. Events at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on the morning of the G4 launch weirdly foreshadowed GRI&apos;s shift from visionary status. After Mulder banged the gong opening the trading day, Anne Louise van Lynden of NYSE Euronext presented him with a tombstone plaque and a bronze coin of Mercurius, patron saint of trade, thieves, and boundaries. What&apos;s the symbolism? How does Mercury feel about the G4&apos;s (mis)handling of planetary boundaries? And what&apos;s up with the tombstone \u2013 is GRI whistling past the graveyard? Or is there still an opportunity for GRI to finally provide guidance on how to do sustainability context and recapture its visionary status? This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

But it lives on thanks to a professor of philosophy who survived Theresienstadt concentration camp, where it was written, and who preserved the manuscript. Now a Berlin orchestra and an American conductor are to revive The Emperor of Atlantis by Czech-German composer Viktor Ullmann on a more than unusual stage \u2013 the former headquarters of the SS and Gestapo in the German capital, known as the Topography of Terror. &quot;We wanted to reinforce the immediacy of the genocide of Ullmann and whole schools of composers of that time and this is a far more effective mise en sc\u00e8ne than an opera house would be,&quot; said John Axelrod, the US conductor who is leading the project. Ullmann, who was Jewish and had been a pupil of the Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg, wrote the operatic satire on Adolf Hitler knowing full well that it would lead to his death. The nature of its contents was not lost on the SS authorities of Theresienstadt, who soon after the final rehearsal of the work, in March 1944, deported Ullmann to Auschwitz, along with his librettist, Peter Kien, where he was murdered on 18 October aged 46. &quot;Ullmann clearly set out to make an anti-Nazi piece, in which art should hold up a mirror to what the Nazis were doing,&quot; said Axelrod, in between rehearsals with the musicians from the Kammersymphonie Berlin. The one-hour opera is an energetic mix of jazzy interludes, touches of cabaret, Bach-style chorales and sweet lyricism. It serves, according to Axelrod, as a bittersweet tribute to the long lineup of musicians whose murder or expulsion from Europe &quot;destroyed much of the continent&apos;s musical legacy&quot;. He points to the direct cribbing in Ullmann&apos;s opera of many of the works of the great composers of the German-speaking world who were either classified as degenerate because of their Jewishness by the Nazis and their music banned \u2013 as was the case with Mahler, Mendelssohn and Weill \u2013 or whose music was commandeered for propaganda purposes, such as Brahms or Wagner. &quot;He&apos;s using the opera to ask, what happened to German enlightenment and its key ideal, all people become brothers?&quot; Like many musicians, Ullmann, who was considered one of the leading composers of his day, was sent to Theresienstadt in what is now the Czech Republic. The concentration camp was presented to the outside world as a pristine model fortress town whose &quot;inhabitants&quot; \u2013 so Nazi authorities were keen to show \u2013 were treated decently, to the extent that they were able to carry on their musical, acting or artistic careers. In reality tens of thousands were murdered there and for more than 150,000 others it was a holding camp from which they were taken by rail transport to death camps elsewhere. At a rehearsal this week on Friday, the somewhat unusual array of instruments in the orchestra, including a guitar, banjo and saxophone, poignantly reflected the fact that Ullmann had to write his opera around whatever musicians were available to him in the camp.  Despite his musical prominence in his lifetime, most of Ullmann&apos;s music was lost during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. That The Emperor of Atlantis survives at all is thanks to Emil Utiz, a Prague professor who was Theresienstadt&apos;s librarian and took the score out of the camp when it was liberated. It was first performed in Amsterdam in 1975, parts of it having been lightly edited after a spiritualist who claimed she could contact dead composers said she had received communication of the changes directly from Ullmann. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 May 2013.

In 2011, when the Stone Roses announced that they would be reforming to play some gigs \u2013 Ian Brown, John Squire, Gary &quot;Mani&quot; Mounfield and Alan &quot;Reni&quot; Wren together onstage, 15 years after their rancorous split \u2013 many, many music fans appeared to go completely insane. Grown men wept, danced, hugged, clambered into the loft to find their Reni hat, pointed both hands to the sky for the chorus of I Am the Resurrection, then wept again. The internet exploded with delight. Oasis&apos;s Liam Gallagher tweeted &quot;not been this happy since my kids were born&quot; and thousands agreed. Of course, there were cynics; but they were silenced when all 150,000 tickets for the Roses&apos; Manchester Heaton Park gigs last year were bought in 14 minutes. The band added another Heaton Park show. That too, sold out: 220,000 tickets sold in 68 minutes. And this year, when tickets went on sale for the first cinema showing of Made of Stone, the feature-length documentary about the band&apos;s reformation, they were snapped up in 60 seconds flat. What is it about this band \u2013 these four middle-aged Mancs, these fathers in trainers and shaggy dos, with their laughter lines and sarky comments and reluctance to play the media game \u2013 that inspires such passion? It&apos;s not just their music, although their first album, The Stone Roses, seems to grow more beautiful as the years go by: wistful harmonies and stunning, seemingly effortless musical ability combining to create a timeless, still-fresh classic. It&apos;s not just their cocksure, funny attitude, though that definitely adds to their charisma. Perhaps it&apos;s something to do with the band&apos;s fragility, that failure to deliver. Their back catalogue is minimal, their career a depressing tale of squandered talent, dodgy contracts, amateurish management, chemical excess. Other well-loved bands \u2013 the Smiths, Oasis \u2013 managed at least four albums before everything went nasty. The Stone Roses made two, with five-and-a-half years between them; and the second one broke their spirit, along with that of three producers. They never made it in America; they never achieved their potential. Is that why they&apos;re still so worshipped? This is not a rhetorical question. I am asking it of Shane Meadows, 40, director of Made of Stone, a film almost as breathlessly anticipated as the reunion itself. He hears me out patiently, but thinks it&apos;s something else. &quot;If you attach yourself to certain people at a certain point in your life, they never become human again, they&apos;re always gods,&quot; he says. &quot;The Stone Roses are like that for me.&quot; Meadows didn&apos;t expect to direct Made of Stone. When, in 2011, he got a\u00a0phone call from Ian Brown, he thought Brown might be ringing about\u00a0making a video for his solo single. But instead, the singer told him\u00a0that the Roses were reforming. &quot;And my head exploded,&quot; he says. &quot;I started hyperventilating. Not because I thought I&apos;d be doing anything with them, but because my dreams were coming true, I could go and actually see them play live. I&apos;d never seen the Roses play. I&apos;d given away my Spike Island ticket as a kid and then I&apos;d given up on it happening. And then Ian said something about &apos;We&apos;re doing this press conference and we wanted to document it&apos;, and I started to twig, and I said: &apos;Look, if you are thinking about making a film and you let anyone else do it, I will kill myself. So you&apos;re going to have to let me do it.&apos;&quot; I&apos;ve interviewed Shane Meadows before, about his brilliant, award-winning films and TV series (This Is England, Dead Man&apos;s Shoes, A Room for Romeo Brass), about his ability to capture emotion on camera (he ignores the gripes of the film crew, concentrates on the actors), about his mistakes (using an enormous, energetically kicking baby to play a newborn), about what he finds funny (Paddy Considine). But this interview is different. This is an interview with Shane Meadows, Stone Roses fan. We talk for over an hour, in an arts centre cafe on Nottingham&apos;s university campus and at no point do we stop discussing the Roses. It&apos;s understandable: Meadows has been immersed in Made of Stone since Brown&apos;s 2011 phone call, and his head is still there. He was tweaking the film right up until the very last moment. The press showing was in London on 8 May at 6.30pm; Meadows handed the finished tape to the projectionist at 5.50pm. I assumed that his final cut was taking so long because the band were demanding last-minute alterations, but\u00a0Meadows says no. He asked for, and got, ultimate approval: the band had very few rules, the most limiting for Meadows being that they wouldn&apos;t do any\u00a0sit-down interviews. (This means that the interviews heard in the film are all archive; the Roses today just offer quips to the camera.) Other than that, their only requests were to put stuff in: &quot;John would email me photographs, a relative would come up\u00a0with some old video footage.&quot; Meadows didn&apos;t have a master plan for the film \u2013 no storyboards, no prepared narrative \u2013 and he made that clear from the off. This was probably wise: like so much around the Roses, there was a sense that everything might fall apart at any minute. You can see this when, in the middle of the European tour, the run-up to the Heaton Park gigs, Reni quits the band, finishing the set but refusing to come back onstage for an encore. Ian Brown explains to the 5,000-strong audience that &quot;the drummer&apos;s a cunt&quot;, as they scream abuse at him. Love curdles in an instant. The reason the band refused interviews was because they didn&apos;t want to talk about why they split up the first time around. &quot;They&apos;d only just got over it and got back together in the same room,&quot; says Meadows. &quot;Once they shook hands and got on with it, it was never talked about.&quot; When Reni walked, Meadows switched the camera off: &quot;The band were more important to me than getting a Michael Moore expos\u00e9.&quot; There&apos;s one shot of the band looking miserable in an airport, but otherwise, that&apos;s it. Anyone who&apos;s searching for the definitive explanation as to why Reni left in 2012, let alone why he left in 1995, or why Squire quit a year later, won&apos;t get it from Made of Stone. There\u00a0are hints \u2013 bad sound in Amsterdam, Brown and Reni arguing during Second Coming, what Mani calls &quot;the loss of momentum&quot;, Reni&apos;s disdain for fame \u2013 but nothing concrete. Did he want to pry more? &quot;I think all human beings have this instinctive nosiness, where you would love to find out what went on,&quot; says Meadows. &quot;And like a lot of Stone Roses fans, I sort of did, but I sort of didn&apos;t. Things are hinted at, and you get a sense through people&apos;s voices, but all the interviews are from different times before they got back together, so\u00a0it&apos;s not definitive. I like that, it gives the film texture. We live in a culture where we get given everything, as soon as we want it. So in a way, it&apos;s really nice to say to people: &apos;No, you&apos;re not having that.&apos; Because ultimately when you give people the intimate stuff they want, they consume it and they spit it out. No\u00a0one actually cares.&quot; During the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Meadows was living in Uttoxeter, near Stoke, he would go to Madchester nights at the local town hall. The DJ played the Charlatans, the Wedding Present, Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses: everything was much of a muchness, though the Roses were acknowledged as the daddies of the scene. Shane, who started receding at 17, still managed to grow a Madchester wedge, which he dyed blond and combined with a moustache: &quot;We were coming out of that sports, trackie phase, what can I say?&quot; He wore red dungarees, which faded to pink over multiple washes; also a poncho with an Aztec symbol on the front, which his friend bought for him at Affleck&apos;s Palace in Manchester. Only 40 minutes away from Uttoxeter, &quot;but it might as well have been 1,000 miles away&quot;. The Stone Roses meant more to Meadows than other bands: at college, he met a girl who was an art student \u2013 &quot;the first girl I went out with that wasn&apos;t a hairdresser&quot; \u2013 and when he first got off with her, Waterfall was playing in the background. &quot;I thought, this is the life!&quot; He and his friends bought tickets for the Roses&apos; Spike Island gig, but the night before, Meadows took acid and everything went bad. Almost immediately, he could tell that his evening wasn&apos;t going to be pleasant, and went to the pub toilet to make himself throw up. But it was no good: 12 hours of living hell followed, culminating in Meadows finding himself at a bonfire by a river &quot;with a load of goths&quot;. He looked at his Spike Island ticket and thought: &quot;There&apos;ll be 30,000 people there tomorrow, I&apos;m going to get stabbed.&quot; So he gave it away. The next day all his friends went without him. And that was that. There&apos;s a section in Made of Stone that is based around the Stone Roses&apos; surprise warm-up gig at Parr Hall in Warrington, near Manchester. It&apos;s announced at 4pm that the band will be playing that evening and that tickets are free to the first 1,000 people who turn up with something that shows they&apos;re a fan: an album, an old T-shirt, a ticket to the Heaton Park gig. You see people running, queuing, getting in; being kept out, left standing by the barriers. There are some beautiful impromptu speeches by the Warrington fans, who are mostly middle-aged and manic in their devotion. One says: &quot;There&apos;s a reason why I&apos;ve still got my hair like this, there&apos;s a reason why I&apos;ve never worn a tie, there&apos;s a reason why I listen to that album at least once a week and it still makes me tingle.&quot; Another, post-gig: &quot;You know when you get an album and you play it when you have a great time, you play it when people pass on, when you get married, when your kids are born\u2026 It makes you feel good that further down the line, things come good.&quot; Meadows loves these homilies, thinks he couldn&apos;t have written them better himself. Actually, the Warrington section is the part of the film that is most like his others. &quot;Kitchen sink&quot; he calls his style, though his films are funnier and more contemporary than that. Meadows is great at finding the heart in people, showing us the emotion that drives the most everyday of lives.     The Stone Roses' Ian Brown and John Squire at Heaton Park in 2012. Photograph: Dean Rogers    Warrington is also the very first time that Meadows himself sees the Roses play live: he tells us this as they walk on stage, and you can feel his nerves and excitement. Watching the gig, you remember another reason why the Stone Roses mean so much to so many. Their concerts are the audience&apos;s too: the crowd take over, sing along to every word. Critics always made much of the fact that Ian Brown&apos;s voice is weak \u2013 and in Parr Hall he is off-key \u2013 but it simply doesn&apos;t matter. &quot;Everybody is a star&quot; is a Roses mantra, and, at their best gigs, everybody is. Warrington is one of those. It was Warrington that really made Meadows think he had a movie. He was wary of making what he calls &quot;one of those BBC documentaries&quot;, where everything is filmed from the back of a room and nothing is filmic, epic or strange. So, in the final part of Made of Stone, when we see the band play Heaton Park, Meadows drops out the sound of the crowd altogether, leaving us to appreciate an extended, psychedelic version of Fool&apos;s Gold, marvel at the musicianship of John Squire, Mani and Reni. Near the beginning, he films a rehearsal in black and white, with a camera close up on each band member: we witness that intense, more-than-the-sum connection that sometimes comes when four people create music together. It makes me think of the Roses&apos; reunion press conference when Mani said: &quot;When bands play together, that unseen member comes in and there&apos;s something happening musically, it&apos;s magical.&quot; But the shot that makes Made of Stone is the opening one. Filmed by Laurie Rose (no relation), the film&apos;s director of photography, it pans the front row of the fans at Heaton Park as Ian Brown moves along, slapping outstretched hands. You see the fans&apos; wild, transported faces, screaming; you see Brown&apos;s \u2013 his geometric cheekbones, unfathomable eyes. He takes someone&apos;s mobile phone, films himself and the crowd, gives it back. All in one unbroken, slo-mo shot. And over the top, we hear Alfred Hitchcock, of all people, talking about creativity. It&apos;s mesmeric. &quot;When I saw that shot it was the closest thing I felt to when I&apos;m making a drama,&quot; says Meadows. &quot;When you&apos;re watching it and having palpitations because it&apos;s so good and you&apos;re just thinking, &apos;Get to the end! Get to the end without anyone making a mistake!&apos; I spent ages looking for a scientist talking about volatility in scientific elements to put over it, but I couldn&apos;t find anything. The Hitchcock thing just felt right: it says we&apos;re not going to shy away from the fact that this is a complex animal, we&apos;re not going to smack you on the nose in a cheesy way. It has its own mojo and it stops people thinking, Oh, it&apos;s Shane Meadows, we&apos;re going to be driving around in the back of a van.&quot; Meadows is funny about what he sees as his limitations as a film-maker, almost always caused by lack of budget: &quot;I&apos;ve never filmed anything that hasn&apos;t had restrictions put on what I want to do.&quot; But now he&apos;s made Made of Stone, which required an enormous film crew, with cameras on each band member, on the crowd, on the overall scene, he feels differently. His next two projects are the final part of the This Is England series, This Is England &apos;90 (shades of the pink dungaree years: ages ago, he told me this would open with someone putting an ecstasy tablet on their tongue); and the story of cyclist Tommy Simpson, the first Briton ever to wear the yellow jersey, who died cycling up Mont Ventoux. The Simpson story requires re-creating and filming the Tour de France in the 1960s, a tricky challenge, &quot;but I&apos;m not scared of it any more,&quot; he says. &quot;If I wanted to make a film about a medieval king and a war, I feel like I could now, because I&apos;ve had 35 cameras at one gig. I don&apos;t always have to film people in flats getting knocked about.&quot; For now, though, after the film premiere, Meadows is going to take some time off. &quot;Weld the car, play Lego with my boys, paint the house.&quot; He is relieved; not just because he&apos;ll be spending time with his family but because, despite his nerves, despite the will-they-won&apos;t-they nature of the Roses, Made of Stone has been a happy experience. &quot;They always say don&apos;t meet your heroes, don&apos;t they? And I was worried because the Roses are cool; they take a lot in their stride and I never was cool. I had that needy desire, wanting them to love me, what if they didn&apos;t like me, told me to go\u2026? But I kept thinking, well, even if the film doesn&apos;t happen, it was worth it because of this. Like I saw them play Bye Bye Badman in rehearsal, me sitting on the sofa next to Ian Brown, and my heart was thumping so hard, I nearly had a heart attack. I filmed them playing Waterfall in rehearsal. I went to Warrington and saw them play live for the first time ever\u2026 &quot;And the risk was that I would damage my dream, working so closely with them, or that I would get complacent about their music. But if anything, I&apos;ve fallen in love with them and their music even more.

The online series, Dropped, is part of the latest stage of Heineken&apos;s global multimillion-pound ad campaign which continues with a new TV ad, The Voyage. Heineken described Dropped as a &quot;social experiment&quot;, with members of the public encouraged to live outside their boundaries and cope with unusual experiences, like the protagonist in The Voyage TV commercials. Participants will be dropped in remote locations with just flimsy supplies and directions, and have to make their way to a destination encountering &quot;certain engineered situations&quot;, such as strange locals or possibly useful objects. The idea appears to loosely resemble the madcap, unpredictable situations experienced by the &quot;wolfpack&quot; in the Hangover trilogy, crossed with Bear Grylls&apos; point-to-point survival journeys. Heineken is planning a string of Dropped shows, which will be filmed documentary-style charting the men&apos;s progress and will run as three episodes on a YouTube channel. The first episode, which features a man who dislikes the cold dropped in the wastes of Alaska, will be available online from 3 June. &quot;We want to go further than inspiring men to be resourceful and open to the world,&quot; said the Heineken global communications director, Sandrine Huijgen. &quot;We are giving a few of them the opportunity to go beyond the borders of their comfort zone. Dropped is a social experiment that will challenge the participant to display their true character and if they do, have a legendary travel experience.&quot; Members of the public will be able to upload videos of their version of a &quot;legendary take on an everyday journey&quot; \u2013 which sounds a little bit like opening the can on a Jackass meets Channel 4&apos;s Rude Tube online portal \u2013 with a winner chosen to feature in their own Heineken Dropped adventure. The aim of the new Voyage TV ad, which has been created by Wieden &amp; Kennedy Amsterdam, is to inspire Heineken drinkers to be travellers, not tourists. Voyage is the fifth in a series of ads called Legends which sees the protagonist suavely dealing with bizarre and surreal experiences, including a tie-up with James Bond&apos;s Skyfall film which saw him dodging villains and sharing a beer with 007 actor Daniel Craig. \u2022\u00a0To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

The eruption of frustration with Erdogan&apos;s government spread to a dozen other Turkish cities overnight and supporters gathered worldwide in Boston, London, Barcelona and Amsterdam to voice solidarity with the protesters. Police eventually withdrew from the city&apos;s central Taksim Square early on Saturday evening, bringing an end to the clashes.

Celebrations united many factions of Turkish society \u2013 leftist groups, unions, nationalists, Kemalists and members of the gay and transgender communities waving rainbow flags. &quot;This is just the beginning, our struggle will continue!&quot; chanted a euphoric crowd. The original protest was aimed at saving a city centre park in Istanbul from shopping centre developers who had been backed by the government. But it rapidly snowballed into a national display of anger at the perceived arrogance of the country&apos;s rulers. While the ferocity of Friday&apos;s police crackdown attracted worldwide headlines, the mass protests against the government went largely unreported on the main Turkish TV channels and government-supporting newspapers. Erdogan, usually quick to respond to major events, also remained silent until Saturday, when he delivered a lengthy address on television. Calling for an immediate end to the protests, he pledged that the government would press ahead with the construction of the controversial shopping centre. &quot;Police were there yesterday, they&apos;ll be on duty today and also tomorrow because Taksim Square cannot be an area where extremists are running wild,&quot; Erdogan said. &quot;If this is about staging a protest, about a social movement, I would \u2026 gather 200,000 where they gather 20, and where they gather 100,000, I would gather 1 million party supporters. Let&apos;s not go down that road.&quot; Sirri Sureyya Onder, an MP from the Kurdish Peace and Democracy party (BDP), who was injured by a teargas cartridge on Saturday, said the government had gone too far in its crackdown on peaceful protesters. &quot;They are rebelling against all of this now. People are fed up with this lack of public discussion, with the disrespect, the immoderateness, the lawlessness and the authoritarianism of this government. It is not very good at apologising. But this time I think it will have to.&quot; The lack of media coverage has further inflamed tension on the streets. &quot;There is a total media blackout on this in Turkey, the Turkish media silent on the protests; they all collaborate with the government,&quot; said 21-year-old student Ayse Sarac. &quot;We follow the foreign news coverage to get more information.&quot; On Saturday many shop owners, hotels and residents of Istanbul&apos;s Beyoglu district showed solidarity with demonstrators, handing out water and offering shelter to those fleeing the police raids. Volunteer doctors and medical students set up makeshift clinics all over the chic central district. From a small bar just off Taksim Square, 30-year-old bar manager Esra Huri Bulduk and other activists handed out bottles of milk and anti-acidic fluids used to counter the effects of teargas. A room in the Istanbul Chamber of Mechanical Engineers was transformed into an impromptu clinic. Up to 15 doctors have been treating victims of teargas attacks and police violence since Friday night. &quot;We have treated more than 100 patients here,&quot; said one medical student who wished to remain anonymous. &quot;The police now use a very heavy teargas that causes serious health problems.&quot; Hundreds have sustained injuries over the past two days, some serious, with at least three people said to be in critical condition. There are reports of head trauma and broken limbs. Human Rights Watch confirmed that one 23-year-old student lost an eye after being hit with a plastic bullet by police. &quot;This excessive violence once again shows that this government is intolerant of dissent and restrictive of dissent,&quot; said Emma Sinclair-Webb, senior Turkey researcher at Human Rights Watch. &quot;But this is a new low, even for Turkey.&quot; The US has expressed concern over the way the Turkish government is handling the situation, and the British consulate in Istanbul took the unusual step of publicly rebuking the government for overreacting after a teargas canister landed in the consulate gardens. &quot;Our government actively supports the Syrian opposition, and they constantly call for more democratic rights in Syria. But look what they do to those who oppose their own ideas and policies \u2013 they try to shut us up with teargas and violence,&quot; said Nejla Gulten, a 32-year-old sociologist. &quot;When the prime minister speaks about women, he never speaks about the problem of violence against women, but only about how many children we should have. He shapes every issue in Turkey to suit himself.&quot;", "sentences": ["The eruption of frustration with Erdogan&apos;s government spread to a dozen other Turkish cities overnight and supporters gathered worldwide in Boston, London, Barcelona and Amsterdam to voice solidarity with the protesters."], "title": "Turkish protest takes root in Istanbul square after security forces withdraw", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/01/turkey-istanbul-erdogan-demo-protests", "tags": ["Turkey", "World news", "Protest", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan", "Middle East and North Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-06-03T08:58:00Z", "article": "Between us, we have more than 9,000 followers on Twitter, which made us rather unique in the BSR Social Media and Reporting session during last week&apos;s GRI Conference in Amsterdam. In a room of 20 people, there were only three other members of the Twitterati. That&apos;s the first lesson from our session \u2013 a worrying number of reporting professionals in leading GRI companies aren&apos;t personally involved in the wide and growing universe of social media. From the plenary stage to chats over cups of coffee, there have been great debates over integrated reporting, the coming together of financial and sustainability reporting, but an almost total lack of discussion about how sustainability reporting will come into sync with the way most people actually seek out, share and produce information. Those worlds must integrate. As Aron tweeted, &quot;Will social media have the same impact on sustainability reporting as it has on newspapers?&quot; And as Soli asked, &quot;How can we fill the gulf between 140-page PDF report and 140-character tweet?&quot; What&apos;s the relationship between social media and sustainability reporting? When was the last time you checked a printed phone book? Data and information search have already moved online, and reporting will also undergo this inevitable transition \u2013 the only question is when. The data suggest that this transition is happening slowly, but beginning to accelerate. As the SMI Wizness Survey shows, in 2010 only 60 major businesses had social media activity around sustainability; in 2012 that hit the 176 mark. The real value of social media is engagement. Too many traditional reports are unread, un-challenged and therefore simply invisible. Social media conversations are alive, human and engaging discussions among peers. The &quot;s&quot; word (&quot;sustainability&quot;) might not trend on Twitter often, but there is a lively debate happening 24/7, with informal sustainability communities discussing events such as the terrible garment factory collapse in Bangladesh and ideas like what to do about &quot;unburnable carbon&quot;. These are often far more interesting than the somewhat static information provided in reports. The conversations are happening and, to be blunt, more people are actually participating in them than is the case with most sustainability reports. Isn&apos;t social media just gossip and opinion? Social media is human. It sounds like we really sound. That&apos;s why there is so much intense debate, sharp opinion, and sometimes reactionary gossip on Twitter, Facebook, Vine, and other leading social media platforms. Sustainability reports, with their data, official letters, and assurance statements play the uptight grandparent to social media&apos;s unruly teenager. These formal data are immensely important, but they will lose relevance \u2013 and audience \u2013 if they don&apos;t wake up and live. They need to be brought out of the vine-covered castles of corporate websites. Regard your report as a repository. The repository itself isn&apos;t often used, but the fascinating, unique and relevant data within it can be used in the social media debate. So what should reporters actually do? In the early days of the internet, companies responded by simply publishing PDFs online. That failed to capture the fundamentally new opportunity and way of communicating on the web, and a similar approach to social media is equally uninspired. Instead, we need to think in entirely new ways about information shared and debated via social media. \u2022 Be human \u2013 give your sustainability data a face. Invite eagerly tweeting colleagues to use sustainability reporting in their engagements. Social media may mean that individuals rather than institutions have the main voice \u2022 Listen \u2013 the right balance should be &quot;99% listen and 1% talk&quot; on social media. This is an incredible source for insight, early warning, new debates, ideas and likely responses from the whole stakeholder world. \u2022 Be quick \u2013 you may not yet have achieved live reporting, but you can (in fact, you already do) have live social media. If relevant conversations are online, join in. Use your proof and reporting evidence in live debates. \u2022 Join up \u2013 build communities and join communities. From sustainability hashtags to LinkedIn groups there are millions of interested stakeholders already online. Go where they already are. \u2022 Integrate \u2013 make every proof point in your report usable on social media \u2013 add the buttons. Create &quot;magazine-style&quot; reports with comments on every page. Run debates on social media around your material issues. Translate your data into pictures, videos, snippets, blogs, contacts and posts. What will happen next? Social media could either be the deathknell of reporting or the best thing ever to happen to it. For this story to have a happy ending (told, no doubt in 140 characters or a six-second video on Vine), reporting will have to adapt rapidly. Today, companies still exert control over reports that are largely one-way conversations. Tomorrow, companies may instead curate discussions by uploading all their raw data with their perspectives, and then invite the hacktavist community to play with it and the communities on social media to analyse and debate it, and create a living document that provides real insight. If this dynamic model takes hold, the question &quot;who actually reads these reports anyway&quot; will vanish, just like the phone book. So we ask: which company will be first to embrace the new model by posting the first wiki-report? Or will someone be doing it for you?

All those siege resistant walls, impregnable castles and towering cathedrals to build. Life is somewhat different today. For your average urban planner, plotting the drainage system and rooting the traffic lights are more probable pursuits. In Ron van der Lans&apos; case, it is parking spaces that keep him busy. Boring, you&apos;d think. Not so. In fact, the Dutch data systems&apos; expert is positively exuberant on the subject. He has good reason. As senior director at the Amsterdam Economic Board, a non-profit foundation, he&apos;s involved in one of Europe&apos;s leading efforts to marry database technology with urban sustainability. Smart mobility &quot;The government hates it when people drive around looking for a place to park because there&apos;s more pollution and people get angry,&quot; he says. &quot;Obviously, it would be good if we could provide information to the driver where he could park.&quot; Enter TomTom. Working closely with the Amsterdam city government, Van der Lans and his team approached the navigation technology company to devise a solution to the empty parking space conundrum. Drivers in Amsterdam can now access real-time parking advice via their TomTom, saving hours of lost time while also cutting carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion. How is it done? By facilitating access to public databases, or what systems experts now call &quot;opening data&quot;. &quot;Amsterdam already owns thousands of datasets&quot;, explains Van der Lans. &quot;This data should be reusable by other systems\u2026 so we provide the public with this data, not on a sheet or on a map, but as data so that they can reuse it.&quot; In the case of Amsterdam, the municipal government has &quot;scanning cars&quot; that register licence plates and charge for parking accordingly. It also has systems to log the total numbers of cars in registered car parks, as well as in-time data on Park &amp; Ride usage. Layered within these datasets is information on historic parking patterns, from which probable parking availability can then be extrapolated. The trick is to collate such information in one place and present it in a way that is accessible to software developers and app makers, Van der Lans explains. He estimates that Amsterdam boasts a community of around 1,500 app designers. One of their early outputs is the ParkShark Amsterdam iPhone app, which was developed by independent website creators Glimworm to allow users to calculate parking charges. Smart energy As well as mobility, Van der Lans sees huge potential for open data in making urban energy use more sustainable. Information from smart meters can enable electricity distributors to better match supply with consumer demand. Installing the infrastructure for a so-called Smart Grid is easy if you&apos;re starting a city from scratch, as is happening in fast-growth countries such as China. It&apos;s not so easy in Amsterdam, a city with centuries of history. &quot;There are already some first examples of smart grids, but only in new areas. They have no idea how to do it with the old areas of Amsterdam where they have to re-do the whole thing \u2013 not only the applications within the house, but also the infrastructure underground,&quot; Van der Lans notes. His solution was to take a step back, and persuade some of the sector&apos;s big players to simply share details of their upcoming investment plans. The result was a pilot group comprising operational strategic planners from energy distributor Alliander, waste and water utility Waternet, energy producer Nuon, and the government-owned energy supplier Afval Energie Bedrijf. Each &quot;put their cards on the table&quot;, thereby enabling the Amsterdam Economic Board to design a virtual map that showed where future projects would overlap. By collating this information, and then building in other relevant datasets from the municipal government, the group has the grounds for a solid business case for Smart Grid investment. &quot;We have the plans of these different companies. We know what they plan to do and how much money they will put in to realise these plans\u2026 When we put all the budgets together we need, say, 100 million [euros]. But when we do it together, it costs us 80 million. Okay, so we save 20 million,&quot; says Van der Lans. Smart data His team is still in the initial stages, but their projects are already providing some important lessons. First is the need to be clear on the end goals. Releasing data requires a financial investment in data management systems on the part of the government. That investment needs to justified, says Van der Lans. That could be by achieving savings to the public purse through more efficient processes, or by helping the government meet its sustainability objectives. If it happens to be both, then all the better. From a project perspective, the big lesson centres on cooperation. A &quot;whole different way&quot; of working together is needed, Van der Lans points out. He describes the current approach in the energy sector as &quot;an infrastructure poker game&quot;, where companies keep information about their future investments close to their chests. &quot;You have to work together and share a good part of your data with your competitor otherwise it will never work,&quot; he explains. As his poker game analogy implies, data and transparency are not natural bedfellows. Especially in the business community, where information means knowledge and knowledge means profits. What Van der Lans has learned is that forcing companies to share their data tends not to work. His advice is to target with the willing instead. The Amsterdam Economic Board has identified 45 best practice cases of open data across Europe. The list includes Chromaroma, a game-based travel initiative in London, and Husetsweb, a Danish smart energy scheme. He also highlights the European Union-funded City SDK, which sees eight cities (Amsterdam, Barcelona, Helsinki, Istanbul, Lamia, Lisbon, Manchester and Rome) coming together to share data on mobility and tourism. Promoting open data may not feel as exciting as building grand urban designs, but the mark it makes on our cities could be just as significant in the years to come.

It took just 24 hours for over 12,000 advanced tickets to be snapped up when they were released in May, scoring a huge coup for the one-year-old Titanic Belfast museum. An undisclosed number \u2013 said to be &quot;a few thousand&quot; \u2013 have been withheld for those who turn up on the day, with large queues predicted. Five cities \u2013 the others are New York, S\u00e3o Paulo, Amsterdam and Toronto \u2013 have been chosen as destinations for the free exhibition. Curated by US television company HBO, it features over 70 artefacts from the series, including a selection of handmade costumes, Jon Snow&apos;s &quot;Longclaw&quot; sword, Cersei Lannister&apos;s red lion dress, and the model dragons that were used before CGI effects were added. Visitors will also have chance to sit in a precise replica of the famed iron throne and participate in an interactive Blackwater Bay battle scene.

We&apos;ve noticed people booking tickets from places as far away as Honduras, the Philippines and Uruguay.&quot; At the New York exhibition, which was unticketed, 5,000 people turned up every day.

Photograph: Robin Utrecht/EPA    Many are hoping Game of Thrones could do for tourism in Northern Ireland what Lord of the Rings did for New Zealand.

The nine-hour Belfast tour, costing from \u00a372pp, takes in the caves where red priestess Melisandre of Asshai gave birth to her &quot;shadow baby&quot;; Ballycastle, setting for the Free Cities where Lord Varys was born as a slave; and Dark Hedges road, where Arya Stark dressed as a boy to escape from King&apos;s Landing. Moyra Lock, from national film commission Northern Ireland Screen, was part of the team that enticed the production team to film in the country and says the reaction has been remarkable. &quot;It feels like Northern Ireland&apos;s profile has never been bigger, and in such a positive way. We took a punt on the pilot [filmed in 2009] and the spin-offs have been amazing. It&apos;s created an incredible buzz.&quot; And, for Northern Ireland, this could just be the beginning.

By the end of 2012, more than 4m guests had used the service since its launch in 2008 \u2013\u00a03m of those in 2012 alone \u2013\u00a0with more than 300k properties listed on the Airbnb site at the end of the year. The company is one of the shining stars of the &quot;sharing economy&quot; that&apos;s being celebrated at this year&apos;s LeWeb London conference, although like many of its peers in that movement, Airbnb&apos;s funding ($120m so far) is more celebrated than its revenues and profit (unknown). Co-founder Joe Gebbia spoke at LeWeb London to outline Airbnb&apos;s current strategy, its future plans and its tangles with politicians and regulators who believe the service is illegal (or, at least, should be regulated more). &quot;The story of Airbnb is really the underdog story, in many ways,&quot; said Gebbia, outlining the company&apos;s roots, when he and his housemates rented out their own living room (with airbeds \u2013\u00a0hence the name) to people coming to San Francisco for conferences. &quot;Since the very beginning we wanted to create an experience for our guests: more than just a place to sleep. We wanted to cook breakfast in the morning, we wanted to provide a subway map for our guests. Pick them up from the airport...&quot; Gebbia and co-founder Brian Chesky made $1k in the first weekend putting up guests in their apartment, showing them around San Francisco once the conference sessions were done. &quot;Something even more powerful than the money was the social experience we had with these three guests,&quot; said Gebbia. Cue a third co-founder \u2013\u00a0Nathan Blecharczyk \u2013\u00a0and a proper website for Airbnb to help other people with space to rent to guests, which went through several iterations as Airbedandbreakfast, before a rebranding and relaunch as Airbnb in March 2009. There were some painful times trying to raise money from investors along the way. &quot;10 returned our email, five met us for coffee, zero invested. They thought the idea was crazy, and it was a liabiity to have two designers and one technologist [on the founding team],&quot; said Gebbia. Fast forward, and the company has found investors happy to look beyond those initial prejudices. In 2013, Airbnb is also a global business, with properties available in 192 countries, and staff dotted around the world. &quot;Last year, the business actually tipped, where we were doing more trips and reservations outside the United States than domestically,&quot; he said. &quot;We started to plant flags in our key markets. One thing that&apos;s been very important for us from the beginning is being close to the community.&quot; How so? By hiring staff in the different countries to build the community of Airbnb hosts, including holding meetups \u2013 one in London the day before the LeWeb conference, for example. &quot;For an international business such as ours, you can&apos;t localise without a local,&quot; said Gebbia. &quot;That was a hard lesson for us. We had to be closer, physically present, which is when we put teams on the ground.&quot; What about the legal issues, in cities and countries where people aren&apos;t allowed to rent out their rooms or properties without being licensed to do so? New York, Amsterdam and Quebec are just three high-profile examples of places where Airbnb has faced regulatory scrutiny. Gebbia was bullish in his response. &quot;When the car was introduced in 1908, people could experience a brand new way to travel that was more efficient than a horse and buggy,&quot; he said. &quot;Can you believe that cities tried to outlaw cars in the United States? Can you imagine driving a car for a year then having to go back to a horse and buggy? The policy-makers adjusted to meet the demands of the people. We believe it&apos;s time for our invention, and it appears the world agrees, given we&apos;re in 40k cities in 192 countries.&quot; Gebbia batted back questions about finances and plans for an IPO. When is Airbnb going public? &quot;It would be a misuse of our time to put any thought into that now. We have a community to create and care for,&quot; he said. Revenues? &quot;Oh, we don&apos;t talk about that.&quot; Gebbia also parried a question about whether Airbnb&apos;s growth is bad news for the traditional hotels industry. &quot;If you have a pie-chart o all the available combinations in a city, it&apos;s not like we&apos;re taking a slice out of the pie. We&apos;re taking the pie and making it bigger.&quot; Asked about future plans, Gebbia said Airbnb thinks about the internet as a play of three acts. In the 1990s, act one was how to get people on the internet and using it. Act two, once a critical mass of people was online, was helping them connect to one another on social networks and upload content. And Act three? &quot;We now have a critical mass of people all connected online, and act three is about getting them back offline,&quot; said Gebbia. &quot;The big challenge now is how to design the online to offline transition. That&apos;s what we&apos;re thinking about: how to seamlessly merge online and offline.&quot; He also had some advice for fellow entrepreneurs (and wannabe entrepreneurs) itching for a slice of the sharing economy. &quot;Entrepreneurship is about connecting two dots in a new and different way,&quot; he said. &quot;My advice for aspiring entrepreneurs out there is to marry the problem. Find a problem that you&apos;re so close to that you can empathise with it in a way that others can&apos;t... You can see it so closely, that it gives you that ability to connect the two dots together.&quot;", "sentences": ["New York, Amsterdam and Quebec are just three high-profile examples of places where Airbnb has faced regulatory scrutiny."], "title": "Airbnb co-founder: 'We believe it's time for our invention, and it appears the world agrees'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/jun/05/airbnb-leweb-london-joe-gebbia", "tags": ["Apps", "Technology", "Technology startups", "Travel & leisure", "Smartphones"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-06-05T11:45:00Z", "article": "In an ideal world, scientific discoveries would be independent of what scientists wanted to discover. A good researcher would begin with an idea, devise a method to test the idea, run the study as planned, and then decide based on the evidence whether the idea had been supported. Following this approach would lead us step-by-step toward a better understanding of nature. Unfortunately, the life sciences are becoming increasingly estranged from this way of thinking. Early in their training, students learn that the quest for truth needs to be balanced against the more immediate pressure to &quot;publish or perish&quot;. For a junior scientist to compete at securing a permanent academic position, her top priority must be to publish in journals with the greatest prestige and impact. If she survives to become a senior scientist, she&apos;s likely to then pass this lesson on to her own PhD students. This publishing culture is toxic to science. Recent studies have shown how intense career pressures encourage life scientists to engage in a range of questionable practices to generate publications \u2013 behaviours such as cherry-picking data or analyses that allow clear narratives to be presented, reinventing the aims of a study after it has finished to &quot;predict&quot; unexpected findings, and failing to ensure adequate statistical power. These are not the actions of a small minority; they are common, and result from the environment and incentive structures that most scientists work within. At the same time, journals incentivise bad practice by favouring the publication of results that are considered to be positive, novel, neat and eye-catching. In many life sciences, negative results, complicated results, or attempts to replicate previous studies never make it into the scientific record. Instead they occupy a vast unpublished file drawer. The scientific community is well aware of these problems \u2013 in fact, we&apos;ve known about them for decades. The problem is that any one scientist opting to work beyond the system immediately disadvantages herself relative to her peers. The only solution is structural reform, and to this end some of us have recently taken steps to drive change. Since May this year, the journal Cortex, a peer-reviewed outlet for science on the nervous system and behaviour, has offered authors the opportunity to publish a type of article called a registered report. Unlike traditional scientific publishing, in which manuscripts are peer reviewed only after studies have been completed, registered reports are reviewed before scientists collect data. If the scientific question and methods are deemed sound, the authors are then offered &quot;in-principle acceptance&quot; of their article, which virtually guarantees publication regardless of how the results turn out. The journals Attention, Perception &amp; Psychophysics and Perspectives on Psychological Science have launched similar projects. Both initiatives borrow from the now-established requirement that clinical trials pre-register their study protocols. But these new initiatives go even further by offering publication of the eventual results in the same journal, regardless of what is found. By basing editorial decisions on the question and method, rather than the results, pre-registration overcomes the publication bias that blocks negative findings from the literature. And by conducting peer review both before and after a study is completed, questionable practices to increase &quot;publishability&quot; are greatly reduced. The aim here isn&apos;t to punish the academic community for playing the game that we created; rather, we seek to change the rules of the game itself. Critics have argued that pre-registration is overzealous and will hinder exploration, meaning serendipitous findings would remain hidden to us. We agree that exploration is vital, but while this concern is understandable, it is also easy to guard against. For instance, the registered reports initiative allows authors to report on any aspect of their data \u2013 even when such analyses are not registered at the outset. However, these outcomes are clearly labelled as exploratory to make them distinct from the pre-planned analyses. Registered reports also require authors to publicly release their raw data so that other scientists can explore the results in unanticipated ways, now and in the future. Our publishing culture is conservative and slow to evolve. Following the Cortex initiative, some of us have witnessed quiet resistance to pre-registration from other journals. These outlets fear that agreeing to publish papers before seeing the data could lock them into publishing negative results or other findings conventionally regarded as &quot;boring&quot;. This is despite the fact that clear-cut negative outcomes can be tremendously informative, telling us which potential interventions don&apos;t work or which suspected phenomena don&apos;t actually exist. The deeper concern of journals is that pre-registration threatens existing &quot;prestige&quot; hierarchies and could reduce a journal&apos;s impact factor \u2013 a metric that is arguably meaningless as an indicator of scientific quality and, in fact, predicts the rate of article retractions due to fraud. Nobody can expect scientists to sacrifice their livelihoods or those of their proteges for the good of the cause. So, as a group of scientists with positions on more than 100 journal editorial boards, we are calling for all empirical journals in the life sciences \u2013 including those journals that we serve \u2013 to offer pre-registered articles at the earliest opportunity. The guidelines for the initiatives at Cortex and Perspectives are straightforward, and while specific kinds of studies will require specific solutions, the general principle is widely applicable. For pre-registration to benefit science it must be embraced by a broad spectrum of journals. Study pre-registration doesn&apos;t fit all forms of science, and it isn&apos;t a cure-all for scientific publishing. But it is a crucial part of urgent wider reform. Our publishing culture is no longer fit for purpose and the time has come to offer scientists a genuine alternative to &quot;publish or perish&quot;. If the life sciences are to preserve a legacy of truth, journals must welcome pre-registration with open arms.

He&apos;s on stage at the National Theatre, playing a Conservative MP in a drama called This House. Despite hoping for a safe home-counties seat with haystacks and hillocks, his character has just been elected MP for the Worcestershire town of Redditch. &quot;You can&apos;t find a haystack in Redditch,&quot; he bellows, &quot;because of all the fucking\u00a0needles!&quot; Ninety-five miles away, in Redditch, a huge cheer goes up at the local Vue cinema. In Sheffield, there&apos;s applause when another Tory MP snootily suggests Manchester &quot;either needs a good clean or a good fire&quot;, while at the Covent Garden Odeon in London, the man next to me almost chokes on his noodles from laughing so hard. &quot;I\u00a0hope people cheered like a football crowd when they heard their town mentioned,&quot; playwright James Graham says the next morning. &quot;I like to imagine a Mexican wave of laughter going round the country.&quot; Not just this country. Director Jeremy Herrin has a friend watching in New York. One cast member receives a congratulatory text from Canada. Graham gets tweets from strangers in Amsterdam, Berlin and Bucharest. His mum&apos;s watching in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. &quot;That people have invested time, energy and belief that my play would find a global audience,&quot; he wonders aloud, sipping his hangover-beating coffee, &quot;I&apos;ve got no sense of the scale of it.&quot; On 16 May, the NT Live broadcast of This House played to 45,000 people in cinemas around the UK. That&apos;s equivalent to selling out the National&apos;s main auditorium for more than five weeks solid. Another 20,000 watched overseas. More will follow with encore screenings. Since the first such broadcast in 2009 \u2013 when Helen Mirren&apos;s Ph\u00e8dre was seen by 50,000 people worldwide \u2013 NT Live has achieved a total audience of 1.3 million. &quot;It&apos;s gone much better than anyone expected,&quot; says David Sabel, the National&apos;s head of digital. &quot;The uptake has been so phenomenal that a broadcast can sometimes break even on UK box office alone.&quot; Sabel began his career in the building as an intern in 2008, when he wrote a report estimating that NT Live would need to reach 500 screens worldwide to cover average costs of \u00a3200,000. &quot;Now we&apos;re on about 650 screens, 260 in the UK.&quot; That&apos;s a third of Britain&apos;s cinemas; Bond film Skyfall screened in about half. What started out losing \u00a330,000 now gets &quot;a\u00a0modest return&quot;. Sabel was initially &quot;quite sceptical&quot; but was converted, along with the NT&apos;s top dogs, when they attended a Met Opera Live broadcast in a cinema: &quot;It felt theatrical. People had dressed up. They were reading programmes.&quot; Despite the sense of occasion, no one was sure the format would work for theatre. &quot;Opera is always opera. You&apos;ve got the music and you can&apos;t escape the artform. Our concern was that once you point cameras at a play, you bring the expectations of a film-goer. But we&apos;re trying to capture a theatrical event.&quot; So how to translate theatre to the cinema without losing its immediacy? On a screen, even great shows can look hammy, turgid and dead. To avoid this, specialist camera directors are bought in: musicals get music concert directors, Shakespeare goes to drama types. This House falls to Tim van Someren, whose credits also include panel shows and awards ceremonies. &quot;Our aim is to film your performance,&quot; he tells the cast at a rehearsal, &quot;not shape your performance for film.&quot; He tells me later: &quot;The key is to remember it&apos;s not just a play \u2013 it&apos;s tonight&apos;s performance at the Olivier theatre. We don&apos;t show cut-aways of audience members laughing, like on TV. But if they&apos;re in shot, we don&apos;t shy away from showing\u00a0them.&quot; His first task is to decide how to film each moment. &quot;You can&apos;t cut it like EastEnders,&quot; he says. &quot;It would be too busy. And someone&apos;s face in closeup on a 20ft screen is a bit much.&quot; Zoom out to show the whole stage, however, and it&apos;s dull. He&apos;s got six cameras to play with: two fixed, two tracking, a crane and a Steadicam. &quot;You feel a rhythm. If you&apos;re doing a farce, it&apos;s very cut-cut-cut. Shakespeare is slower.&quot; This House has about 1,000 shots. He works from two broadcast vans parked outside the National. The cameramen are directed from here; the six feeds, 16 microphones and the soundtrack are mixed together, and subtitles are added \u2013 all live. It&apos;s a complex procedure, so each broadcast has the luxury of two rehearsals and a private screening to iron out problems. Everything is tweaked for the cameras. The crying of a (fake) baby is turned down for the microphones. Lighting is softened. Projections are brightened. Giuseppe Cannas and his makeup team redo every wig, replacing sturdy theatre weaves with more natural &quot;camera-friendly&quot; hair. Bald patches become a concern. &quot;HD is extremely unforgiving,&quot; says Cannas. &quot;Everything needs to be toned down: eyebrows, mouth, contouring, thickness of foundation.&quot; For the actors, too, the rehearsals are a chance to get comfortable with the cameras. Lauren O&apos;Neill, now appearing in her second broadcast, says NT Live brings &quot;a new set of nerves. You become aware of how many times you blink. It&apos;s very strange.&quot; And the cast don&apos;t know which camera&apos;s\u00a0broadcasting at any one moment. So what next? There are no plans to extend NT Live online, but &quot;never say never,&quot; says Sabel. Curiously, the broadcasts haven&apos;t diminished audiences for regional tours or West End transfers. There will be more collaborations with other theatres, too. Next up is NT Live&apos;s first West End show: The Audience with Helen Mirren as the monarch. Tom Hiddleston&apos;s Coriolanus at the Donmar follows in January; and Kenneth Branagh&apos;s Macbeth, in Manchester next month, has just been confirmed. &quot;There&apos;s been a real shift in our thinking,&quot; Sabel explains. &quot;NT Live has built its own audience, who can see eight productions a year without setting foot inside this building. We used to think the ultimate success was someone seeing an NT Live, then coming to the theatre. Now we see it as a success in its own right. Our audience isn&apos;t just about the bricks and mortar. It&apos;s much, much bigger than\u00a0that.&quot;", "sentences": ["Graham gets tweets from strangers in Amsterdam, Berlin and Bucharest."], "title": "The surprise success of NT Live", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jun/09/nt-live-success", "tags": ["National Theatre", "Stage", "Theatre", "Film", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-06-10T14:19:54Z", "article": "&quot;People used to give me &apos;bad eyes&apos;. They shouted, &apos;Thief! Thief!&apos; I had no clothes for my children. Some days I woke up and had food, but some days I did not.&quot; Saru Bai is a waste picker. Her livelihood depends on kachna chivadne \u2013 &apos;rummaging through rubbish&apos; \u2013 to salvage sellable items. Plastic: 5 rupees a kilo. Newspaper: 1 rupee a kilo. Glass bottles: 50 paisa each \u2013 1 rupee 50 paisa if it&apos;s a Kingfisher bottle. Aluminium cans... Cardboard packaging... Miscellaneous scraps of metal... Around 2 million people depend on India&apos;s informal waste-picking economy. They work from sunrise to sunset, travelling up to ten miles a day, supporting loads of 40 kg on their heads. Daily, they contend with cats, dogs and vermin; needles, metal shards and glass fragments. They work among unstable landfills, where mountains of waste sporadically collapse, trapping those inside. They are cheated by scrap dealers who fix the weights of scales. They are ostracised by citizens and harassed by the police. And they are 92 percent female. Shailaja, an activist for Kagad Kach Patra Kastakari Panchayat (KKPKP), a waste pickers&apos; cooperative in Pune, explained the occupation&apos;s distinctly gendered composition. In 1972 a drought in Maharashtra drove poor rural families to Pune. Men found work as labourers but women, on account of their gender and caste, were unable to secure &apos;respectable work&apos;. Still today, only the most vulnerable collect waste: almost all are women, the majority are Dalit and a third have been widowed or deserted. With no other skills or education they are forced to endure dangerous conditions and work long hours for around 60 rupees (70 pence) a day. KKPKP estimates that half of these women contribute at least 50 percent of household income. Despite collectively cleaning the country, scrap collection is not recognised as work, nor scrap collectors as workers. Consequently, waste pickers receive no employment guarantee, regular wage of state benefits. Given the dangerous and insecure nature of the work, it is a fragile existence. Although successive governments have pledged to guarantee the rights of women, measures invariably fall short. The National Commission for Women Act, 1990, first sought to safeguard against gender discrimination, introducing 33 percent reservation of seats for women in political bodies and select public institutions. But India&apos;s waste pickers are not recognised in official statistics. Indeed, a recent report by the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Labour Studies revealed that well over 90 percent of employment in India is &apos;informal&apos; or &apos;unrecognised&apos; labour. State-level policies to guarantee labour rights and break down gender-based discrimination only have an impact on a minority; those that most need support \u2013 vulnerable women in low-paid, dangerous employment \u2013 are ignored, unrecognised. Moreover, women in vulnerable employment are powerless to challenge gender discrimination and assert the same rights as their male counterparts. According to the International Labour Organisation, illiterate women working in unskilled occupations can expect an average of 85 rupees per day; illiterate men doing such work receive 177 rupees. Despite the World Bank&apos;s decree to put &quot;resources into the hands of poor women&quot;, few women in India have profited: the majority continue to endure lower pay, longer hours and fewer opportunities than men. But as I found in Pune, empowering women has wide-reaching effects on the lives and wellbeing of low-income families in India. For Saru Bai and 7000 women in Pune, life has changed. In 1993, a waste pickers&apos; collective, the KKPKP, was formed to address inequities in the unregulated waste-picking economy. After twenty years of activism, waste pickers now boast identity cards authorised by Pune Municipal Corporation, a health insurance plan, and defined areas for collection. They no longer visit dangerous landfills; exploitation by scrap dealers and harassment by the police has ceased; and waste pickers are respected for their service to the city&apos;s environment. Before we were &quot;counted among the animals,&quot; says Saru Bai. But now, it has changed: &quot;Citizens talk to me and call me into their house and say, &apos;Saru Bai, have some tea.&apos;&quot; This paradigm shift in attitudes towards scrap collection, which has vastly improved working conditions for female waste pickers, has been accompanied by astonishing socio-economic effects. With women empowered to demand fair remuneration for their work, waste-picking now provides a secure source of income for thousands of women. The generational cycle of waste-picking in Pune has been dismantled, leading to social uplift for thousands of families. At a scrap dealer&apos;s shop I met ten women who were cashing in their day&apos;s collection. Counted among their siblings were a plumber, a painter, an MA, a BEd and a dental assistant. The extra income of female waste pickers has afforded families the means to educate their children with skills and training to secure a better life. The opportunity for income generation and improved working conditions are such that increasingly men are being drawn towards this traditionally female occupation. While World Bank rhetoric focuses on empowering women as a way to generate &quot;large developmental payoffs&quot; on a macro scale, we should not distance ourselves from the lives of individual women and families. There may be economic output, but the real payoff is in ending the abuse of Saru Bai; in empowering Vaishali to earn enough money to send her children to college. The impact of empowering women in the workplace is witnessed in the day-to-day work of grassroots organisations. Pune is somewhat unique in its approach to waste pickers: across India, tens of thousands continue to suffer discrimination, exploitation and abuse; and millions of women in other vulnerable occupations see their rights to safe and secure employment denied. The country demands more local initiatives focusing on specific communities, to break down gender discrimination and empower women to secure their own futures and those of their children. Although Shailaja reiterates that there is a long way to go, waste-picker activism in Pune has achieved this particular goal. Today, Saru Bai can stand proudly in front of her composting machine and tell me, &quot;Now we save [and] my children will earn good money, so I&apos;m happy.&quot;", "sentences": ["Indeed, a recent report by the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Labour Studies revealed that well over 90 percent of employment in India is &apos;informal&apos; or &apos;unrecognised&apos; labour."], "title": "Rummaging through rubbish", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/06/rummaging-through-rubbish", "tags": ["International Development Journalism competition"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-06-10T18:28:59Z", "article": "Clive Brittain has become the second trainer in Newmarket to discuss the use on his horses of Sungate, a joint treatment which contains the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol. Gerard Butler, his fellow trainer in the town, may lose his licence through disciplinary action arising from the discovery of Sungate in his horses but Brittain expects to avoid punishment because in his case the relevant horses were out of training at the time. Brittain is a client of Rossdales, the vets&apos; practice named by Butler as responsible for injecting several of his horses with Sungate. Butler has been charged by the British Horseracing Authority with several offences, including having injected some horses himself rather than using a vet, and BHA investigators have since been working their way through Rossdales&apos; client list to establish how widespread was the use of Sungate. &quot;They came round and we had a talk,&quot; Brittain said on Monday. He has been given no indication as to whether he may also face charges but says he would be &quot;surprised&quot; if so. &quot;Any of the horses that were treated by the vets were horses recovering from serious injury,&quot; he added. &quot;They weren&apos;t in training, they were at rest. These horses were months away from a racecourse. It would only have been the horses that had fractures we&apos;d be talking about, six or seven at the most.&quot; With an isolation yard and a swimming pool, Brittain said he is unusually well placed to deal with injured animals at his premises. Contacted on his mobile phone, Brittain said he was away from his office and so could not name any of the horses involved or offer exact details about the times when Sungate was used. However, he insisted that the time between each horse being treated and then returning to the racecourse was so great that the effect of any steroid must have worn off. &quot;When a horse has a fracture, you treat it, you give it time and then you give it more time. It wasn&apos;t there to boost their growth,&quot; he said. Brittain, who has won every British Classic except the Derby and famously won at the 1985 Breeders&apos; Cup with Pebbles, feels he has a fine reputation to maintain, saying: &quot;We&apos;ve never had a horse test positive for anything.&quot; Asked if he would have allowed the use of Sungate, had he known it contained an anabolic steroid, he replied: &quot;Certainly not, because we&apos;ve never used anything like that and never would.&quot; Rossdales, he reports, were responsible for recommending and supplying Sungate. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t have access to anything like that, I&apos;m not a qualified vet.&quot; But Brittain has no qualms about continuing to use Rossdales. &quot;I&apos;ve every trust in my vets. If they vet a horse for sale from the yard and anything is wrong with the horse, they report it. You couldn&apos;t have a straighter practice. I don&apos;t think that people realised Sungate was a problem.&quot; Brittain can take some comfort from the 2011 ruling of a BHA disciplinary panel in the case of Howard Johnson, three of whose horses were treated with an anabolic steroid. One of those horses was found to have been out of training at the relevant time, even though it was on Johnson&apos;s farm and in his stables overnight, and he was therefore unpunished in respect of that horse. Rossdales have made no comment on the Sungate case, even when Butler named them in Saturday&apos;s Guardian as the practice whose vet introduced the substance to his yard. Offered the chance to comment on Monday, the firm declined once more. Online reports from two vets conferences record Rossdales&apos; partners as discussing the use of stanozolol to treat racehorses with joint problems, at Saratoga in August 2011 and at the European Vets Conference in Amsterdam in April 2012. The firm&apos;s Peter Ramzan is recorded as citing a study in which 50 racehorses took part. David Dugdale, a partner in the rival practice Newmarket Equine Hospital, said on Monday that his firm had never used Sungate. Shortly before the Butler story broke, he had sought clarification from the BHA as to whether it could be used on racehorses in training and was told it could not. In any case, he added: &quot;The science on this is unproven, speculative. We&apos;d need a whole lot more evidence before even thinking of using it out of training. And if you take a horse out of training, time and rest are what&apos;s going to do the good, not any intra-articular injection [an injection into the joint].&quot;", "sentences": ["Online reports from two vets conferences record Rossdales&apos; partners as discussing the use of stanozolol to treat racehorses with joint problems, at Saratoga in August 2011 and at the European Vets Conference in Amsterdam in April 2012."], "title": "Clive Brittain second Newmarket trainer to reveal Sungate use on horses", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/10/clive-brittain-newmarket-sungate-horses", "tags": ["Horse racing", "British Horseracing Authority", "Drugs in sport", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-06-12T12:24:00Z", "article": "     Carling Black Label: &apos;Squirrel&apos; (00:03) - UK Bronze winner in 1990 The long-running Carling Black Label campaign was in its heyday when WCRS made this commercial featuring footage of a resourceful squirrel overcoming a series of tricky obstacles for a nutty reward to the theme music from Mission: Impossible.

God, I would love to be that person!&quot; Philo, creative director of C\u00e9line, is not that person. As the London Evening Standard put it: &quot;Unfortunately for the famously publicity-shy London designer \u2013 Paris born, Harrow-on-the-Hill raised \u2013 who has reinvented the way modern women dress, privacy may well continue to be a luxury.&quot; Nobody who is oxymoronically described as &quot;famously publicity-shy&quot; will ever be unGoogleable. And if you&apos;re not unGoogleable then, if Philo is right, you can never be truly chic, even if you were born in Paris. And if you&apos;re not truly chic, then you might as well die \u2013 at least if you&apos;re in fashion. If she truly wanted to disappear herself from Google, Philo could start by changing her superb name to something less diverting. Prize-winning novelist AM Homes is an outlier in this respect. Google &quot;am homes&quot; and you&apos;re in a world of blah US real estate rather than cutting-edge literature. But then Homes has thought a lot about privacy, having written a play about the most famously private person in recent history, JD Salinger, and had him threaten to sue her as a result. And Homes isn&apos;t the only one to make herself difficult to detect online. UnGoogleable bands are 10 a penny. The New York-based band !!! (known verbally as &quot;chick chick chick&quot; or &quot;bang bang bang&quot; \u2013 apparently &quot;Exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point&quot; proved too verbose for their meagre fanbase) must drive their business manager nuts. As must the band Merchandise, whose name \u2013 one might think \u2013 is a nominalist satire of commodification by the music industry. Nice work, Brad, Con, John and Rick.     Phoebe Philo: anonymity would be helped by a less distinctive name. Photograph: Gareth Cattermole    If Philo renamed herself online as Google Maps or @, she might make herself more chic. Welcome to anonymity chic \u2013 the antidote to an online world of exhibitionism. But let&apos;s not go crazy: anonymity may be chic, but it is no business model. For years XXX Porn Site, my confusingly named alt-folk combo, has remained undiscovered. There are several bands called Girls (at least one of them including, confusingly, dudes) and each one has worried \u2013 after a period of chic iconoclasm \u2013 that such a putatively cool name means no one can find them online. But still, maybe we should all embrace anonymity, given this week&apos;s revelations that technology giants cooperated in Prism, a top-secret system at the US National Security Agency that collects emails, documents, photos and other material for secret service agents to review. It has also been a week in which Lindsay Mills, girlfriend of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, has posted on her blog (entitled: &quot;Adventures of a world-traveling, pole-dancing super hero&quot; with many photos showing her performing with the Waikiki Acrobatic Troupe) her misery that her fugitive boyfriend has fled to Hong Kong. Only a cynic would suggest that this blog post might help the Waikiki Acrobating Troupe veteran&apos;s career at this \u2013 serious face \u2013 difficult time. Better the dignity of silent anonymity than using the internet for that. Furthermore, as social media diminishes us with not just information overload but the 24/7 servitude of liking, friending and status updating, this going under the radar reminds us that we might benefit from withdrawing the labour on which the founders of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have built their billions. &quot;Today our intense cultivation of a singular self is tied up in the drive to constantly produce and update,&quot; argues Geert Lovink, research professor of interactive media at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam and author of Networks Without a Cause: A Critique of Social Media. &quot;You have to tweet, be on Facebook, answer emails,&quot; says Lovink. &quot;So the time pressure on people to remain present and keep up their presence is a very heavy load that leads to what some call the psychopathology of online.&quot; Internet evangelists such as Clay Shirky and Charles Leadbeater hoped for something very different from this pathologised reality. In Shirky&apos;s Here Comes Everybody and Leadbeater&apos;s We-Think, both published in 2008, the nascent social media were to echo the anti-authoritarian, democratising tendencies of the 60s counterculture. Both men revelled in the fact that new web-based social tools helped single mothers looking online for social networks and pro-democracy campaigners in Belarus. Neither sufficiently realised that these tools could just as readily be co-opted by The Man. Or, if you prefer, Mark Zuckerberg. Not that Zuckerberg is the devil in this story. Social media have changed the way we interact with other people in line with what the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman wrote in Liquid Love. For us &quot;liquid moderns&quot;, who have lost faith in the future, cannot commit to relationships and have few kinship ties, Zuckerberg created a new way of belonging, one in which we use our wits to create provisional bonds loose enough to stop suffocation, but tight enough to give a needed sense of security now that the traditional sources of solace (family, career, loving relationships) are less reliable than ever.     Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook: created a new way of belonging. Photograph: Bloomberg    As Malcolm Gladwell wrote in Small Change: Why the revolution will not be tweeted, this new sociability was something of a boon. &quot;There is strength in weak ties ... Our acquaintances \u2013 not our friends \u2013 are our greatest source of new ideas and information. The internet lets us exploit the power of these kinds of distant connections with marvellous efficiency. It&apos;s terrific at the diffusion of innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration, seamlessly matching up buyers and sellers, and the logistical functions of the dating world.&quot; But for Gladwell, weak ties like this were no panacea: &quot;The evangelists of social media don&apos;t understand this distinction; they seem to believe that a Facebook friend is the same as a real friend and that signing up for a donor registry in Silicon Valley today is activism in the same sense as sitting at a segregated lunch counter in Greensboro in 1960.&quot; The dream of online anonymity revives an old romantic hope \u2013 that we might disappear ourselves, like Salinger, from an unfeeling world that is doomed to intrude upon and misconstrues our authentic selves in equal measure. Better anonymity than the lie-dream of new sociability. Only in private can we truly be ourselves. Viewed thus, the internet is less a tool than an onerous machine for hype and lies, when all these bands and fashion desginers want is to let their artistic genius express itself silently, anonymously \u2013 without numpties sicking up opinions on their oeuvre. The internet, at worst, disconnects us from ourselves, cutting us off from what really matters in life. It&apos;s an old theme, this notion of industrial and post-industrial society imposing false consciousness on the innocent, and one that is given a new resonance in the information age where the online clamour for attention makes us dream of cancelling our broadband contract and going to live in the woods on berries. Hence, the popularity of Sylvain Tesson&apos;s memoir Consolations of the Forest, about a man who decides to live like a hermit in Siberia for six months. It speaks to our desire to escape civilisation \u2013 at least for a while. (Six months is about enough. After that, any sentient being would go postal. After six months we can return, post our pictures on Instagram, change our Facebook status, watch what we recorded on our hard drive and get our agent to sell our memoir.) This dream of going anonymous overlaps with another paean to social disconnection. In her book Quiet, Susan Cain rails against our excessive and misguided respect for extroverts. Before the industrial revolution, she writes, American self-help books extolled character. Nowadays, personality is venerated. That cult of personality is enabled by social media, where extrovert self-presentation is what gets you friended and followed. The noisome extroverts yucking up their nothingy conversations on buses while the rest of us try to get to grips with early Wittgenstein (why haven&apos;t introverts invented a volume control for extroverts if they are, as Cain suggests, so clever?) have their parallel on Twitter. After Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can&apos;t Stop Talking, which was, in Jon Ronson&apos;s description, &quot;the Female Eunuch for anxious nerds&quot;, we need another book: Unembraceable You: The Pleasures of Disconnecting from an Online World Gone Nuts \u2013 a God Delusion for recovering geeks. But the dream of anonymity is not just about conquering addiction, nor about silencing cyberspace&apos;s extroverts, but also about eluding the tentacles of power before they disappear into your proverbial underpants with malice aforethought. In cyberspace, our every keystroke is monitorable, tradable, if not traded, by corporations and exchangeable, if not exchanged, by security agencies.     Hard to Google: Nic Offer of the band !!!  Photograph: Startraks Photo/Rex Features    This totalitarian vision of how the internet works may seem fanciful, but it was once envisaged as a good thing. In the 1930s, HG Wells wrote of a &quot;world brain&quot; through which &quot;the whole human memory can be ... made accessible to every individual&quot;. Today, perhaps we have that world brain, and it is called Google. Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, professor of internet governance and regulation at the University of Oxford&apos;s Internet Institute, sounds an Orwellian note about this: &quot;Quite literally, Google knows more about us than we can remember ourselves.&quot; No wonder some dream of slipping under Google&apos;s radar. In the 19th century, Jeremy Bentham envisaged a prison called a panopticon in which guards could watch prisoners without them knowing whether they were being watched. In the 20th century, Michel Foucault argued that the model of the panopticon was used more abstractly to exercise control over society. In the 21st century, Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger argues that the panopticon now extends across time and cyberspace, making us act as if we are watched even if we are not. In his book Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age, Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger points out that the digital revolution makes it is easier to keep everything \u2013 the drunken email you sent your boss, the wacky photo you put on Facebook \u2013 rather than go through the palaver of deciding what to consign to oblivion. Though, really, we should do that hard work \u2013 this at least was the point of the professor&apos;s book. We must all erase our traces or face the consequences. What is most striking about what Phoebe Philo says about the desirability of online anonymity is that she couches it in terms of the fashionista&apos;s holy grail \u2013 chic. If she&apos;s right, and I think she may well be, this means we need a revolution in our thinking not just about social media, but about economics. Ever since Thorsten Veblen wrote The Theory of the Leisured Class in 1899, economic status has been signaled by conspicuous consumption and grandstanding leisure. That&apos;s why you moored your yacht off Rhodes and invited Peter Mandelson and George Osborne over to stay, thus proving that not only were you a Russian billionaire but you knew how to flaunt that status to best effect. Status on social media was demonstrated similarly by conspicuous consumption&apos;s online counterpart: conspicuous presence. Status-seeking cybernauts sought more Twitter followers than Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and Barack Obama combined. Zuckerberg facilitated an egalitarian revolution whereby high status could be demonstrated by those without money: social capital, unlike real capital, transcended monetary wealth. But anonymity chic means we need to rethink economics in light of the collapse of the social networking model of human worth. Anonymity chic confounds the idea that the more overbearing your online presence, the higher your status. Rather, in the new economy of self-presentation, oversupply of yourself reduces your market value. To be chic, by contrast, involves withholding yourself \u2013 and in extremis making yourself anonymous, invisible, unavailable to the masses. Online status didn&apos;t used to be like this. If you were Stephen Fry, you checked into your St Petersburg hotel room and tweeted the view of the Neva before unpacking your toothbrush. You made an investment, surrendering your privacy in return for the status boost of being followed by strangers. Philo reverses this economics: what was once high status became vulgar self-delusion and self-betrayal. But there is a philosophical paradox in the anonymity chic. If to be chic is to be anonymous, how will anyone know that you&apos;re chic? How can you prove your status while not expressing it? To be chic minimally requires being seen or at least noticed. Most of those who want anonymity don&apos;t seek to be chic. Rather, they sound like backwoods libertarians \u2013 the kind of people who hate government, think taxes are unconscionable, the National Grid Hitlerian, and that with every keystroke you die a little (think: Ron Swanson in Parks and Recreation). For example, one of the many anonymous persons who list ways to fly under the radar of online surveillance explains how to go about it: &quot;If you are going to be using the internet in your secret lifestyle, you should do everything you can to secure yourself online. This means using PGP (encryption software) when emailing people (and using an email account that can not be traced to you directly), and, most importantly, it means saying nothing online that you would not be prepared to see on the front page of the newspaper.&quot; If only the woman who gloatingly tweeted that she&apos;d knocked over a cyclist had read it. But it&apos;s also bad advice, since it suggests that there is such a thing as a secret lifestyle, unGoogleable and pure, untarnished by the grubby accommodations of living in society. Geert Lovink thinks such advice is a delusion: &quot;You should not promote anonymity as a solution \u2013 then you&apos;re fooling yourself and others. It is always possible for any authority to track you down. There&apos;s no such thing as absolute anonymity.&quot; What then should we do to resist information overload, cyber slavery, toxic trolling, intolerable corporate and state snooping apart from becoming anonymous? Lovink counsels self-mastery, and learning how to reduce the internet&apos;s impact on our lives. There is, he says, a parallel with other technologies. &quot;We are no longer impressed by vacuum cleaners and refrigerators.&quot; he says. &quot;They don&apos;t foreground themselves so much.&quot; The internet needs to be similarly disenchanted. Perhaps, but that all sounds nebulous \u2013 and certainly not as chic as making oneself unGoogleable. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 June 2013.

It was Melbourne Cup, but London was dark, rainy and indifferent. That all changed when I set foot in the Walkabout. It was wild: some sort of Bacchanal or Daily Mail spread come to life. Girls in arse-skimming skirts and eye-gouging fascinators drunk and falling down; the boys, bleary-eyed and leering, in huddles playing drinking games. After two years away from home, the concentration of Australian accents was jarring. Did I really talk like that? Did I really drink like that? The answer to both questions was yes. Just not in an Australian-themed pub. I Ran-about from the Walkabout \u2013 ending up in some quiet old pub in Holborn, where there was no music, just a few old guys sitting around reading the Telegraph and drinking half-pints of bitter. This was more like it! A class system of sorts forms as soon as you arrive in London and get your bearings \u2013 and the Walkabout is an important signifier in this. Are you the type of Australian who drinks at an Aussie-themed pub? Do you hang out for the free sheet TNT and circle the listings? Wonder when Wil Anderson is doing a gig in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, how easy is it to get tickets to see Empire of the Sun, and whether you can stream hottest 100 or if it\u2019s geo-blocked? This type becomes more Australian when they leave Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s the best country on earth,\u201d they say, thinking of the sapphire glint of Sydney Harbour as they survey the silty Thames with pity. The Walkabout is their home away from home. There is another tribe \u2013 let\u2019s call them the globalised Australians \u2013 who try to hide any hints of their nationality. Their accents became neutralised; they could be from anywhere (or so they hope). They take their cues from the Guardian\u2019s listing pages, rather than TNT. They strive to make English friends, are wary of other Australians and drink proper warm beer in proper English pubs. The past isn\u2019t erased, exactly but this tribe doesn\u2019t want to draw attention to their nationality. They take on that particularly English characteristic: they don\u2019t want to stand out. In their reinvention you can often detect a violent rejection of all things Australian. To have a drink in an outback-themed pub isn\u2019t just a simple nostalgic exercise but the prime symptom of some deep character flaw, an inability to let go of the homeland and fully participate in the new place. Needless to say - each group is embarrassed by the other. Sometimes the worlds collide. The globalised Australian might have a cousin in town, weepy and needy, wondering why she travelled to London, and why it\u2019s so cold and everyone is so rude. The cousin, comfortable only traveling on the Piccadilly Line and yearning for home, will want to meet at the Walkabout\u2013 the one place where she feels understood, and has her bearings. Her cousin will want to head south to Bermondsey to this fabulous Jamaican place he&apos;s read about. He was invited to the Walkabout once, to watch the AFL Grand Final, but even though he desperately wanted to see the game, his rejection of the Walkabout (and what it stood for) was too absolute to overcome. Those that assume there is no Australian class system might like to witness these fraught plans to meet for dinner. Although I didn\u2019t revisit the Covent Garden Walkabout, in other parts of the world, I have visited Australian-themed pubs. Usually I have been travelling on my own, and felt lonely. I go in hoping to find a kindred spirit, another Australian who\u2019s washed up on some strange distant shore. (Brussels, in the fishing village of Sagres in Portugal, in Amsterdam). Usually it\u2019s just some local guy behind the bar, who doesn\u2019t even care that you are from Australia. But travel weary and low, nursing your pint of Fosters in an empty bar under an Australian flag, while Men at Work sing of a land down under, can sometimes just be enough to remind yourself that you have a home.", "sentences": ["(Brussels, in the fishing village of Sagres in Portugal, in Amsterdam)."], "title": "The Walkabout: Australian home from home or national embarrassment?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/13/australia-cricket-walkabout-themed-pub", "tags": ["Pubs", "Australia cricket team", "Sport", "Cricket"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-06-13T11:32:47Z", "article": "Could it be time for the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational \u2013 and crucially Muppetational \u2013 Broadway show of all time? Reports in the US have suggested that the Muppets might be set for a live stage show. According to entertainment industry magazine Variety, Disney Theatrical Productions hosted an in-house trial performance last month at its New Amsterdam theatre, which has been dark since Mary Poppins shuttered in March. The aim was to explore the possibility of presenting Kermit and co in a live context given the constraints of the stage and audience sightlines. While the 15-minute performance, which featured 85 of the actual Muppets used in the recent film, was described by Disney Theatre Group&apos;s president Thomas Schumacher as &quot;a text of a concept,&quot; the organisation is renowned for pushing its development projects through. Variety reported that the showing had been deemed successful and predicts that the Muppets have enough popularity to make any such show a viable commercial possibility. Schumacher added that he was &quot;very intrigued&quot;. Alex Timbers, who is currently slated to direct the Broadway premiere of Rocky next year, had presented Schumacher with a concept for a potential Muppets stage show while working on the Tony award-winning Peter and the Starcatcher, a prequel to Peter Pan, last year. Any Broadway run is, however, a long way off. Aladdin is set to open at the New Amsterdam in 2014, four years after composer Alan Menken first admitted that he was working on the project.

At the start of 2013 the usual suspects were in force: wearable computing, big data, mobile advertising and even Facebook&apos;s fall from grace among a young generation re-evaluating their media needs. These predictions are often a classic case of overestimating short term change and underestimating the long term. But misses aside, the trend that really stood out for me was the growth in &apos;experience culture&apos;. In terms of social kudos, your shiny iPad has been displaced by the medieval-themed pop-up restaurant you found in a disused railway tunnel. Could immersive, technology-enhanced experiences just be the new social currency they promised us? In 2008, 100 players dashed across the city of Bristol, pursued by professionally made-up zombies. Cut to 2013 and Slingshot Effect&apos;s 2.8 Hours Later has six locations across the UK, six games in each city and a mooted US tour. And this is not exceptional. Since 2007, Secret Cinema has gradually grown its audience to a point where its month-long showing of Prometheus in 2012 raked in over \u00a3600,000. This was more than the same film made premi\u00e8ring at Britain&apos;s highest-earning screen, London&apos;s BFI IMAX. In a bid to support this kind of innovation and entrepreneurialism in the cultural sector, the government&apos;s Technology Strategy Board offers small scale funding opportunities through its ICTomorrow scheme. National Museums Scotland put forward an interesting brief: they wanted to partner with a games studio to explore playful ways of helping visitors engage with exhibits and their beautiful but complicated museum building. Chosen from 26 submissions, our Capture The Museum concept was inspired by classic board games like Risk and Trivial Pursuit, impressing National Museums Scotland with its simplicity and focus on the physical environment. It sees two teams roam the museum, competing to claim different galleries as their &apos;territory&apos;. More than a year later, the project we conceived with fellow Bristol gaming outfit Splash &amp; Ripple, launched in Edinburgh in May. Just as Secret Cinema changed the way devoted fans experience a film, Capture aims to add a competitive, narrative-driven layer to museum going. Overrun with cat videos and celebrity-bashing, the online world is cheap. Museums, by contrast, as well as being trustworthy institutions surrounded by beautiful architecture, are also packed with vibrant stories. Why shouldn&apos;t they provide an audience with their next experiential fix? For Capture to succeed at a time when the experiential bar is set so high, however, the game had to be &apos;heads-up&apos; \u2013 we didn&apos;t want visitors buried in their handsets; they can do that on the bus. And much as we wanted to push boundaries, museum goers do need pick-up-and-play simplicity. Face to face engagement with exhibits is what drives the game&apos;s pointscoring, while the app accompaniment logs scores and provides real-time updates. In the spirit of innovation, we developed in HTML5 and Javascript. This technology is far from the wonder solution it is held up to be but it does, in theory, allow the delivery of Apple and Android versions from the same codebase. Exclusive experiences can be a good thing, but not if they&apos;re only for the iPhone elite. Our fight to release on Android is ongoing \u2013 the fractured nature of the platform and the sheer range of devices makes it far from easy. Then there&apos;s the Wi-Fi issue. For this sort of immersive experience to unfold seamlessly, an institution must also address its ongoing infrastructure challenges. Attracting visitors with rich experiences to frame their museum engagement is all well and good, but being kicked off a flaky Wi-Fi network will quickly undo the hard work. Audiences expect connectivity wherever they go and as unsexy as it sounds, great projects live or die by how easy they are to get up and running. Despite its lengthy development, Capture couldn&apos;t have come at a better time. As belts tighten across the sector, talk is turning to revenue streams and sustainability. Amsterdam is one of many cities making a strong case in favour of paid entry. Following its 10-year closure for refurbishment, the entry-charging Rijksmuseum is enjoying mass public appreciation and queues around the block. David Cameron&apos;s approval ratings might not survive if he oversaw a reversal of Labour&apos;s famous pledge to make museums free in the UK, but there is a feeling that something needs to shift. Capture The Museum is currently free to play, on a sign-up basis, whenever National Museums Scotland staff choose to host the game. Though originally designed to gauge audience appetite for unconventional museum experiences, the familiar &apos;micro-payment&apos; system employed by free apps is one model that could fit. In a museum environment, where the content can sometimes overwhelm, games create a frame for exploration and risktaking. At its heart, Capture may be a glorified museum tour, but it combines technology and a little mischief to deliver a slice of the unexpected. Museum Lates are another strong, and current, example of the enthusiasm audiences have for cultural offerings with a twist.  The social angle casts the museum as a place for fun, not just somewhere for sandal-wearing swots and bookworms. Of all the predictions for 2013, it is the power of live, the gravity of immediacy, the seduction of the exclusive, the joy of face-to-face, that I predict will endure.

A travel alert, dated Monday 10 June on a Home Office letterhead, said carriers should not allow Snowden to board because &quot;the individual is highly likely to be refused entry to the UK&quot;. The Associated Press news agency saw a photograph of the document taken on Friday at a Thai airport. A British diplomat confirmed to AP that the document was genuine and was sent to airlines around the world. A Thai airline official also confirmed the alert had been issued. The official said such alerts were issued to carriers that flew into the UK, adding that any carrier bringing in Snowden would be liable to a \u00a32,000 fine. He said it was likely the Home Office had deemed Snowden&apos;s presence in the UK to be detrimental to the &quot;public good&quot;. The Home Office refused to confirm or deny the report, saying only: &quot;We do not comment on individual cases.&quot; Snowden, 29, has revealed himself as the source of top-secret documents about American NSA surveillance programmes that were reported earlier by the Guardian and Washington Post. He is believed to be in Hong Kong. The US citizen has not been charged with any crime and no warrants have been issued for his arrest. The alert was issued by the Risk and Liaison Overseas Network, part of the UK Border Agency, which has staff in several countries identified as major transit points for inadequately documented passengers. The document, titled &quot;RALON Carrier Alert 15/13&quot;, had a photograph of Snowden and gave his date of birth and passport number. It said: &quot;If this individual attempts to travel the UK: Carriers should deny boarding.&quot; Airlines allowing him to travel would &quot;be liable to costs relating to the individual&apos;s detention and removal&quot;, it said. According to the diplomat, carrier alerts are issued when the UK government wants to deny entry to people who don&apos;t normally need visas to enter the country, or whose visas were issued before something happened. He said the alerts were sometimes issued to deny convicted sex offenders entry to the UK. A Bangkok Airways officer said the airline was notified on Thursday about the alert by the Airports of Thailand, which operates national airports throughout the country. She said the notice was not intended to be seen by the public. British Airways was unable to comment on the alert. A member of staff referred the Guardian to the Home Office, adding: &quot;We comply with government requirements.&quot; Virgin Atlantic, which flies direct to London from Hong Kong, said it would not comment on security issues. It was not clear if governments in other countries had issued similar documents. However, Air France KLM, which connects China to Britain via the hubs in Paris and Amsterdam, said it had not received any alerts regarding Snowden. The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange criticised the move, describing Snowden as a hero. &quot;The British government should be offering Mr Snowden asylum, not excluding him from their borders. Edward Snowden is a hero \u2013 his revelations disclose something that is important to almost everyone in the world,&quot; said Assange, who has been inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London for almost a year. He is wanted in Sweden for questioning about allegations of sexual offences and has expressed fears that if returned to Sweden he could also face extradition to the US over the leaking of secret US logs on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. In Hong Kong, where a &quot;Support Snowden&quot; rally organised by human rights and other groups will march past the US consulate on Saturday afternoon, two pan-democratic lawmakers urged the US president to stop legal action against Snowden and consider letting him go. &quot;I&apos;m actually asking the United States not to even try to charge [Snowden],&quot; Claudia Mo Man-ching of the Civic party told the South China Morning Post on Friday. Mo and Gary Fan Kwok-wai of the NeoDemocrats have written an open letter to Barack Obama urging him to ensure &quot;national security&quot; claims are not used to justify abuse of state power. It argues: &quot;While we accept that Mr Snowden may be deemed to have contravened US law, we believe he may have done liberal democracy a service by stimulating serious discussion in many countries of the extent to which surveillance is acceptable in liberal, democratic societies \u2026 We urge you to tread very carefully and take account of the views of America&apos;s democratic friends around the world.&quot; Mo told the Guardian: &quot;The government should not keep secrets from the people. People should be able to keep some secrets from the government.&quot; Hong Kong&apos;s legislative council has said it will discuss the case at a meeting next Wednesday, following a request from lawmaker Ma Fung-kwok, who said the public needed more information on a possible surrender request from the US and Snowden&apos;s claims that the US hacked Hong Kong targets.

Sometime around 1986, the year that Kingsley Amis&apos;s The Old Devils was published, it became cool to grow old disgracefully. Age was to be resisted. Pensioners could dress like teenagers and, like teenagers, obsess about their sex lives. That lovely, dreadful old father played by Alan Arkin in the 2006 film Little Miss Sunshine summed up the new old. This was a dirty-talking grandpa in T-shirt, denim and leather, thrown out of his retirement home for\u00a0taking drugs. These days it seems the only people who are growing old with dignity \u2013 like real adults \u2013 are the Queen and Prince Philip. They don&apos;t wear trainers, they don&apos;t try to relive their youth or catch up on all they missed out on the first time around. They don&apos;t follow trends or burden their children with their emotional lives. The Queen hasn&apos;t even\u00a0changed her hairstyle since she became an adult. Into that admirable category, I would like to put my father. He died 18 months ago but, as time passes, he grows in my estimation not because of the love I feel for him but because he gave me something invaluable when I\u00a0was growing up. He\u00a0was an adult. Roy Mourby was a schoolmaster. Whenever he went out he wore a jacket and tie. He never wore a baseball cap or shorts. He never went to a Spinning class, disco or nightclub. He looked and behaved like an adult. He served in the Air Ministry during the second world war. He liked walking and singing in choirs (he had a\u00a0great Welsh bass voice). He also liked gardening, falling asleep in front of the television and bowling (of the outdoor variety). He could hold the attention of a room with one of his stories, but he also liked bad jokes of\u00a0the anecdotal kind, which he would insist were true (to the irritation of both my wives). Although he complained loudly about whichever government was in\u00a0power, he never once complained about his life in my hearing. Not when\u00a0he had to look after my mother as the two of them got frailer in their 80s, nor while he was dying of lung cancer, a result no doubt of the pipe and cigars he smoked. The last time I saw him, bedridden at home, I told him he was\u00a0very brave. &quot;My foot,&quot; he croaked, his voice almost gone. I asked if his foot was hurting. &quot;Brave?&quot; he said. &quot;My foot!&quot; My father believed he had had a good innings and was ready to go. He refused any intervention. He just wanted to be at home and be with my mother when he died. I wasn&apos;t there that day, but a cousin told me that he looked at my mother and told her he loved her. And she replied that she loved him too. Maybe sensing that it was all over, he repeated the words so she would have them to hold on to.\u00a0&quot;I.\u00a0Love. You.&quot; And then all the colour\u00a0left him and he was gone. And it has come as a surprise to me to realise I shall never measure up to him, not in ways that I consider important. He was always an adult to me. I never saw him show weakness. He loved my mother and, although he teased her too much, was devoted to\u00a0her. In the 1960s at least one of my friend&apos;s mothers made a pass at him (he was a very charming, good-looking man), but his reaction to this was one of surprise. Marriage was such an absolute for him that it was impossible to think outside that particular box and this made his gallantry to other women very attractive. My ex-wife found him so charming during our courtship that her mother once wondered out loud which of us was keener on her. My father&apos;s strength lay in his marriage. I never had to listen to him bemoaning his relationship issues as, sadly, my children ended up listening to mine. I never witnessed a divorce. If my father was a good husband, he was an even better parent and my daughter certainly sees him as the best grandfather there could be. He had an infinite amount of patience with children. He was a natural teacher but he also had a genuine delight in young people that my friends \u2013 and my friends&apos; children \u2013 responded to. Again his strength lay in the fact that he enjoyed the company of children but had no wish to be one. He didn&apos;t get down on his knees and play games, but he was liberal with \u00a35 notes that he handed out to his grandchildren \u2013 and their friends \u2013 because he remembered, growing up in\u00a0Wales, that generous uncles were the main source of teenage income. But\u00a0most of all, he was generous with his\u00a0time. I now believe that his own emotional stability was at the centre of this. He had time for you because he didn&apos;t need time for himself. My father did not have issues to work through. He had humour and charm, but he was always in charge. He never had a midlife crisis \u2013 or, if he did, he never told anyone. He didn&apos;t even confide that he was dying until it was obvious. I don&apos;t think my generation of men have been as good as husbands or parents (I am 57). All too often we have pursued our own happiness to the detriment of our children&apos;s lives. What was it that made this last generation of adults? My father and my mother were brought up by Victorians. They were loved as children but had rules and there were consequences if they broke them. They also had the second world war, which is not something I would wish on anyone, but before my father was 21 he was passing repaired aircraft as fit to fly. On one occasion he missed that a\u00a0vital fuel valve had been installed backwards and the engines cut out soon after takeoff. My father watched as the Wellington bomber crashed in front of him \u2013 it was entirely his fault. That degree of responsibility probably does make you grow up fast. That war also gave my parents something else. They were both so\u00a0grateful to have survived. I once asked my father, who had had a lot of ambitions in 1945 \u2013 in sport, education and politics \u2013 why he settled for such a\u00a0humdrum life after his marriage. In as\u00a0much as I could get him to be introspective, he admitted that having survived the war,\u00a0to have a wife, a home, a dog and a\u00a0son was life enough. That he was content with his lot bequeathed me a\u00a0lot of security. Introspection was not something my father entirely understood or respected. I remember my first wife discussing gender roles at the dinner table and my father announcing: &quot;Well, of course, in my day it was quite simple. The girls were the ones who danced backwards.&quot; There were a lot of modern ideas my father didn&apos;t think necessary to a happy life and one of them was travel (which is ironic given that I have spent most of my adult life travelling). Though my mother and I dragged him\u00a0to continental Europe, his ideal holiday destination was Welshpool. Nevertheless, he had a great capacity for delight once he had been persuaded to travel abroad. He would always congratulate us for insisting on Venice or Amsterdam over Aberystwyth. But I&apos;m sure in his heart he still thought the world had very little to offer when mid-Wales was on the doorstep. I miss him as Father&apos;s Day approaches, but it is a pleasant sense of missing. He had a long life, by his own standards a good life, and he left me with something very valuable. I\u00a0have a lot to live up to \u2013 when I finally grow up.", "sentences": ["He would always congratulate us for insisting on Venice or Amsterdam over Aberystwyth."], "title": "'I'll never measure up to my dad'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/15/i-will-never-measure-up-to-dad", "tags": ["Father's Day", "Parents and parenting", "Grandparents and grandparenting", "Bereavement", "Marriage", "Family", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-06-15T23:04:00Z", "article": "On the Praterstern, where cars, buses and trams converge from several busy streets on a road that loops around Vienna&apos;s central train station, a new digital counter stands under the eye of the Riesenrad Ferris wheel. It&apos;s about the size of a bus stop advertising hoarding and picks out passing bicycle wheels from a sensor in the pavement. With a rumpled grey overcoat over his suit and a cycling helmet covering his grey hair, Wolfgang Dvorak excitedly explains that the 2,072 figure on display marks the number of bicycles that have passed this point so far today. &quot;This is great, great! Measuring cyclists is making cycling visible, making people notice,&quot; says Dvorak. &quot;It&apos;s very important, especially at city crossings like this. Just 14 days ago it was done, and the marking of the cycle lane here and the cycle signing. This is showing people that Vienna is cycling.&quot; Dvorak, the director of last week&apos;s Velo-city, an annual conference that has brought more than 1,000 cycling experts and 330 speakers from around the world to Austria&apos;s capital, is giving an impromptu tour of the city&apos;s new bike-friendly spots, travelling by &quot;Citybike&quot; \u2013 a public bike rental system available at some 100 automatic stations around the streets. There are dozens of new private rental bike companies springing up too, including many specialising in e-bikes, electric-powered cycles for those more cautious about their fitness or ability levels, which can be charged for free at charging points across the capital. Vienna is in the middle not only of its own &quot;Year of Cycling&quot;, but also of an ambitious five-year plan to tempt its citizens out of cars and on to saddles. Faced with ever-growing traffic, as well as unenviable pollution levels and the rising costs of fuel, the city has determined to learn from progressive cycling capitals such as Munich, Malmo, Copenhagen and Amsterdam, which have embraced biking culture. Vienna is one of 60 cities to have signed up to the Charter of Brussels, which commits them to promoting cycling and setting clear targets in road safety and in achieving a 15% &quot;modal share&quot; \u2013 the percentage of trips made by bicycle out of the total number of trips made by city-dwellers. In the UK only Bristol and Edinburgh, which holds its first festival of cycling this weekend, have signed up, but the interest from mainland Europe, including many in the east, is phenomenal. &quot;We have now in Vienna about 5% to 6% modal share,&quot; says Dvorak. &quot;We aim to double that by 2015. We are working on many infrastructure changes to facilitate urban cycling. The situation in general is that we are a growing population and we have no room any more. We need to create space and stop congestion, air pollution. Look at these terrible floods we are seeing at the moment; it is no longer an option to ignore climate change.&quot; The television news in Austria and neighbouring Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany is full of images of flooded homes and businesses, and the Danube and Elbe have swollen with record levels of rainfall. Whatever the meteorologists and scientists say is the cause of the unseasonal weather, people here are talking and worrying about climate change. It is being reflected in the housing being built. Sustainability is a key factor and new developments are being planned around not just energy use but also the times of journeys to work and access to cycle networks. For people living in cities, space to park a bike securely can be a major obstacle, which is why Vienna has just completed a pilot project called Bike City \u2013 a block of 100 flats for middle-income people, with wide communal hallways and lifts with bike racks outside each front door and bike stores on every floor. Michael Szeiler, an Austrian traffic planning expert, is one of the first residents to have moved in. &quot;The rents here are affordable because the builders have saved money by not having car parking \u2013 they have built only 50 spaces, rather than one per flat, as is usual. People still have cars,&quot; he says, &quot;but people who live here make 25% of all trips by bicycle, as opposed to 6% of other Viennese.&quot; Szeiler has been working on projects to link residential areas by cycle. At hotspots, traffic lights set with detectors are programmed to tell when cars are coming and to give priority for cyclists, so that they do not have to keep stopping and starting their journeys. The city is investing in infrastructure, the second main shopping street is being made car free, with pedestrian and cycle shared zones, and local politicians point to the fact that at \u20ac4.5m (\u00a33.8m) it is only 5% of the annual road budgets. Maria Vassilakou is the deputy mayor of Vienna with responsibility for urban planning. &quot;Vienna is the fastest-growing city within German-speaking Europe, and if we continue with the policy of one person, one car, then we will become one traffic jam,&quot; she says. &quot;Cycling is about reducing congestion and creating space. We have set ambitious targets, especially in a city where you never know what the weather will be, but it is crucial to our survival to double the number of people cycling by 2015. It is crucial to make a swift change to modern mobility, and all ways lead to the bicycle.&quot; She admits that some moves have been controversial \u2013 the city intends ripping out parking spaces to make space for cycle lanes, and they also mix pedestrians and bikes in the same spaces. &quot;This is a hot issue&quot; she says, &quot;but in every city in the world there is conflict between cycling and cars, and you have to work hard at convincing people that their daily lives will improve. We have to be creative. We also have to encourage people to be respectful of each other.&quot; But the arguments in favour of cycling have convinced many younger Austrians, among whom bicycles are becoming trendy, with a burgeoning market for old and especially notable bikes. They are also becoming collectable, and Vienna has an exhibition, Tour du Monde, opening this weekend in the Museum of Applied Arts (MAK). MAK curator Thomas Geisler has chosen 50 examples from a collection of more than 210 bicycles owned by Michael Embacher, an architect with a pop star&apos;s standing in Austria. The selected machines are classics of design and very much of their time, says Geisler. &quot;Each bicycle is a smart product of contemporary times, following all the material developments of the 21st century, the innovation and the techniques. They all have a story to tell. The bicycle is a machine for perception, slowing you down through a city.&quot; Old bikes are turning up in Vienna&apos;s growing number of cycling shops, too, says Andrzej Felcak at the Radlager cycling cafe, showing a 20-year-old racer with a \u20ac1,200 (\u00a31,020) price tag. Felcak is the chairman of Argus Radlobby  \u2013 an organisation that campaigns for cycling in Austria, lobbying for better routes and security. &quot;Its a thing that&apos;s really growing, bike collectors. For some it&apos;s maybe a nostalgia for the bike they wanted as a kid but they couldn&apos;t afford it then, like the old racing bikes or the Chopper. &quot;For the cycling community in Vienna, it is wonderful to see trends in urban cycling being reflected more widely so that the bike is becoming a mainstream method of transport. We can&apos;t solve our problems with cars. &quot;We want to push now the concept of cargo bikes, as they have in Copenhagen, for shop deliveries and also for making sales in the streets.

But the airport said a rejection of its proposals could consign a generation to economic stagnation. Heathrow said it was still considering its options before the deadline of 19 July for submissions to the government-appointed airports commission, but indicated that schemes for three or four-runway models could be put forward. It said that competing with rival hubs such as Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol and Madrid would require having similar capacity of up to 800,000 flights a year, which would equate to a daily average of about 2,000 takeoffs and landings, compared with 1,288 at Heathrow in 2012. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow&apos;s development director, said the airport &quot;couldn&apos;t rule out&quot; public funding for its plans, depending on the findings of the commission. The airport has previously been keen to stress that expansion would be paid for by private investment. But Holland-Kaye said it would still be cheaper than alternatives at Stansted in Essex or the Thames estuary. &quot;It&apos;s fairly intuitive that there would be greater need for taxpayer support going east,&quot; he said. The London mayor, Boris Johnson, has put the bill for a new hub at \u00a370-80bn, including public funding of \u00a325bn. A Heathrow report titled Best Placed for Britain noted that 202 of the UK&apos;s top 300 companies had headquarters within 25 miles of its site, compared to seven for Stansted and two for a possible Thames estuary airport. It said twice as many people lived within an hour&apos;s journey of Heathrow, whether by car or public transport. Heathrow warned against assuming that the jobs it sustained could be easily transplanted or that the site would quickly be regenerated if the airport was replaced. It pointed to the decades that elapsed while even prime central London locations such as Battersea and Bankside power stations lay unused, while Hong Kong airport is yet to be redeveloped after 15 years. The airport is increasingly confident that the political debate has turned. Holland-Kaye said: &quot;The mood has changed. The economic downturn has brought a bit of a reality shock, encouraging people to think about how we can rebuild the economy in the short term, and plan long-term to remain an economic powerhouse.

But when Rienk van Grondelle looks at the same view, he envisages something completely different. Where farmers now grow vines or corn to feed animals, he sees a future landscape dotted with red ponds. The ponds would teem with red algae for the production of &quot;biofuels&quot; \u2013 gases and vegetable oils made from organic waste that are considered a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, because when burned they release less greenhouse gases than fossil fuels. One day, van Grondelle speculates, ethanol and butanol will be produced not only from algae but directly from artificial leaves. &quot;They would look pretty much like normal leaves, only you won&apos;t find them on a tree,&quot; he says. They would probably not even be green, he adds, but would perform the same task as natural plants: capturing light energy and transforming it into chemical energy. Biofuels are considered a viable alternative to fossil fuels because they can be integrated into the present industrial and transportation system: they can be combined with conventional fuels without revolutionising our supply infrastructures. However, conventional biofuels such as palm oil and sugar cane have had substantial environmental impacts, especially in terms of land use. Forests and agricultural land all over the world have been converted to biofuel production, creating problems with loss of biodiversity and feeding local communities. A new generation of biofuels made from engineered plants capable of more energy-efficient photosynthesis may help to solve the problem, because they would require less space to obtain the same amount of energy and if implemented at a domestic level they would save resources now used for transportation. Van Grondelle, professor of biophysics at VU University Amsterdam, has devoted his life to that crucial moment when light hits a leaf&apos;s surface and triggers a chemical reaction to produce carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water. &quot;Photosynthesis is amazingly efficient: it uses very simple molecules to exploit the power of light. And this happens in an infinitesimal fraction of a second.&quot; This is what his research, and the last 30 years of his life, have been all about. &quot;I am trying to understand what triggers the process and how it&apos;s regulated, so we can learn lessons from nature, mimic it in a solar device and eventually improve it.&quot; The great advantage of harvesting light through photosynthesis rather than photovoltaic technology, says van Grondelle, is that 80% of the world&apos;s energy consumption is still based on fuels. Another advantage of biofuels is that you can store them for later use, whereas the electricity generated by solar and wind power is intermittent. &quot;That&apos;s exactly what plants do through photosynthesis: they store energy for you.&quot; Since the 1970s, when van Grondelle joined the biophysics group in Leiden as a PhD student, the study of photosynthesis has made great progress. As a result we now have a complete picture of how energy from light is captured by chlorophyll pigments in the cells of a leaf&apos;s surface and passes through a sequence of molecules like an electric discharge. These molecules harness the energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and chemical fuel \u2013 food. &quot;Now we can engineer these complexes and figure out, relying on experiments, what changes need to be done to improve their structure and make them better,&quot; says van Grondelle. &quot;We can modify a surface enabling it to capture a wider [range] of the light&apos;s spectrum. This way, the process produces more energy.&quot; He points out that plants and algae have evolved to produce only enough energy to live and reproduce. &quot;For example, if you calculate the energy return on investment of a plant, say a tree, you will see that it is not very efficient.&quot; The first step to solve this efficiency problem is to study very simple organisms such as algae. Photosynthesis in algae is a lot more efficient than that in plants, and you can more easily genetically engineer them to enhance their ability to capture light and convert it into chemical energy. Van Grondelle admits that it remains difficult to calculate the ultimate efficiency of a photosynthesis-based power plant while research is ongoing, but the plan is to be producing ethanol and butanol at a competitive price within 10 years. In 2010 the European Research Council provided his team with \u20ac3m of funding to investigate the role of proteins bound to chlorophyll in the efficiency of photosynthesis. The objective is an efficient way to make biofuels that could support a cleaner transportation system and replace natural gas in the domestic supply. He doesn&apos;t claim that his research alone can save the world. &quot;I believe the solution for the world&apos;s growing energy demand has got to be a combination of different technologies and political strategies.&quot; But the price of meeting the rise in global energy demand may be very different urban and rural landscapes. &quot;It might be difficult to imagine,&quot; Grondelle concedes, &quot;but in a civilised society it is already widely accepted to use land for meat production or industrial agriculture.&quot;  Once the technology has been implemented on agricultural land, he says, it could be rolled out across the urban environment. &quot;Every backyard may have a pond, or a tank, where algae are grown for domestic energy supply.&quot; Lou Del Bello is a freelance journalist from Italy with a background in environmental issues.

Figures show that as many as 54% of Dutch households live in rented accommodation, with only 13% renting from private landlords. The negativity associated with social housing in the UK does not exist in the Netherlands, where the reality is that almost everyone has a friend, or parent or grandparent, living in social housing. In fact, it is estimated that in most major Dutch cities in the 2000s, social housing accounted for more than half the population&apos;s housing tenure. Like most of European countries, the Netherlands is now taking a good, hard look at its housing policies. One of the ideas under consideration is whether shared ownership, an uncommon but not unheard of model in the country, could cross-subsidise other social housing tenures if appropriately targeted at different groups of purchasers. Evidently, this issue of making subsidy go further is as relevant to Dutch housing providers as it is for us. Influenced by fiscal constraints, combined with a move towards a more populist rhetoric about &quot;scroungers&quot;, housing allocations in the Netherlands have become more targeted and less universal \u2013 similar to how British social housing allocations changed in the 1970s. The most recent Dutch coalition agreement specifically states that the social housing sector will have to allocate housing by needs, with the most in need of social housing at the top of the queue, and encourage others in the social sector to move. As a result of this, in 2011, at least 90% of housing association dwellings were allocated to people with an annual household income of less than \u20ac33,614 (\u00a328,800), a significant shift from previous years when access to social housing was less about income and more about equality. Yet while the UK government looks to introduce a pay-to-stay policy, under which high-earning social tenants will be forced to pay market rent to stay in their social homes, its Dutch counterparts are taking a slightly different approach. As part of the coalition agreement, Dutch households renting from the social sector with an annual income of less than \u20ac43,000 will not see their rent increase by more than the rate of inflation. But if a household earns more, the rent will increase by up to the rate of inflation, plus 5%. This policy will act as a major disincentive to those people who want to stay in their homes but are also working to improve their financial prospects. To put it simply, a blunt instrument is being used to deal with a delicate situation. The Dutch may therefore find that alternatives, such as shared ownership, start to look increasingly attractive. Obviously, not all the issues facing our two countries are the same. However, we do share many similarities. For example, the UK, like the Netherlands, is characterised by strong regional price differences \u2013 for both owners and renters \u2013 and Amsterdam, like London, is an expensive city that often struggles to accommodate low-income earners. It&apos;s encouraging to see our Dutch peers also looking at new and innovative ways to cross-subsidise social housing, especially as there appears to be a Europe-wide appetite for new ideas that work in times of austerity. Whether following Britain&apos;s lead on social housing provision will be good for a nation with a stronger dependence on rented housing remains to be seen.

The airline&apos;s pre-tax loss widened from \u00a36.2m to \u00a340.7m in the year to 31 March, as the airline undergoes a cost-saving plan that includes slot sales and 500 redundancies. Its UK business continued to decline, recording a 1% fall in passengers to 7.2 million. French said air passenger duty (APD) tax had compounded the problems brought by the economic downturn, which was particularly harsh in the regional markets. He said: &quot;We&apos;ve had to endure the totally unacceptable burden of APD, which is now 18% of our ticket prices.

The arresting statistic formed from a mass census of cyclists in London \u2013 apparently the biggest of its kind to date \u2013 is adding weight to campaigners&apos; and cycling proponents&apos; arguments that the bicycle is no longer the transport of the minority, and that we need to take the bicycle seriously as a means of mass transport. The numbers on some headline routes are perhaps not surprising to anyone who has squashed in with scores of cyclists at the traffic lights in London&apos;s morning rush hour, though they do make previous cycling targets look shamefully unambitious. At Theobalds Road near Holborn, bikes were 64% of all vehicles heading west, while Elephant and Castle, one of London&apos;s most notoriously frightening roundabouts for cyclists (which Boris Johnson once said was &quot;fine&quot; for cyclists) saw 903 cyclists per hour head north to the city centre between 7am and 9am. Unsurprisingly, the bridges score well (they are the only way for cyclists to cross the river). London Bridge, for example, averaged 660 bikes an hour over the whole day (6am to 8pm), or 47% of vehicles. In Amsterdam, meanwhile, 60% of inner city traffic is bikes. And yet spending on cycling in London is still a tiny portion of the transport budget. London&apos;s new cycling commissioner, Andrew Gilligan, told the Guardian: &quot;Cycling is clearly a mass mode of transport in central London and until now it hasn&apos;t been treated as such. &quot;Nearly all provision for cycling is based on the presumption that hardly anyone cycles, that you can make do with shoving cyclists to the side of the road and that just clearly is wrong. Since Johnson&apos;s cycling vision was launched in March, there have been fears that the proposed \u00a3913m funding for cycling will suffer at the hands of George Osborne&apos;s spending review, due tomorrow. Gilligan remains optimistic, however, and says although the money is a lot more than previously spent on cycling, it&apos;s not a lot compared to TfL&apos;s overall budget. As Sir Peter Hendy, TfL&apos;s transport commissioner, noted at the cycling vision&apos;s City Hall launch, we get more for our money from cycling infrastructure than for other mass transport systems. He wants to make cycling &quot;one of his highest priorities&quot;. As campaigners point out, urban cycling is still dominated by a minority. The next goal is surely to get everyone else on a bike. The London Cycling Campaign&apos;s chief executive, Dr Ashok Sinha, said:  &quot;The latest cycling figures from TfL simply underline that, given the right circumstances, a large proportion of London&apos;s population would opt to cycle to work.  &quot;The ultimate goal must be to enable people of all ages and backgrounds to feel safe enough to cycle for everyday local journeys, not just commuters. The good news is that Boris Johnson gets this and understands that investing in cycling saves money in the long run. That&apos;s why he must resolutely defend his impressive new cycling programme from impending Treasury cuts.&quot;  If this many people can get on their bikes in London&apos;s cramped, crowded streets, it seems the sky&apos;s the limit.

Photograph: Joe Bangay/BA/LFI    My last album helped me beat cancer. I think that had a lot to do with it. It&apos;s like, before you had the album, you are yesterday&apos;s news, and even though you are still breathing, it&apos;s harder to breathe, &apos;cos what keeps you alive is people noticing you&apos;re still doing something. Stevie Wonder knew how to open a show. When I first started recording, years ago, I opened up for Stevie in Los Angeles. I took the attitude that this was my shot, so I went for it. But then Stevie did something I never saw him do \u2013 he came out and played opera for about an hour on his keyboard. No, not that long! But for about 15 minutes \u2026 and then as people were trying to figure out where he was coming from, he broke into [sings intro to Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I&apos;m Yours]. Some guys wait 15 minutes to cool it off before they go on. But Stevie came right out and started playing classical music \u2026 I never forgot that. I&apos;ve played on the Pyramid stage, but the size of the stage don&apos;t matter. It&apos;s the people there that matter. I was with Gorillaz when they headlined Glastonbury in 2010. The stage can be ever so big but I like smaller stages. You get closer to the people than you do singing somewhere where people are just watching you on TV.     Womack performing live in Amsterdam in 1976. Photograph: Gijsbert Hanekroot/Redferns    I used to do some crazy things onstage. One time I jumped off the stage on to a\u00a0platform below. But it was a fake platform. I went right through that thin\u00a0cardboard and into a garage somewhere. I was wearing a white suit and when I came out that suit was black. It scared me to death, though. I\u00a0remember them bringing me back on \u2026 I had broken my ankle or something, it wasn&apos;t time to try and be cool! The people just rolled laughing. They were saying: &quot;Look, he went downstairs to change clothes!&quot; The Rolling Stones are survivors, like me. I know so many artists I grew up with in the music business that are no longer here. Yesterday I found out that a guy I really admired, Bobby Bland, passed away. It upset me because it&apos;s hard to get used to seeing somebody one day and the next day they&apos;re no longer here. I won&apos;t be walking around the crowd at Glastonbury. It&apos;s disrespectful to who&apos;s performing. They&apos;ll say: &quot;Hey, look at Womack, oh man!&quot; Then they come and start asking for autographs. You&apos;re distracting the audience from whoever is up there performing. I&apos;d never do that. Marvin Gaye never got complacent. He said to me once: &quot;Bobby, I like recording, but I don&apos;t like performing \u2026 when I walk out on stage I don&apos;t care how they react, if they&apos;re cheering or whatever, I\u00a0can&apos;t relax for the first two or three songs.&quot; I said, well, that&apos;s a good thing, because you can go to sleep. I&apos;ve seen it happen with a lot of cases, professional boxers, whoever \u2026 they get too confident and get knocked out. I always say: &quot;They throw me on stage and they throw me off!&quot; I get so carried away, I carry on singing \u2026 once I played for two and a half hours. I always say to my guy, please let me know I gotta get off 15 minutes before, because I hate to rush. Give me a flashlight or something. Because I never want to get into a place where they say: &quot;He wouldn&apos;t come off!&quot; Mick Jagger hasn&apos;t slowed down. I don&apos;t think he ever will. You gotta take care of what keeps you going. If he slows down, he&apos;ll slow out. I will never miss a show again. Once I\u00a0was somewhere in the south and had to catch a cab to a show that was about 100 miles away. I said: &quot;Do you think you can get me there to perform?&quot; He was driving like a crazy person because I paid him quite a bit of money to get there on time. I remember when he pulled up, I could hear the band playing the opening song. I said: &quot;Open the door! Let me out!&quot; and I ran right out of the cab and up on stage. The toilets at Glastonbury don&apos;t worry me. When I put on my outfit and leave the plane station, I come to work. I&apos;m open to anything. There ain&apos;t nothing else that distracts me other than the feeling that I gotta go on stage. The toughest crowd I ever played was in the days after Sam Cooke passed away. I was Sam&apos;s guitar player, and after he died I married his wife. I\u00a0thought: &quot;OK, if I&apos;m going to be there all the time to be his guardian angel, I\u00a0might as well marry her and give him a reason to talk.&quot; But people went nuts. They went nuts! I used to get so many letters and so many threats. I came into Chicago for one show, and the crowd wouldn&apos;t applaud. They wouldn&apos;t do anything \u2013 they just sat there. I thought: &quot;Why did they come to see me?&quot; but they were just very curious and very upset. That bothered me the most because I highly respected Sam Cooke and I loved him. If anything had kept me away from being a musician it would have been this \u2026 but I never stopped. I kept moving on, and as I moved on I learned that things change. Now, I get people coming up to me and saying: &quot;I love you, and I&apos;m a big Sam Cooke fan.&quot; When you&apos;ve been doing something 50 years, you don&apos;t get nervous. (Laughs) You really don&apos;t, you just gotta try and keep your interest in what you gotta do because once you lose interest in that, it&apos;s time to quit. But I&apos;ve been doing this a long time, I&apos;m way past getting nervous. The only time I get nervous is when I&apos;ve got no work. When they say: &quot;Well, nobody called about no date&quot; \u2026 that&apos;s when I\u00a0get nervous! I walk on stage as curious as the people.

The look of the site will not set design hearts racing but it is easy to use with fast maps allowing you to see the collection of properties in each destination at a glance \u2013 a simple function surprisingly few sites offer. Each property has a detailed description, comprehensive list of amenities and, unusually, a floor-plan of the apartment. The site&apos;s instant-booking feature means clients don&apos;t have to wait for a response from the apartment owner: the booking is made through Only Apartments in real time and the client and host receive a confirmation email straightaway. \u2022 Sample propertiesAmsterdam: This modern one-bed apartment \u2013 complete with a shower/bath area featuring a wall of plants \u2013\u00a0is in the Jordaan area, and close to the city centre.

You&apos;re ideally placed for the best of the city&apos;s restaurants and nightlife Best for variety AirbnbLaunched in 2008, San Francisco-based Airbnb is now the largest site of its kind with 340,000 listings spanning the full range of private accommodation, from rooms in shared apartments to private islands, like this 10-acre Fijian island for up to 10 guests (yours for \u00a3338 a night), or an island escape on Spain&apos;s Costa Brava. Airbnb&apos;s impact on the way we travel has been huge, so much so that city authorities are starting to clamp down on private rentals. In New York a law passed in 2010 to crack down on &quot;bad actors that operate illegal hotels&quot; recently lead to a ruling against a landlord who was fined $2,400 after his tenant Nigel Warren rented a bedroom in his East Village apartment for three days. There was confusion at the time the law was introduced as to exactly what it meant for companies such as Airbnb, but as Airbnb has made clear, it&apos;s not illegal to rent out an apartment. Airbnb is now helping Warren and his landlord fight the ruling. Airbnb&apos;s reach extends worldwide and it probably has more variety than any other site. The number of properties is overwhelming, especially when you search in popular cities but the clean look of the site makes sifting through them less daunting, and you can filter your search by price, neighbourhood, type of property and amenities.. Guests and hosts liaise directly with one another, and the time it takes to book depends on the hosts who either list their property as &quot;Instant book or opt to respond within 24 hours&quot;. Bookings pass through Airbnb and the host does not receive payment for 24 hours giving guests time to call Airbnb should there be problems with their booking. \u2022 Sample propertiesParis: A new studio apartment in Paris&apos;s atmospheric Saint Germain district, this recently redesigned property sleeps two, and costs from \u00a3512 a week; Fiji: Not just any three-bedroom property, this is a private island escape in Fiji \u2013 on the 10-acre Nanuku Island to be precise.

The site allows you to search by neighbourhood or accommodation type; or search the recommendations section by type of traveller including families, culture-lovers, LGBT, wheelchair users and &quot;fashion finders&quot; with a list of relevant tips for each category, although annoyingly none of the tips has an address or link to the websites. It features suggestions for things to do and see \u2013 under the local tips section on the homepage \u2013 but again, with no useful detail (address/website) it&apos;s of limited use. Ironing out these glitches would improve the site but credit goes to the pick of apartments, which are smart, contemporary, &quot;boutique-style&quot; pads that will make a great base for exploring these cities. \u2022 Sample propertiesBerlin: Berlin&apos;s culturally rich Kreuzberg district is the location for this affordable family-orientated three-bedroom apartment, with balcony.

One Fine Stay launched in 2010 with a selection of upmarket London homes. In 2012 it crossed the pond, adding a New York collection. Now it has a total of 1,000 properties, with an even split between houses and apartments. Its relatively small size makes it much easier to narrow down your search, though there are plans to add other destinations in future. For most holidaymakers the big attraction with renting is that it&apos;s cheaper than staying in a hotel. That is not the case with One Fine Stay. Living in the lap of luxury doesn&apos;t come cheap. In London prices range from \u00a3150 a night to over \u00a31,000 a night for a stately apartment overlooking Hyde Park; in New York prices start from $200 a night and go up to $2,699 a night. One Fine Stay also offers service levels above and beyond the majority of players in the market, managing everything from the booking (which you can do instantly online or by phone through the 24/7 reservations team) to supplying linens and meeting guests on arrival. Once there guests are given an iPhone for free local calls, and apartments are cleaned weekly.

Today, the company has swish offices in London, features 206,629 properties in 26,000 destinations, and is growing \u2013 by about 2,500 properties a week. Over 50% of guests travel as part of a family holiday. Bertrand was inspired to create Housetrip after he tried to book an apartment in Edinburgh and found the experience so frustrating, so he prides himself on Housetrip&apos;s service and ease of use: highlighting that it is six clicks from &quot;looking to booking&quot;. Bookings are with the company rather than the owner, who isn&apos;t paid until two days after your stay. If you do have problems, the Lisbon-based customer service line is available round the clock. Housetrip is the only rental site to offer a loyalty programme where, if you buy 10 nights, you get one night of your next booking free. \u2022 Sample propertiesLisbon: In the heart of the Baixa area and offering views of Rossio Square and Bairro Alto, this family-aimed apartment in the Portuguese capital has two bedrooms and costs from \u00a3113 a nightDubrovnik: If you&apos;re planning a group getaway then the six en suite bedrooms of Villa Gradi may fit the bill.

Among its 5,000 places to stay there are just 300 apartments in Europe, a mix of pure self-catering and apartments that are part of hotels or B&amp;Bs. A smattering of them are city pads but most are in the countryside so are good options for a summer holiday, as opposed to a city break. \u2022 Sample propertiesCatania: Designed by its architect-owner, this two double-bedroom (both en suite) apartment is next to Catania&apos;s 13th-century castle and close to its city centre restaurants and bars.

Most of those are in rural, rather than city locations, but they are all interesting properties. Each property has general description and a list of amenities, both local and in the property itself, and customer comments are included too. Customers book directly with the owners and One Off Places takes an arm&apos;s length approach to any problems that might arise. While it will take down any properties that are advertising themselves fraudulently, or where service is not up to scratch, it takes no responsibility for problems with the booking and offers no guarantees or protection once you have booked the property. \u2022 Sample propertiesRio de Janeiro: The views from this 13th-floor apartment take in the whole of Copacabana, and if you need more convincing it has its own hot tub on the terrace.

The site looks fresh, listing key city and holiday destinations on the homepage, as well as popular apartments. Wimdu holds onto your money for the first 24 hours of your stay, ensuring that the property meets the guest&apos;s expectations. If it differs drastically from the description the customer service team will source an alternative property in the area and recoup payment from the original host. \u2022 Sample propertiesChania, Crete: On the promenade of Crete&apos;s second largest city, this one-bed apartment&apos;s balcony offers sea and mountain views.

How you book, whether through Holiday Lettings, or direct to the owner by Paypal or credit card varies by property, but each listing features either a payment-protection badge, meaning hosts are only paid 48 hours after travellers have checked in, or a verified-owner badge, meaning owners have been vetted and checked by Holiday Lettings. \u2022 Sample propertiesIslington, London: From \u00a358 a night, this urban-cool flat in Angel, Islington, is good for couples or families \u2013 with a cot and highchair available.

This room in the Beninese artist&apos;s Museum of Contemporary African Art is full of wedding souvenirs, from photographs to gifts, that record his marriage to a Dutch curator in a ceremony at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Art or life? It was both. And today, that joyous conflation of reality with the cool precincts of a museum is commemorated in a soppy wedding video and love tokens displayed as museum artefacts in London&apos;s Tate Modern. It got me hooked on the strange and wonderful nature of Gaba&apos;s enterprise. At the Museum of Contemporary African Art you can sit on sofas and read books, play a piano, see Ghanaian money with Picasso&apos;s face on it, or visit a Swiss bank that looks like an African street market. Through an epic assembly of often poignant stuff runs a confessional thread, as the artist narrates his journey through the world of modern art, between Africa and Europe and back again. In the Library, where books on a vast range of modern art are available to consult, you can hear about Gaba&apos;s childhood, how he drew all over his reading books. His passion for art eventually led him to study at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam. Personal information is not extraneous to this exhibition \u2013 it&apos;s an unavoidable part of it.     Meschac Gaba's Music Room, part of his Museum of Contemporary African Art. Photograph: Nils Klinger    Museums can be autobiographies, or novels. The Museum of Contemporary African Art is a bit of both. But it is also a protest. Where is the African art of today in European and American museums? The Art and Religion Room juxtaposes reproductions of &quot;classic&quot; African religious sculpture with tacky Christian and Buddhist artefacts. The stress that museums place on African ceremonial art of the past, this implies, is a bit like judging modern European art by kitsch replicas of Raphael Madonnas. Where, he asks, is the contemporary voice of Africa in our museums? It&apos;s here, in this powerful surrealistic anti-museum. The homemade quality of everything in the Museum of Contemporary African Art gives it a raw atmosphere of living cities. The excitement and complexity of our sprawling century seems to press at the doors. Traditionally, museums put art in a quiet world of its own.

The opening coincides with major retrospectives for the Sudanese artist Ibrahim El-Salahi, 82, and the Lebanese artist Saloua Raouda Choucair, 97. Both could be described as overlooked pioneers, and the shows reflect Tate Modern&apos;s move towards a more globalised view of art. &quot;These are all exhibitions that 20 or 30 years ago were quite impossible,&quot; said the Tate Modern director, Chris Dercon. &quot;At some point it will be absolutely normal and absolutely necessary to have all these kinds of work, all these artists, together in one museum.&quot;     A grand piano filled with chocolate coins by Gaba. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA    The acquisition of Gaba&apos;s enormous 12-room Museum of Contemporary African Art has been several years in the planning. &quot;I&apos;m very happy to have my work here,&quot; said Benin-born Gaba. &quot;Tate is a dream place, all artists would like to be here.&quot; He recalled being a student at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam and looking for somewhere to exhibit his work. The only place he found was the ethnographic museum, but it did not show contemporary art. So between 1997 and 2002 he created a museum. Gaba has filled his museum with things he wants. There is a games room where people can create African flags with sliding puzzle tables. On a few days during the work&apos;s display there will be a Tarot reader. There is also a music room, a humanist space and a marriage room where Gaba displays photos from his wedding in 2000 to curator Alexandra van Dongen. The installation has been part-acquired and part-gifted to Tate Modern \u2013 as in bought for an undisclosed discount. It opens free of charge on 3 July, next door to the El-Salahi display, which costs \u00a310 for entry and is the first major UK exhibition of his work.

Photograph: Barcroft Media    El-Salahi, widely regarded as the father of African modernism, had a landmark show at the ICA in 1963 and then &quot;suddenly in the 70s and 80s there was a decline in interest in African artists. The importance of this show is to fill gaps in the narrative and globalise the narrative.&quot; The show traces his artistic and personal life from studying in Khartoum to the Slade School of Fine Art in London, and his jailing in 1975, when he was wrongly accused of anti-government activities in Sudan and his subsequent exile to Oxford in 1998. &quot;I miss Sudan all the time but I also don&apos;t miss it because it is uppermost in my mind,&quot; he said. &quot;I am settled now, I&apos;ve put down roots.

Watch here Robyn and Snoop Dogg&apos;s riotous U Should Know Better first appeared on the Swedish pop goddess&apos;s Body Talk Part 2 EP back in September 2010, but was never released as a single. Almost three years later, and with the main Body Talk album having been released since, U Should Know Better is finally seeing the light of day accompanied by a long-in-the-works video featuring some gender swapping, a love scene involving dolls and some of the best dancing you&apos;ll see this side of a Robyn concert. Below we chat exclusively to Robyn about why she&apos;s decided to release the song and the video after all this time, plus above we&apos;re also premiering the brilliantly gonzo, drum clap-heavy Christian Falk remix, which makes the sweary original even more NSFW. &quot;Christian is my old friend,&quot; Robyn explains about how the remix came to be. &quot;He&apos;s a person I&apos;ve worked with ever since I started making music. We made songs together on my first album [1995&apos;s Robyn Is Here]. We work together back and forth every other year or so and he&apos;s just a very special person that I love to work with and I wanted him to remix the song. He&apos;s this 52-year-old guy who makes hip-hop beats in his basement that are better than most of the beats I hear.&quot; So, why is there a video for U Should Know Better almost three years after it was released on Body Talk?Hm, because me and Maria [Wahlberg, the director] just had a really good idea, that&apos;s the only reason. For me, I just thought it was a shame that I wasn&apos;t able to release the song as a single. I mean, I was, but I didn&apos;t because there were so many other singles and I had to stop releasing singles to be done with the album. I always felt it was a shame because I love that song and I love that Snoop is on it. Me and the director were just hanging out and talking about how our friend Pernilla looks so much like Snoop and then we just started brainstorming and I came up with the idea of finding a boy that looked like me and we just had fun with it. That was two years ago, so we&apos;ve been taking our time! News about you casting for the video emerged last March \u2013 why did it take so long for the actual finished video to come out?We had to find the money to do the video and it&apos;s Maria&apos;s first project so we didn&apos;t want to rush. Also, there&apos;s no album campaign to stay up to speed with so it was just a fun project for ourselves, but I still have a connection to the record and a connection to the people who are listening to it.  Was Snoop ever going to be in the video?We talked about it and he&apos;s been really supportive. I&apos;ve showed him all the treatments and all the ideas and he okayed everything. At one point we were going to have him in the video, and he was up for it, but we couldn&apos;t find the money to fly him over because you know he has a big entourage. We were thinking of maybe flying over to Amsterdam because he was going to be there on tour but then it didn&apos;t work out, scheduling wise. He was going to be the dad in the video and I was going to be the mum. Behind-the scenes videos of the making of videos are often a bit pointless, but the one for U Should Know Better is amazing. At one point you go round to the boy who plays you in the video&apos;s parent&apos;s house and have a cup of tea. Yes. We cast him and then it took almost a year until we made the video and we stayed in touch with him and he was like &quot;When is it going to happen?&quot; and was so excited \u2013 then nothing happened and we just felt awful. But we stayed in touch so it was really nice to go to his house and meet his parents. I think fans thought the video was some sort of prelude to you releasing some new songs.No [she laughs heartily at this]. You&apos;re laughing as if you&apos;ve only just started working on a new album. Is that the case?(Still laughing) Yeah. I mean, I&apos;ve started working again. I don&apos;t know what it will be \u2013 it&apos;s too early to say if it&apos;s going to be an album, or an EP. I don&apos;t even know if it&apos;s going to be my own music. We shall see. I see people messaging me on my Twitter and sometimes I feel bad because I&apos;m nowhere near finished with the album \u2013 it&apos;s probably going to be a while before you hear anything new from me.U Should Know Better is out on 7 July.", "sentences": ["We were thinking of maybe flying over to Amsterdam because he was going to be there on tour but then it didn&apos;t work out, scheduling wise."], "title": "Robyn feat Snoop Dogg - U Should Know Better (Christian Falk Remix): New music", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/jul/02/robyn-snoop-dogg-u-should-know-better", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Robyn", "Pop and rock"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-07-05T10:35:54Z", "article": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho personally assured Marco van Ginkel that he would be granted significant first-team football with Chelsea to convince the Holland international to swap Vitesse Arnhem for the Premier League, with the young midfielder completing a \u00a39m move to Stamford Bridge on Friday. Van Ginkel, who made his senior international debut against Germany last November, was a key member of the Vitesse side who finished fourth in the Eredivisie last season, their highest placing since 1998, and was voted the best young player in the Netherlands at the end of the campaign. Ajax declared an interest in taking him to Amsterdam earlier this summer and the 20-year-old&apos;s instinct was to make that step up before seeking a move at an elite club in either England or Spain. Indeed, the Dutch champions believed they were close to securing his services with the promise of an integral role in their lineup. &quot;Van Ginkel is a great young talent and we would have liked him to come to Ajax,&quot; said Marc Overmars, who is now sporting director at the Amsterdam ArenA club. &quot;Whether it is too early for him to go to Chelsea or not, I don&apos;t know. With us, he would have played a lot of games and played in the Champions League.&quot; But Mourinho spoke with the player and, much to Ajax&apos;s disappointment, convinced the youngster he would feature regularly rather than following the likes of other recent signings, such as Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, by continuing their development on loan elsewhere. The Portuguese considers Van Ginkel as the long-term successor to Frank Lampard in Chelsea&apos;s midfield and hopes he can learn from the veteran, who signed a one-year contract extension at the club back in May, within the senior set-up. Chelsea were always favourites to secure Van Ginkel \u2013 Manchester United were among a number of other clubs who had also tracked the player \u2013 as a result of their close relationship with Vitesse, born of the friendship between Roman Abramovich and the Dutch club&apos;s Georgian owner, Merab Jordania. The likes of Tomas Kalas, Patrick van Aanholt, Ga\u00ebl Kakuta and Nemanja Matic have spent time on loan in Arnhem, with the Londoners having watched Van Ginkel&apos;s progress with interest from afar. The midfielder joined Vitesse at the age of seven in 1999 and progressed through the youth ranks before making his Eredivisie debut at 17. He hopes to feature at the World Cup finals in Brazil, but to do that he must make an impact in the Chelsea first-team. Mourinho is confident he can be integrated: the player is comfortable in the 4-3-3 system the manager intends to implement, and boasts the physique and box-to-box energy and eye for goal that have drawn the inevitable comparisons with Lampard.

I think we added more dates&quot;), the two members of the band AlunaGeorge sit in a London park, replenishing energy. Aluna Francis, 24, prods at a takeaway tub from a local veggie place, forking up everything except unfancied chunks of beetroot. George Reid, also 24, smokes a roll-up. They make each other laugh remembering a promoter, met backstage at one or other of the festivals, who handed them a business card with his name, number and naked photograph on it.

At the start of the year they were listed as one of the BBC Sound of 2013; they were critics&apos; choice nominees at the Brits. Now, after months of bubbling interest, they&apos;re ready to release a debut album, Body Music, a dozen sunny, electronic tracks (including an entertaining cover of Montell Jordan&apos;s 1995 R&amp;B hit This is How We Do It) built around Aluna&apos;s vocals and George&apos;s beats. An infectious pairing. &quot;We&apos;re very fortunate to have met each other,&quot; says Aluna. &quot;I don&apos;t think everyone in creative partnerships enjoys this kind of harmony. You hear of animosity, big heads\u2026 I&apos;d worked with some weirdos in my time, so when I met George, I thought: I&apos;ll have this one! Making music with him is fun and actually relaxed.&quot; They were introduced about four years ago. Aluna, from Hertfordshire, had moved to London with the idea of becoming a musician or an artist. (Her specialism? &quot;Bad painting.&quot;) She had odd jobs selling T-shirts and working as a receptionist and she was the singer in a band, My Toys Like Me. George was living with his parents in Molesey, making music in his bedroom and hoping to build a name as a remixer. He was invited to work on tracks for My Toys Like Me. Shortly after that, George and Aluna embarked on what was, essentially, a professional affair \u2013 an extended musical fling. Aluna: &quot;I just found myself in his bedroom at some point.&quot; George: &quot;So we thought\u2026&quot; Aluna: &quot;While we&apos;re here\u2026&quot; George: &quot;Let&apos;s do some music on our own. And that was very easy and very fun. We believed the music was good. So we carried on.&quot; Every so often they get asked if they&apos;re a couple. &quot;It comes up,&quot; says Aluna. George blames early press shots in which she was draped\u00a0over\u00a0him. They&apos;re not together, just colleagues. Clearly good mates, too, which will help in the coming months. After their monster festival run, they&apos;ll tour on through September and October.

By making a phone that puts social values first, we hope to spark a movement of people and organisations that together work toward an economy based on fairer principles. We are part of initiatives that account for the true value of the phone&apos;s life, and produced in a way with minimal harm to people and the environment. In this way, Fairphone offers its buyers more than a smartphone. The phone is a beginning to change the way things are made and create systemic change in the industry. When we began three years ago, Fairphone was established as a campaign, a non-profit organisation with a mission to raise awareness on the relationship between conflict minerals and their electronic goods. We always knew that to make interventions in the supply chain, we needed to understand what lies behind the production of a mobile phone. To understand these processes, we needed to actually produce a phone. This is how the social enterprise started. While we were still in our phase of raising awareness, people (consumers, even phone operators) started asking us whether they could buy our phones. Although it wasn&apos;t until the beginning of this year that Fairphone received funding, enabling us to be established as a social enterprise, we had already identified a consumer market. For the year prior to our pre-order campaign, we opened up a subscribers&apos; list where people could register for a phone. By the time we started pre-orders in June, we had accumulated 16,000 signatures, which made us feel confident to launch. These people cannot be captured in marketing terms, but what they do share are certain values. Values that seem to have become more important as big brands (in the electronics) industry become more closed and improvements tended to be focused on technology, not ethics. These values are related to sharing, opening, positivity, creativity, access, values that contribute to creating a human feeling of &apos;fair&apos;. Fairphone has given them a means to an end. So how we tapped in to the consumer market can be explained from several angles. The phone is one; our mission is another. \u00a0When it comes to the product, you could say that the phone is distinctive in a market that currently differentiates mainly on design and technology. We feel that the overall reason, however, for our &quot;success&quot; is because we have tapped into a feeling (not a market) surrounding the production of goods in general that is demanding change \u2013 on all levels. \u00a0We see that there is a change happening in the industry, from the consumer to the mineworker, for whom the current economy and business models aren&apos;t working anymore. People are looking for disruptive models and in the end, that&apos;s what Fairphone is: a movement for change. It&apos;s a movement that people can participate in. Their actions, as consumers, amount to a political act, enabling them to voice their discontent and demand change. That is why our product has gained so much attention in a market that seems saturated with big players; the story is different. In addition to this, Fairphone&apos;s business case has recently become very successful in an area that is relatively young \u2013 the social enterprise. We call it a movement, but by offering customers more than a product, whether it&apos;s social impact, or a guarantee of a &quot;net positive effect&quot; of the production of their goods, this idea is gaining momentum. The product is important but it is good to realise and remember that there is an additional responsibility that goes hand-in-hand with production. As for Fairphone&apos;s own funding as a social enterprise. We started up operations of our company, with seed capital we received from a known investor, with whom we had a longstanding relationship with at the Waag incubator (from which we spun off). We had been around for three years prior to this, receiving funding from non-profit foundations supporting our cause. But most importantly, our community of buyers has now financed our next step. This on the one hand has given us a major responsibility, not just toward production of the first phone, but beyond as they have invested in future steps and interventions. On the other, we feel that these buyers have endorsed our mission of creating a fairer economy, and that we can do this together, one step at a time. Our strategy for current operations and production was to make this happen on our own, together with the people who buy the first batch of Fairphones. It&apos;s amazing that this has happened. Once we have proven to be able to produce and market the phone we can be open to social impact investors. Since we won&apos;t raise enough capital from this first round of phones to pre-finance a next batch, we&apos;ll have to rely on impact investors to grow into new markets. From the first batch of the phones any profit we make will be invested in supply chain improvements. With the company up and running, though, we are sure that we will be able to attract social impact investors for the next batch. This will give us the leverage to keep our independence and grow in a natural way. With this community momentum going forward (a growing Facebook community of over 22,000, and over 10,000 pre-orders in just over one month), we can continue our business philosophy of applying commercial strategies to maximize social impact. As we stay transparent in our operations and show our community the steps in making a phone, we feel that our movement has the potential to positively influence our economic system.

Like other Jon McGregor books, it&apos;s very well written, in a very mannered style, but the heart is plain for all to see. Quite beautiful, if bleak. There is a character in it, Sammy, (a minor, minor character), whom I can&apos;t help but think of as an homage to the Sammy of How Late it Was, How Late, the bold Sammy, as he called himself. That connection has made me realise how much McGregor owes to James Kellman.  discobadgers:  On the other hand, Sweet Tooth by Ian McEwan was a real disappointment. Probably the worst of his novels that I&apos;ve read to date. Someone on here a couple of weeks back described it as something like an &quot;info dump&quot; - that&apos;s exactly how I felt. Lots of filler that wasn&apos;t required, characters I didn&apos;t care about and repeating a trick he&apos;s used to much greater effect before. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever read so much by one author who frustrates me as much as McEwan does. With Atonement, everything came together to create near perfection. Others have had their moments, particularly Amsterdam (until it all fell apart in the last twenty pages), but he does make me want to break things at times.  retro77:  Strange Days Indeed: The Golden Age of Paranoia, by Francis Wheen.A blackly comic look back at the 1970s, and a mine of priceless political and social stories from a truly bonkers decade, with a particular focus on the loopier tendencies of its politicians and leaders (taking in Nixon, Wilson and Idi Amin, among others).

Then a light source: the flattering beam of a backlit window or a\u00a0bursting supernova of flash reflected in a bathroom mirror, as preparations are under way for a night out. The pose is important. Knowing self-awareness is conveyed by the slight raise of an eyebrow, the sideways smile that says you&apos;re not taking it too seriously. A doe-eyed stare and mussed-up hair denotes natural beauty, as if you&apos;ve just woken up and can&apos;t help looking like this. Sexiness is suggested by sucked-in cheeks, pouting lips, a nonchalant cock of the head and a hint of bare flesh just below the clavicle. Snap! Afterwards, a flattering filter is applied. Outlines are blurred, colours are softened, a sepia tint soaks through to imply a simpler era of vinyl records and VW camper vans. All of this is the work of an instant. Then, with a single tap, you are ready to upload: to Twitter, to Facebook, to Instagram, each likeness accompanied by a self-referential hashtag. Your image is retweeted and tagged and shared. Your screen fills with thumbs-up signs and heart-shaped emoticons. You are &quot;liked&quot; several times over. You feel a shiver of \u2013 what, exactly? Approbation? Reassurance? Existential calm? Whatever it is, it&apos;s addictive. Soon, you repeat the whole process, trying out a different pose. Again and again, you offer yourself up for public consumption. This, then, is the selfie: the self-portrait of the digital age. We are all at it. Just type &quot;selfie&quot; into the Twitter search bar. Or take a look at Instagram, where over 90m photos are currently posted with the hashtag #me. Adolescent pop poppet Justin Bieber constantly Tweets photos of himself with his shirt off to the shrieking delight of his huge online following. Rihanna has treated her fans to Instagrammed selfies of her enjoying the view at a strip club, of her buttocks barely concealed by a tiny denim thong and of her posing with two oversize cannabis joints while in Amsterdam. Reality TV star Kim Kardashian overshares to the extent that, in March, she posted a picture of her own face covered in blood after undergoing a so-called &quot;vampire facial&quot;. In the same month, the selfie-obsessed model and actress Kelly Brook banned herself from posting any more of them (her willpower lasted two hours).     A 'selfie' by Kelly Brook.     The political classes have started doing it too. President Obama&apos;s daughters, Sasha and Malia, took selfies at his second inauguration. In June, Hillary Clinton got in on the act after her daughter, Chelsea, tweeted a joint picture of them taken on her phone at arm&apos;s length. Earlier this month, three sisters from Nebraska stormed the field of a college baseball match and filmed themselves while doing so, eventually being removed by security guards. Stills from the six-second Vine video clip became known as &quot;the most expensive selfie of all time&quot; after it emerged that the sisters were facing a $1,500 fine. The trend has even reached outer space: in December, Japanese astronaut Aki Hoshide took what might be the greatest selfie of all time at the International Space Station. The\u00a0resulting image encompassed the sun, the Earth, two portions of a robotic arm, a spacesuit and the deep darkness of the infinite beyond. &quot;The selfie is revolutionising how we gather autobiographical information about ourselves and our friends,&quot; says Dr Mariann Hardey, a lecturer in marketing at Durham University who specialises in digital social networks. &quot;It&apos;s about continuously rewriting yourself. It&apos;s an extension of our natural construction of self. It&apos;s about presenting yourself in the best way \u2026 [similar to] when women put on makeup or\u00a0men who bodybuild to look a certain\u00a0way: it&apos;s an aspect of performance that&apos;s about knowing yourself and being vulnerable.&quot; Although photographic self-portraits have been around since 1839, when daguerreotype pioneer Robert Cornelius took a picture of himself outside his family&apos;s store in Philadelphia (whether he had the help of an assistant is not known), it was not until the invention of the compact digital camera that the selfie boomed in popularity. There was some experimentation with the selfie in the 1970s \u2013 most notably by Andy Warhol \u2013 when the Polaroid camera came of age and freed amateur photographers from the tyranny of the darkroom. But film was expensive and it wasn&apos;t until the advent of digital that photographs became truly instantaneous. The fact that we no longer had to traipse to our local chemist to develop a roll of holiday snaps encouraged us to experiment \u2013 after all, on a digital camera, the image could be easily deleted if we didn&apos;t like the results. A selfie could be done with the timer button or simply by holding the camera at arm&apos;s length, if you didn&apos;t mind the looming tunnel of flesh dog-earing one corner of the image. As a result, images tagged as #selfie began appearing on the photo-sharing website Flickr as early as 2004. But it was the introduction of smartphones \u2013 most crucially the iPhone 4, which came along in 2010 with a front-facing camera \u2013 that made the selfie go viral. According to the latest annual Ofcom communications report, 60% of UK mobile phone users now own a smartphone and a recent survey of more than 800 teenagers by the Pew Research Centre in America found that 91% posted photos of themselves online \u2013 up from 79% in 2006. Recently, the Chinese manufacturer Huawei unveiled plans for a new smartphone with &quot;instant facial beauty support&quot; software which reduces wrinkles and blends skin tone. &quot;A lot of the cameras on smartphones are incredibly good,&quot; says Michael Pritchard, the director general of the Royal Photographic Society. &quot;The rise of digital cameras and the iPhone coincided with the fact that there are a lot more single people around [than before]. The number of single-occupancy households is rising, more people are divorcing and living single lives and people go on holiday by themselves more and don&apos;t have anyone else to take the picture. That&apos;s one reason I take selfies: because I do actually want to record where I am.&quot; But if selfies are simply an exercise in recording private memories and charting the course of our lives, then why do we feel such a pressing need to share them with hundreds and thousands of friends and strangers online? To some, the selfie has become the ultimate symbol of the narcissistic age. Its instantaneous nature encourages superficiality \u2013 or so the argument goes. One of the possible side-effects has been that we care more than ever before about how we appear and, as a consequence, social acceptance comes only when the outside world accepts the way we look, rather than endorsing\u00a0the work we do or the way we behave off-camera. The American writer John Paul Titlow has described selfie-sharing as: &quot;a high school popularity contest on digital steroids&quot;. In an article published on the website ReadWrite earlier this year, Titlow argued that selfie users &quot;are seeking some kind of approval from their peers and the larger community, which thanks to the internet is now effectively infinite&quot;. Indeed, although many people who post pictures of themselves on the internet do so in the belief that it will only ever be seen by their group of friends on any given social network, the truth is that the images can be viewed and used by other agencies. There are now entire porn sites devoted to the &quot;amateur&quot; naked selfie and concerns have recently been raised\u00a0that jilted lovers can seek their revenge by making explicit images of their ex publicly available online.     Aki Hoshide's outer space selfie. Photograph: AP    The preponderance of young women posing for selfies in a state of undress is a potentially worrying issue. When the model Cara Delevingne Instagrammed a picture of her nipples poking through a black lace top, it rapidly got over 60,000 &quot;Likes&quot;. According to Gail Dines, the author of Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality: &quot;Because of porn culture, women have internalised that image of themselves. They self-objectify, which means they&apos;re actually\u00a0doing to themselves what the male gaze does to them.&quot; Dines argues that although men can &quot;gain visibility&quot; in a variety of ways, for women the predominant way to get attention is &quot;fuckability&quot;. And it is true that a lot of female selfie aficionados take their visual vernacular directly from pornography (unwittingly or otherwise): the pouting mouth, the pressed-together cleavage, the rumpled bedclothes in the background hinting at opportunity. But Rebecca Brown, a 23-year-old graduate trainee from Birmingham, believes her penchant for selfies is neither degrading nor narcissistic. Instead, she explains, it is a simple means of self-exploration. &quot;It&apos;s almost like a visual diary,&quot; she says. &quot;I can look back and see what I looked like at a particular time, what I was wearing. It&apos;s exploring your identity in digital form. To me it&apos;s not about nudity or having a raunchy or raw kind of look\u2026 People think if you take pictures of yourself, you&apos;re self-obsessed but that&apos;s like saying if you write a diary or an autobiography, you&apos;re self-obsessed. Not necessarily. A selfie is a format and a platform to share who you are.&quot; Does she feed off the social approval that a selfie can generate? &quot;I suppose you take photos to see what you look like,&quot; Brown concedes. &quot;Before I go out, I&apos;ll take a couple of pictures almost to see how I look in other people&apos;s eyes. In the same way that if you wrote a really good piece of work and had people commenting about how good it was, or if you put something on Twitter that people retweeted, if people start liking your selfie, then obviously you&apos;re going to get a natural buzz. It gives you a nice boost and you can walk with that little bit more confidence.&quot; There is nothing new about this, of course. Human beings are social animals and have long been driven by the need for approval and self-affirmation \u2013 albeit on a smaller scale. The desire for a pictorial representation of the self goes all the way back to early handprint paintings on cave walls more than 4,000 years ago. In a fast-paced world of ever-changing technology, it could be argued that the selfie is simply a natural evolution of those hands dipped in paint. &quot;As with so many &apos;new trends&apos;, this one has a fairly distinguished prehistory,&quot; explains essayist and author Geoff Dyer. &quot;In 1925 DH\u00a0Lawrence was bemoaning the way that &apos;each of us has a complete Kodak idea of himself&apos;. This new phenomenon of the selfie has already been turned into a work of art which is also a sort of visual essay: Richard Misrach&apos;s 11.21.11 5.40pm consists of him taking a telephoto shot of a couple on a beach taking a picture of the sea. Then we zoom in closer and closer on each subsequent page until we are able to see the screen of their phone in which is revealed\u2026 a self-portrait.&quot; The popularity of the selfie is, says Mariann Hardey, &quot;an extension of how we live and learn about each other&quot; and a way of imparting necessary information about who we are. By way\u00a0of an example, Hardey says that when her father died suddenly last\u00a0year, she took refuge in her Instagram feed. &quot;I couldn&apos;t bear the conversations but one way to prove to friends that I was OK was to take a picture of myself,&quot; she says. &quot;That revealed something very important to my friends \u2013 one, that\u00a0I was still functioning and, two, I was out doing stuff. An image can convey more than words.&quot; The idea that young women are self-objectifying by posing semi-pornographically for selfies is, she believes, a dangerous one. &quot;When we&apos;re talking about what is acceptable for women in terms of constructing an image, we need to be very careful of not heading down into the territory of &apos;she was wearing a short skirt, so she was asking to be raped&apos;. We should avoid that argument because it&apos;s probably an extension of more patriarchal demands.     A 'selfie' by Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. Photograph: Chelsea Clinton/AP    &quot;Women should be allowed to portray themselves in a way they feel enhanced by. Who didn&apos;t experiment with cutting their hair off and dying it pink when they were younger? This is just a natural progression of experimenting with the changing interfaces of being young and one of these interfaces, yes, is sexual identity.&quot; A selfie can, in some respects, be a more authentic representation of beauty than other media images. In an article for Psychology Today published earlier this year, Sarah J Gervais, an assistant professor of psychology, wrote that: &quot;Instagram (and other social media) has allowed the public to\u00a0reclaim\u00a0photography as a source of empowerment\u2026 [it] offers a quiet resistance to the barrage of perfect images that we face each day. Rather than being bombarded with those creations\u2026 we can look through our Instagram feed and see images of real people \u2013 with beautiful diversity. &quot;Instagram also allows us the opportunity to see below the surface. We capture a glimpse into the makings\u00a0of people&apos;s daily lives. We get\u00a0a sense of those things that make the everyday extraordinary.&quot; The appeal for celebrities like Bieber, Kardashian et al is connected to this. The expansion of social networking has enabled them to communicate directly with their fanbase and to build up large, loyal followings among people who believe they are getting a real glimpse into the lives of the rich and famous. &quot;If you&apos;re going for a younger audience, you&apos;re expected to engage with every media channel available to you,&quot; says leading PR Mark Borkowski. &quot;Every aspect of Rihanna&apos;s life is about her letting people in. Some people are very natural and normal about it and completely comfortable with being &apos;on&apos; and that&apos;s fine. But it becomes unstuck if it&apos;s not real. A selfie has to be &apos;the real you&apos;. It works if you can give people a manageable piece of reality which is who you are.&quot; The key is the idea of &quot;manageable reality&quot;: celebrities can now exercise more control than ever over the dissemination of their image. The paradox at the heart of the selfie is that it masquerades as a &quot;candid&quot; shot, taken without access to airbrushing or post-production, but in fact, a carefully posed selfie, edited with all the right filters, is a far more appealing prospect than a snatched paparazzo shot taken from a deliberately unflattering angle. &quot;It&apos;s about self-exposure and control,&quot; says artist Simon Foxall, whose work questions the parameters of individuality and self-expression. &quot;A selfie blurs the line between &apos;reality&apos; and the performance of a fantasy self, so one collapses into the other.&quot; Beyond that, a judicious use of selfies can make good business sense too: Alexa Chung and Florence Welch have both used selfies to post daily updates on what they are wearing, thereby cementing their position as modern style icons and guaranteeing, no doubt, the continuation of a series of lucrative fashion deals. (Chung, for\u00a0one, has designed a womenswear line for the fashion brand Madewell for\u00a0the last three years.) The website What I Wore Today began as a site that featured young entrepreneur Poppy Dinsey posing for a daily selfie, in a different outfit for every day of the year. It became an internet hit and has now expanded to allow users to upload their own images, as well as generating advertising revenue by featuring online links to clothing retailers.     Poppy Dinsey began her fashion blog by using selfies.     &quot;People like the control selfies give them,&quot; says Dinsey (pictured below). &quot;Sometimes it&apos;s just a practical matter of not having anyone around to shoot you and that&apos;s why I always took my own pictures in mirrors for WIWT. But you&apos;re deciding how to frame yourself \u2013 you&apos;re not trusting someone else to make you look good. With front-facing cameras on iPhones, and so on, you can see the picture you&apos;re taking and frame it perfectly to show yourself off as best as possible \u2013 your mate isn&apos;t going to make the same effort when taking your picture. Plus, you can retake and retake without anyone having to know how much vanity has gone into that &apos;casual&apos; pose.&quot; In some ways, of course, the notion of control is disingenuous: once a selfie is posted online, it is out there for public delectation. Future employers can see it. Marketers can use it. A resentful former lover could exploit it. You can use digital technology to manipulate your own image as much as you like. But the truth about selfies is that once they are online, you can never control how other people see you.", "sentences": ["Rihanna has treated her fans to Instagrammed selfies of her enjoying the view at a strip club, of her buttocks barely concealed by a tiny denim thong and of her posing with two oversize cannabis joints while in Amsterdam."], "title": "How selfies became a global phenomenon", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/14/how-selfies-became-a-global-phenomenon", "tags": ["Smartphones", "iPhone", "Mobile phones", "Samsung", "Instagram", "Technology", "Women", "Life and style", "Pornography", "Culture", "Privacy", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-07-15T06:00:00Z", "article": "WINNING TIP: La Pagoda, Marzamemi, Sicily On the waterfront, overlooking the harbour in this Sicilian fishing village is the bar La Pagoda.

He&apos;s all over the web, just for today, with articles explaining who he was. And why? It is his 407th birthday and Google has honoured him with one of its doodles. Come, now. Rembrandt does not need a doodle to make him interesting. It&apos;s the equivalent of Google celebrating the fact that planet Earth is 4.54bn years old or honouring the human species. Rembrandt, like these phenomena, is too big to need a Google doodle. This artist who lived and worked in 17th-century Amsterdam, who in his lifetime was rich and poor and happy and ruined, who painted portraits of such depth and perceptiveness that when you stand in front of one you feel challenged by the living essence of a person looking straight back at you, does not need to be namechecked to make him profound, arresting or timeless. The entire online world is less substantial than a single piece of paint on one of Rembrandt&apos;s encrusted canvases. If there is one artist who cannot be experienced on a screen, it is Rembrandt. You have to encounter his paintings for real. Rembrandt sat down in his studio one day in the 1650s to make a painting of his lover Hendrickje Stoffels. She posed in a fur wrap over her bare breasts in a dusky bedroom moment. Her dark eyes look honestly out of the painting he created. At that moment, she was being censured by the reformed church in Amsterdam for living with Rembrandt out of wedlock. The community branded her a whore. Rembrandt portrays her as a woman of character and beauty whom he loves. She is alive in the painting, just as he is alive in his self-portraits. Hendrickje and Rembrandt look back at us down the corridor of time in works that go beyond art, into the realm of absolute truth. Then again, you can look at Rembrandt purely as a technical wizard. In his painting Belshazzar&apos;s Feast, the opulent layering of gold and white in the glistening robes of a Babylon tyrant is one of the most seductive, yet slightly disgusting, passages of painting on Earth. Rembrandt expresses the moral squalor of luxury through a stupefying excess of painterly richness. The point is, all these paintings \u2013 Hendrickje Stoffels, Belshazzar&apos;s Feast, the many self-portraits \u2013 need to be looked at in the flesh, as physical realities, to exert their power. A quick snack of information online \u2013 Google doodle, Rembrandt&apos;s birthday, let&apos;s move on \u2013 has absolutely no purchase on the authority of his art. It has to be experienced in real time, in a real place. The real place where these paintings can be found is the National Gallery in London, where they can be looked at on any day of the week, free of charge. Rembrandt is looking back at you and me \u2013 and at Google, too.

To find out, I sought out the most courier-friendly bike I could find (an Eastway TR.1, a single-speed with arigid but light frame) and met up with 34-year-old Polish-born cycle courier Judy Ubych. She arrived in London from Amsterdam five years ago with a degree in anthropology and is now one of a two-member team at courier company Byca Boy, working 10 until 7, Monday to Friday, covering more than 90 miles in a busy day. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I planned to do it for years, but it\u2019s a better job than waitressing and it\u2019s hard to find a professional role as a foreigner in London,\u201d she explains. Climbing on her fixed-gear bike \u2013 which she inherited through the biker network after a fellow courier broke his collarbone and never returned to riding \u2013 she offers her thoughts on why there are still \u201cdefinitely more guys\u201d in the job: \u201cI think women tend to know what they want to do with their lives and this is probably the lowest paid job in London and doesn\u2019t really have much of a future.\u201d Are female couriers treated differently? \u201cI used to get annoyed when guys in postrooms were calling me \u2018sweetie,\u2019\u201d she agrees, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not someone\u2019s \u2018darling\u2019 \u2013 I deliver urgent packages for a living and I demand respect.\u201d We head off, leaving the trendy cyclist hangout and cafe Look Mum No Hands! to pick up our first package in St Paul\u2019s. \u201cI like the freedom,\u201d she yells over her shoulder 10 minutes later. \u201cNot being stuck in an office, that\u2019s the best part.\u201d So what\u2019s the worse part? \u201cWind,\u201d she replies, but that\u2019s not something we have to worry about today, coasting over Southwark Bridge to complete our first job, the sun warming our backs. Right now, freewheeling downhill towards Borough High Street with some of London\u2019s best buildings in view, I can understand why people do it. \u201cWhen I first started, it was a subculture,\u201d says Byca Boy founder, 33-year-old Sebastian Cherchi-Bersch: \u201cYou\u2019d compete in courier races, drink the whole night through \u2013 but these days it doesn\u2019t happen so much.\u201d One thing that does still happen, though, is the risk-taking. Ubych squeezes through a terrifyingly tight space between a bus and the curb. By 11am, we\u2019re on our way to Brick Lane, heading up Bishopsgate before turning right through Spitalfields, when I get a flat tyre. All those rumours about cycle couriers being bike-magicians are true. Ubych fixes it in under five minutes. Next we arrive at a Brick Lane warehouse where we\u2019re handed another tiny, nondescript package bound for Holborn. Along the way we stop at a red light, next to another bike upon which sits a woman in a Brooklyn courier cap and decked head to toe in international cycling gear. \u201cThat\u2019s Emily Chappell,\u201d says Ubych conspiratorially. Chappell is an award-winning courier who travels around the world on a bike and blogs about it. She\u2019s the British queen of cycle couriering, and an inspiration to women who want to earn a crust from bike-riding. The minute the lights go green, Chappell is gone for dust and soon enough we\u2019re weaving through traffic near Green Park. Our next pick-up is a photographer\u2019s lens which is to be delivered back to Holborn. \u201cThe three most common things we deliver are theatre tickets, clothing and legal documents,\u201d says Cherchi-Bersch . \u201cBut, I\u2019ve had some odd ones, like delivering a woman\u2019s personal stuff back to her in a plastic bag, from her boyfriend who\u2019d just broken up with her. I picked up an engagement ring once too.\u201d Despite the wind, the risk of punctures and the odd sexist comment, Ubych clearly enjoys the job: \u201cI still can\u2019t believe that someone pays me to ride my bike,\u201d she says.

The challenge for any museum or gallery is to match the \u00a316.5m paid by the Getty museum in California for the postcard-sized self-portrait. Its value has rocketed since it first turned up in a provincial auction house six years ago after at least a century in a private British collection, tentatively identified as a possible Rembrandt copy and estimated at \u00a31,500. Word evidently got out in the trade that the picture was something special, as a bidding war broke out during a sale in 2007 at the Moore Allen &amp; Innocent auction house in Gloucestershire. It went to a UK buyer \u2013 believed to be a London dealer \u2013 for \u00a32.2m. Even that looked like the bargain of the century as soon afterwards it was identified by Ernst van de Vetering, head of the Amsterdam-based Rembrandt Research Project and an acknowledged expert on the work of the 17th-century Dutch master, as a genuine early self-portrait. The work shows Rembrandt in his early 20s, hair tousled, head thrown back, roaring with laughter. It was probably painted in about 1628,one of a handful he created on copper. The painting&apos;s history remained unknown for more than a century after Rembrandt&apos;s death in 1669. It was wrongly identified as early as 1800 when an engraving was made that described it as the work of his contemporary Frans Hals. The Getty announced this spring that it had bought the picture, one of its first major acquisitions since appointing a new director, Tim Potts, who left the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge last year. Potts said he had been in pursuit of the painting since he arrived at the Getty, describing Rembrandt&apos;s series of self-portraits as &quot;his most sustained and remarkable achievement&quot;. The export bar means that a British collection has until October to match the Getty&apos;s price, though the bar could be extended by another six months if a realistic chance of achieving it emerges. Ed Vaizey, the culture minister, said UK galleries had an impressive collection of works by Rembrandt but nothing from such an early period. &quot;I hope that my deferral of the export licence will allow time for a buyer to come forward and secure this exquisite painting for the nation, where it can be studied and enjoyed by all.&quot;", "sentences": ["Even that looked like the bargain of the century as soon afterwards it was identified by Ernst van de Vetering, head of the Amsterdam-based Rembrandt Research Project and an acknowledged expert on the work of the 17th-century Dutch master, as a genuine early self-portrait."], "title": "UK delays export of Rembrandt self-portrait", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/16/export-delay-rembrandt-self-portrait", "tags": ["Rembrandt", "Art and design", "Culture", "Museums", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-07-16T23:06:00Z", "article": "THE WORLD&apos;S EMPTIEST STADIUMS &quot;Everyone seems to be obsessed with record crowds nowadays,&quot; sighed Andy McKenzie, wistfully looking at photos of empty, windswept terraces back in 2008. &quot;But the other day as I was talking to a friend about Scottish lower division football, we wondered what it would be like to watch Queen&apos;s Park at Hampden. This season they have had crowds of fewer than 500 in a 52,000 capacity stadium, meaning over 51,500 empty seats. What is the record number of empty seats there have been at a major league or cup match?&quot; The Knowledge inbox has been bulging (if an inbox can bulge) with bids for this particular crown. Here&apos;s our top 10: 10. Yokohama Marinos - 51,207 &quot;The capacity of the Nissan Stadium (aka Yokohama International Stadium) is 72,372,&quot; writes Richard Finch, &quot;and has been used by Yokohama Marinos since 1998 when the average attendance was 19,165. A quick subtraction results in an average of 51,207 unused seats.&quot; Not a bad effort, but we can do better than that ... 9. FC Amsterdam - 64,500 Over to Nick den Uijl. &quot;In the 70s, FC Amsterdam played in the Eredivisie. Their home stadium was the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam. They would play in front of only a handful of people. In September 1977, for instance, they lost 1-3 to FC Twente in front of 1,500 spectators. Earlier that year the Cup Winners&apos; Cup final was played between Hamburg and Anderlecht in the same stadium in front of 66,000 people.&quot; 8. Juventus - 68,763 &quot;Assuming we are discounting several games played behind closed doors,&quot; says Simon Halstead (and yes, we are), &quot;I would have to say Juventus&apos; Coppa Italia home match against Sampdoria in the 2001-02 season. Only 237 spectators showed up. With the Stadio Delle Alpi&apos;s capacity of 69,000 this leaves 68,763 empty seats.&quot; Thanks also to David Pasley, who suggested this fixture. 7. Hertha Berlin - c.73,000 &quot;Although I cannot provide any details,&quot; says Alex J\u00e4kel, who won&apos;t let that stop him, &quot;I would reckon that Hertha Berlin in the 1980s would be a prime example.&quot; Yes, Hertha&apos;s struggles in the 80s led to a few spare seats at the Olympic Stadium. When Hertha were relegated from 2.Bundesliga in 1986, attendances fell to as low as 1,800, leaving around 73,000 empty seats. 6. Borussia Dortmund reserves - 79,028 Let Martin Tobutt tell the story. &quot;This may be cheating a little but a match from last Saturday&apos;s German Third Division North featured Borussia Dortmund&apos;s reserves at home to Wuppertal. Normally, such teams play at the club&apos;s old ground or training ground - in Borussia&apos;s case Rote Erde, which has 3,000 seats and then a 22,000-capacity standing area which is open to the elements.&quot; Yes, yes, get on with it. &quot;Looking at the TV pictures, it appears that the gale force winds that day meant that the match was moved to the Westfalenstadion meaning that the 1680 paying customers were housed in a ground holding 80,708 fans. In terms of empty seats, I make that 79,028.&quot; 5. Torpedo Moscow - 80,000+ &quot;It pains me to no end - but my local club, Torpedo Moscow, I would think would have to claim this dubious honour,&quot; writes a bullish Leonid Mironov. &quot;They play at the Luzhniki Stadium which has a capacity of 84,000 and a bit. For the past couple of season the average attendance has been around 3,000-4,000. That leaves almost 80,000 empty seats on average. I am pretty sure that we win this little competition (although obviously I would love to be wrong on this one).&quot; Leonid, you are wrong. Not even close, in fact. Read on. 4. Istanbul B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fehir Belediyespor (Istanbul BBS) - c.81,000 Chris Wade has a higher offer from Ankara. &quot;They don&apos;t announce official figures for matches in the Turkish Super Lig for some reason,&quot; he writes, &quot;but on December 9 last year I listened to the radio broadcast of Istanbul BBS v Genclerbirligi which was being played at Istanbul&apos;s Ataturk Olympic Stadium. The radio announcer said he could see a total of six fans in the 81,283 stadium. There were a few more than that, as this picture shows but the entire crowd could not have numbered more than 50 souls for the exciting 0-0 draw.&quot; We reckon there&apos;s at least a couple of hundred in that picture, but it&apos;s one empty stadium nevertheless. 3. Leeds United v VfB Stuttgart - 90,000+ Joe Skinner, Doug Kirkpatrick and Andrew Limb have emailed in to nominate Leeds United&apos;s Champions League tie against VfB Stuttgart at the Camp Nou in 1992. With Stuttgart having fielded an ineligible player during the second leg of their 4-4 aggregate draw (Stuttgart would have gone through on aggregate), Uefa ordered the two teams to play a one-off decider at a neutral venue, and Barcelona&apos;s ground was chosen. No one can agree on the stadium&apos;s exact capacity in those days before it became an all-seater, but it was close to 100,000 meaning at least 90,000 spaces were left vacant as Carl Shutt tucked home the winner in front of 7,400 fans. 2. Necaxa - 118,000+ We&apos;re into six figures now. &quot;I lived in Mexico City from 1995 to 2002 and went to see all the local teams while there,&quot; says Iain Pearson. &quot;The most surreal was visiting Necaxa who were playing their home games in the Azteca Stadium (capacity: 120,000). If they were playing a team from out of town in midweek they would be lucky to host a &apos;crowd&apos; of 2,000 - leaving 118,000 empty seats.&quot; A worthy effort, but the crown goes to ... 1. Thames Association FC - 119,531 Neal Martin presents: West Ham Stadium. Thames Association FC still hold the record for the lowest attendance in Football League history when 469 went through the turnstiles, to watch Thames take on Luton in December 1930. It&apos;s claimed that the ground could hold 120,000 spectators (although estimates do vary), which leaves 119,531 tickets unsold. HAS FOOTBALL EVER BEEN ILLEGAL IN BRITAIN? &quot;I vaguely recall hearing on the radio a while back that football was once illegal in Britain. Is this true?&quot; asked a rather bemused Craig Dunmore in 2007. While some would say that crimes such as England&apos;s performance in Euro &apos;92 and the very existence of Wags Boutique should be grounds for slapping a banning order on all football in Britain, it has been quite some time since the game was illegal in this country. In fact, the game was only illegal before the Football Association laid down the current laws in the 19th century, and then it was only outlawed for limited periods in specific parts of the country. It was first banned way back in April 1314 by Edward II when the game consisted of vast mobs attempting to kick, carry or throw the ball between opposing villages. &quot;For as much as there is great noise in the city, caused by hustling over large balls from which many evils might arise which God forbid, we command and forbid, on behalf of the king, a pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future,&quot; he proclaimed. During the Hundred Years&apos; War between England and France, Edward III, Richard II, Henry IV and Henry V all thought the game stopped their subjects practising archery and issued laws to suppress it. Scottish kings didn&apos;t look upon the game much more favourably and in 1424 James I decreed that &quot;na man play at the Fute-ball&quot;. Attitudes became more relaxed during the Elizabethan period, although the game was banned in Manchester in the early 17th century because of shanked passes breaking windows. Despite playing in his youth, the game&apos;s &quot;frivolity&quot; didn&apos;t fit into Oliver Cromwell&apos;s puritanical world view and the fact that the game was played on Sundays was particularly frowned upon. This led to football on the Sabbath pretty much disappearing for the next 300 years. However, the authorities never succeeded in stamping the game out - despite cities such as Derby introducing anti-riot laws to combat it - and its popularity increased as time went on, eventually leading to the formation of the FA. UNORTHODOX MOTIVATIONAL TECHNIQUES &quot;Ex-Croatian national coach Miroslav Blazevic, before a match in the dressing room, once took his new Rolex, dropped it and smashed it jumping on it, saying: &apos;I want you to smash them like I smashed this watch.&apos; &quot;Are there any stranger examples of how other coaches have attempted to motivate their players?&quot; asked Dubravko Milicic in 2009. &quot;When Klaus Toppm\u00f6ller was attempting to win the title with Eintracht Frankfurt, he showed the players a replica of the Meisterschale, the big, ugly plate the German champion gets for coming in first,&quot; recounts Eberhard Spohd. &quot;This didn&apos;t work so he tried with a huge living eagle (the animal in the coat of arms of Eintracht) which he brought into the changing room with the words: &apos;You must clutch your opposites like the eagle puts his fangs in his prey.&quot; Other witnesses report that he said, &quot;Unity (Eintracht in German) gives you wings.&quot; The players seemed rather scared and finished fifth and Toppm\u00f6ller was sacked the following April. Sounds like Toppm\u00f6ller would get on well with former Spurs boss Christian Gross, who, when in charge of Grasshoppers Zurich, brought his players to a medieval castle so that they could &quot;envisage a fortress and turn our stadium into one&quot;. Oops, didn&apos;t mean to interrupt Eberhard. &quot;Another one who tried to motivate his players in a special way was Christoph Daum,&quot; he continues. &quot;When he was manager of Bayer Leverkusen, he made them walk over pieces of broken glass. In an interview with the German magazine Maxim, he explained why he did this: &apos;What did the players say? They said: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t do it&quot; and I said to them: &quot;OK, record this, and then I will show you which unbelievable forces, which power of autosuggestion slumbers in the thinking device between your ears.&apos; That&apos;s what the pieces of glass were for, to show the players: &apos;your head is your third leg. Use it&apos;.&quot; &quot;Jurgen Klinsmann also tried a special way to motivate his players at FC Bayern Munich in the beginning of the season,&quot; adds Eberhard, who&apos;s clearly on a roll. &quot;He let Bayern install four statues of Buddha on the roof of the training camp of the club and some in a room inside. &apos;They give us a certain flow of energy&apos;, Klinsmann said. One of the players, Daniel van Buyten, said: &apos;I have a statue in my reading room at home. They give me a sense of calm and strength.&apos; After two months, the statues had to be removed because in very catholic Bavaria the club got a lot of letters complaining that the statues force religious feelings on some people.&quot; Meanwhile in Blighty, Ian Holloway once employed a former soldier to shout phrases like &quot;High five!&quot; and &quot;Go to work!&quot; at his team while they got changed. And at Brentford, Martin Allen once nailed a bicycle to the dressing room wall to make the point that he wanted his players to, um, get on their bikes. BULL V GOAT &quot;While procastrinating on Wikipedia, I checked out Man City&apos;s season-by-season stats and saw that Shaun Goater was City&apos;s top scorer for four consecutive seasons and to make it exciting, in three different divisions,&quot; wrote Mahdi Rahimi in 2009. &quot;Is there any player who can better those stats \u2014 being club&apos;s top scorer in three different divisions in three consecutive years?&quot; There is indeed Mahdi, and his name is Steve Bull. The striker was Wolves&apos; top scorer in Division Four in 1988-89, Division Three in 1989-90 and Division Two in 1990-91. More than that, in each season he was the the divisional top scorer and selected in the respective league&apos;s team of the season. He went on to be the club&apos;s top scorer for the next six seasons after that. We&apos;d say that tops the Goat&apos;s admittedly remarkable achievement. Mark Ashley Thomas writes to point us in the direction of man who can match Goater&apos;s stats \u2013 Coventry forward Freddy Eastwood. Eastwood&apos;s scoring record with the Sky Blues might not be up to much, but he once banged them in with abandon for Southend. He was the top scorer for the Shrimpers in the 2004-05 in League Two, in 2005-06 in League One, and also in 2006-07 in the Championship. And Peter Collins has another suggestion: &quot;It&apos;s a slightly different tack, but I think I&apos;m right in saying that Kerry Dixon was top scorer in the whole of division three in 1982-83 while with Reading, then Division Two&apos;s top scorer the following season with Chelsea, then shared the Division One golden boot with Gary Lineker in 1984-85 after the Blues were promoted.&quot; A quick scour through our dusty Rothmans indicate that you are indeed right, Peter. And it was in that trawl that another couple of names sprung to mind. But neither Luther Blissett (Watford&apos;s top scorer in the Third, Second and First Divisions in 1978-79, 1981-82 and 1982-83) nor Alan Cork (who topped the scoring charts for Wimbledon in the Third Division in 1983-84 and the Second in 1985-86, but not in the top or bottom flights) quite came up to scratch. \u2022 Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com.

As the celebrated architect hits 80 and a retrospective of his 50-year career called Inside Out swings open its doors at the Royal Academy in London, here&apos;s your chance to chat with him.           Have you seen his Cheesegrater towering over London and wondered why he decided to sprinkle the whole city? Or pondered what he&apos;d change about the Pompidou Centre in Paris or the Lloyd&apos;s building in London \u2013 or the Millennium Dome for that matter \u2013 if he could start over? How about what he&apos;d do if he could design a city from scratch? Why he feels so strongly that buildings should behave like clocks? Or how his personal life has shaped his singular vision? Ask away \u2026 \u2022 Richard Rogers will be here to answer your questions between 1pm and 2pm (GMT) on Friday 19 July. Post your questions below, then come back here to join him in conversation on Friday We have posted the Q&amp;A here to make it easier to read: Angelofthenorth asked: What do you think is important in the planning of new towns or urban extensions? Can they ever be as humane as a city that has grown organically over several centuries and if so, how do you achieve it? Do you think that self-build neighbourhoods as found in Almere and the IJburg in Amsterdam etc, by diversifying ownership, is the way forward? Richard Rogers replied: There are beautiful planned towns such as Dubrovnik, Croatia, which the Venetians built wonderfully. Cubitt&apos;s London is a planned neighbourhood, or Nash&apos;s Golden Mile and so on. On the other hand, there are many isolated, single activity developments such as dormitory towns which are unsatisfactory. Age can help give character. irishrichy asked: Is there anything you&apos;d change about the way architects are trained in the UK? Richard Rogers replied: I don&apos;t like the way that architectural training is often limited to the design of buildings. I&apos;m for an education which overlaps architecture, urban design, engineering, landscape and sustainable design. Scousetone asked: Aside from New York, do you think skyscrapers are an apt reflection of the culture and society of a place? Richard Rogers replied: Tall buildings can and do define cultures just as lower and medium height buildings do. |t depends how they are designed and more importantly, how the spaces between the buildings are designed and what activities they include. I&apos;m all for mixed-use rather than ghettos. Bodwyn asked: Richard, I took my kids to see the Pompidou Centre for the first time last summer and they were as excited about it as I remember being when I first saw it in the late 70&apos;s; what buildings still have the power to excite you when you re-visit them? Richard Rogers replied: I am delighted that the Pompidou Centre did excite you and your children, maybe partly because it is not a building, more a place full of different activities. The small square in the hillside town of Pienza in Tuscany or St Ivo in Rome are wonderful places. artist47365 asked: Hi Richard. What is the most memorable art exhibition you&apos;ve seen lately? Richard Rogers replied: I saw the great Marcel Duchamp exhibition in the Barbican. Angelofthenorth asked: What is the best piece of advice you&apos;ve ever been given? Richard Rogers replied: Enjoy the quality of life. It is better to work to live than to live to work. TOMBOLO asked: Given sufficient political power, would you reform the planning process? If so, how? And with what aims? Richard Rogers replied: I chaired the Labour government&apos;s Urban Task Force &apos;Towards an Urban Renaissance&apos; which made 105 recommendations. One could start there. Possibly the most important recommendation is to build on derelict land first, before building on green, and where possible retrofit buildings rather than building new. It&apos;s more sustainable. gingerwinger asked: Your \u00a360k house project is all very laudable but it is so far very small beer. What do you think would be the single most positive move to promote a low-cost housing re-surgence in Britain today and why are governments and house builders alike doing so little to move this forward? Please get as political as you like. Richard Rogers replied: The critical problems is poitical and economic. The house builders seem to make most of their money dealing in land and especially this government is unwilling to invest in affordable housing. The 60K house is a model which meets the needs of building sustainably, well, quickly and efficiently for a low cost. Emina_Bosnia asked: What advice would you give to the young generation of architects? What is for you the most important thing architects need to remember when planning a new design? Richard Rogers replied: Architecture is socially driven. swiftasgold asked: How do you think the current crop of very tall buildings in London will stand the test of time? Will they still be standing in centuries to come and if so how might they be viewed by future generations? Richard Rogers replied: The shock of the new is always difficult to deal with, and tall buildings have always been shocking. There are records of complaints in the 14th century of Palazzi overshadowing the neighboring single storey buildings - for example Palazzo Strozzi in Florence. mjback asked: What do you think of the Shard? Richard Rogers replied: I think it is the most beautiful tall building in London. It is well placed, standing over a major transportation hub. turini2 asked: If Heathrow went away, what would you do with the huge area of land left empty? Richard Rogers replied: It could make a large, new, well-planned urban borough with plenty of public space, and well connected by the existing public transport system. simonk asked: Are you still optimistic about the future of British cities? Do you feel that momentum towards an &apos;urban renaissance&apos; has been lost with a change of government and public austerity? Richard Rogers replied: These are difficult times. There is a danger that the climate of greed will derail the urban renaissance and undermine quality of life, but in the long term I remain optimistic because cities are now recognised as critical to quality of life and environmental sustainability. latestvictim asked: How would you improve the High Street? With so many empty shops and buying online could you suggest a way of adding housing to a high street that could improve a community and blend with retail space in a way that accommodates all ages and would you think this was good idea. Richard Rogers replied: The high street is the hub of a neighbourhood. We should not undermine it by, for instance, building out of town shopping centers or suburbs. If we accept that it is critical to increase density and build only on derelict land close to or in the high street, then the high street will thrive. TheInertiaKid asked: How do you feel about Ern\u0151 Goldfinger&apos;s Alexander Fleming House (now known as Metro Central Heights) receiving Grade II listed status last week?It has attracted much criticism throughout its life, and seems only to have become a truly functioning building following its late-90s conversion to a residential block. Despite my fondness for Goldfinger&apos;s work, I wonder whether English Heritage and the Department for Culture are guilty of a little revisionism regarding this building. Richard Rogers replied: Revisionism is alright, better late than never! pete kurachka asked: Can good architecture be done on minimum (i.e. developer&apos;s) budget? Can you give any examples? Richard Rogers replied: There is a very nice story about Inigo Jones being approached by the burghers of Soho, asking him if he could recommend an architect as they could not afford him. In fact he built what has been called &apos;the most beautiful barn in England.&apos; Nesh142 asked: The RIBA has produced a survey called a &quot;Study of the earnings of architecture students 2011-2012&quot; which indicates that female architecture graduates (post Part I and II) still get paid less than their male counterparts.This gap in pay seems to be irrespective of years of experience or hours worked and performance etc., as even the starting salaries offered to new male graduates are higher than that of new female graduates. This gap in is also seen to increase for post Part II graduates.Why do you think this is happening? And what advice would you have for female graduates and architects who have to suffer this injustice in our profession? Richard Rogers replied: Unfortunately, though things have improved, we still don&apos;t treat women equally. I am all for the regulations that more civilized Nordic countries have to encourage more women to join the profession and have more female board members. On a slightly different subject, I think that all staff, be they students, graduates or experienced architects should all be paid. LaureninLondon asked: Hi Richard,Given the recent cyclist deaths in London (3 in 3 weeks), how do you think we can create the political will for change? i.e. How do we make politicians reallocate space away from motor vehicles and towards cyclists and pedestrians? Richard Rogers replied: Cycling must be encouraged. One third of the people in Copenhagen cycle, but in London it is under 5 percent. The car culture is being eroded, but we have a long way to go. We need to ban cars from central London, make streets narrower and build more well-designed bike lanes. Cycling is energy efficient and good for your health. I predict that we shall be traveling in electric rickshaws, bicycles and even rollerskates within the next 25 years. Richard Rogers said: Thanks to the Guardian for hosting this today, and thank you for the excellent questions. I thoroughly enjoyed it.", "sentences": ["Do you think that self-build neighbourhoods as found in Almere and the IJburg in Amsterdam etc, by diversifying ownership, is the way forward?"], "title": "Richard Rogers live webchat: post your questions now", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/17/richard-rogers-webchat-post-questions", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art", "Richard Rogers"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-07-17T21:23:12Z", "article": "This week has been an apt reminder that George Orwell&apos;s dismissive name for the England of 1984 was Airstrip One. Except where the venerable gloom-monger was referring to America&apos;s pernicious influence, the past few days have given another meaning to the term, by underlining the strength of the aviation lobby. The week began with the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, setting out his plans for a giant new airport on Kent&apos;s Isle of Grain. Yesterday saw the comeback from the consortium running Heathrow airport: three options for a third runway, to be built by the end of the next decade. Two very different blueprints for the future of Britain&apos;s transport network and its economy, but with one tarmac-coated common assumption: that the future inevitably lies in building more airport capacity at the cost of many billions and allowing tens of thousands more flights \u2013 at ruinous cost to the environment. Just what does ruinous mean? Start with the local costs. The easiest, quickest option from Heathrow, building north, would mean demolishing the villages of Sipson, Harlington and Cranford Cross and displacing 2,700 households. The least invasive plan would still destroy part of a reservoir, a village and would involve building over the M25. Full credit to Sir Howard Davies and his fellow airports commissioners for calling all submissions in so early \u2013 because they have effectively forced the aviation lobby to show their hands and give all-too-concrete detail about the costs of their schemes. After the Heathrow expansion plans were canned in 2010, an entire industry began a well-resourced campaign in talking up the need for a hub and how London risked losing out to Paris and Amsterdam. Such rhetoric sounded persuasive in the abstract, but many Londoners (and non-Londoners) will find the specifics hard to stomach. Before putting this debate into a wider context, it is worth remembering a few specifics. First, Heathrow remains the busiest airport in Europe. Second, projections of demand are often wrong. As the National Audit Office observed last year, Britain&apos;s first high-speed rail line was built on &quot;hugely optimistic&quot; forecasts for demand that never materialised. Finally and perhaps most importantly, controlling the growth of aviation will be crucial to ensuring Britain meets its carbon emissions targets and therefore plays its part in averting climate catastrophe. It is hard to imagine how the UK will cut greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050 if it is building a third, a fourth (as suggested by Heathrow yesterday) and perhaps even preparing a fifth runway in a corner of west London. Expanding airports in the south-east risks locking Britain into a climate-destroying and regionally unbalanced future. No amount of lobbying should distract us from that.", "sentences": ["After the Heathrow expansion plans were canned in 2010, an entire industry began a well-resourced campaign in talking up the need for a hub and how London risked losing out to Paris and Amsterdam."], "title": "Britain and Heathrow: gearing up for Airstrip One | Editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/17/heathrow-airport-runway-editorial", "tags": ["Heathrow third runway", "Air transport", "Airline industry", "Boris Johnson", "Travel and transport", "London", "Heathrow", "Environment", "Business", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-07-18T09:25:00Z", "article": "For a day I felt a little like Evan Davis, hosting the Guardian&apos;s answer to Dragons&apos; Den, the Activate Tech Talent day where eight budding entrepreneurs battled it out to win the attention and praise of a panel of judges comprised of leading investors and journalists. The prize was not a cash investment, that the companies &quot;so desperately needed&quot; as Evan Davies would say, but instead the opportunity to present to a much wider audience at the Guardian Activate Summit. To get there they needed to convince the judges not only that their idea was a good business or charity but that it also had the power to positively change the world around us. The talent day was held at the newly opened #guardiancoffee in Shoreditch, the heart of Tech City UK. The pop-up cafe sweltered on one of the hottest days of the year making everyone feel like they were in a literal dragon&apos;s den. The runners-up Alice Bonasio, a PR manager at a previous winner of the talent day, Mendeley, presented a new take on crowdsourcing, Crowdcelerate. Her business idea, still just on paper, is to connect entrepreneurs to service providers who would be willing to say provide web development or design skills for free in exchange for equity in a proposed new business. Crowdcelerate would take a 1% stake in the business for having connecting the entrepreneurs and the service providers together. The judges felt that while the idea was admirable, many entrepreneurs would be unwilling to publish their new business concept so publically before they had even started work on building a new product or service. Tom Berman, a technologist and adventurer presented PicFit a simple to use iPhone and Android app to help improve the dieting process. Users would take a photograph of every meal they ate throughout the day and PicFit will attempt to analyse the calorie content. A graph would match user&apos;s calorie intake to their own pre-set targets. Tom argued that this provides a more personalised dieting solution than market leaders Weight Watchers and its points based system. The judges wondered what would happen if only half a meal was eaten and whether users would be willing to take a photograph of literally every single item of food and drink they ate a day but thought there was potential to license the app to food retailers or producers to use as a marketing tool. Paul Joyce, the co-founder of GeckoBoard presented his company&apos;s hugely successful data visualisation and communications tool for businesses and governments. He argued that understanding every part of the data relating to an organisation allows them to make significant efficiency changes. Judging his entry was difficult for the panel of judges who decided that as a well established and well funded startup, it was unfair to judge his business in comparison to genuinely new startups. Morgan Sowden, the entrepreneur in residence at Bebo founder Michael Birch&apos;s Monkey Inferno presented a compelling pitch of a new era of transparency in clothing production. The concept was simple, the introduction of QR codes on tags found on clothing. Scanning the code on the label with a mobile phone takes the user to a webpage containing all of the information relating to the factory that produced the garment. &apos;Made in Thailand&apos; suddenly appears so vague. Monkey Inferno will launch the concept as a not for profit. The judges, while welcoming the idea, thought that Morgan Sowden&apos;s worthy idea wouldn&apos;t particularly benefit from an endorsement by the Guardian Activate Summit. Emma Murphy, a Cambridge graduate with an extensive experience in the conservation sector presented her prototype app Jungle Fever. The game transforms the casual player into a jungle manager, helping conserve the environment and wildlife within their virtual world while making a genuine impact on the real world. A percentage of the revenue raised from the game will be used to fund the conservation of the rainforests in Borneo. The judges loved the concept but felt that it was too early to be presented to those attending the Guardian Activate Summit. Paul Reeve, a software engineer presented his own app, Story. The app sits somewhere between apps like Instagram and Tumblr, allowing users to create mini &apos;stories&apos; based on photographs taken by users. While the judges liked the concept, some were concerned that Paul hadn&apos;t heard of the fast growing Storify app and that it might take some time to gain critical mass. There is, rather confusingly, another app called Story that is currently available. The winners Daan Weddepohl, from Amsterdam presented his business, Peerby. Already having achieved critical mass in Amsterdam, Peerby offers users the chance to borrow items ranging from lawnmowers to digital cameras from their neighbours. In order to de-risk the process, and speed up the return of items, the borrower has to pay a daily insurance premium to Peerby, thus increasing the likelihood of the process taking place. Peerby also intends to generate revenue through &apos;product placement&apos;, in other words the camera you are &apos;borrowing&apos; might actually be lent to you by the manufacturer to try before you buy. The judges unanimously felt that Peerby was the best business proposition that we were presented although there were some reservations about the percentage of users who might leach, borrow but not lend. However, we felt that young, urban users would be willing to use this service as a means of connecting with the neighbours they had never spoken to. Indeed I sat through the presentation wishing that Peerby was live in London so that I could borrow some equipment for my small garden from my neighbours who I&apos;ve barely even seen. The judges therefore believed that Peerby provided a social good, although clearly for the first world. If Peerby helped the first world, then Libby Powell, the founder of Radar, our joint winner, provided a social good for communities across the developed and the developing world. This ground breaking charity helps locate, train and nurture a growing network of citizen journalists, often located in some of the least accessible and developed parts of the world. Libby explained how over the last six months Radar has project &quot;withstood the heat of two national African elections&quot; and supported supported over 250 citizen mobile reporters to news alerts via SMS from their locations. Radar then turned these on the ground reports into mainstream news stories, working with the media for free. Perhaps the most admirable part of Radar&apos;s proposition was the founders&apos; practicality, having learnt how to manage these globally distributed networks, the charity earns revenue from consulting for a variety of organisations, charities and businesses including the British government. Every single one of my fellow judges felt split on whether the team behind Peerby or Radar should win the right to present their concept to the main Guardian Activate event. Having decided that they each would appeal to different delegates, we agreed the only sensible option was to award the prize to both. That&apos;s something you&apos;d rarely see on a reality TV show!

He was tall, slim and naturally funny, always meticulous in his movement and perfect in his articulation. He reminded me of an elegant bird \u2013 a heron, perhaps, or a flamingo. His eyes twinkled as much as they burned. He slowed things down, rather than speeded them up, but his slowness and deliberation were always an exemplary demonstration of good timing and manners as a performer. In the mid-1970s, he was the go-to actor for Asian parts in new plays in the Royal Court&apos;s Theatre Upstairs, and it was always a guarantee of an element of class and distinction in the show that night if his name was on the bill. Bhattacharjee was last seen on 10 July leaving a rehearsal for a new play in the same building in Sloane Square, London, part of the new artistic director Vicky Featherstone&apos;s Open Court weekly rep season in which he had already played the president of Georgia. His body was found two days later in East Sussex He was the only son of Gautam Bhattacharjee, a software researcher who was a member of the Communist party in India and was forced to leave the country after his part in the naval mutiny of 1942. In Britain, Gautam met Anne, who was herself from a migrant family of Russian Jews, and their son, Paul, was educated at state schools in Harrow, Middlesex. In his teens, Paul was involved in anti-racist campaigns in London and met Verma, who became his great friend and mentor, in workshops they both attended in Southall. Verma recognised from the start a fellow spirit whose highly developed social conscience was linked to a remarkable artistic imagination. Tara Arts, Britain&apos;s first Asian theatre company, was formed by Verma in 1977 and Bhattacharjee was an actor and director with them over the next 10 years, notably in Yes, Memsahib (1979), which documented the formation of modern east Africa by colonial Indian &quot;coolie&quot; labour; Diwali (1980), which he directed, an epic story set against the annual festival of lights; Meet Me (1983), which highlighted mental illness in the Asian community; and The Little Clay Cart (1984), a delightful adaptation by Verma of an eighth-century classic as a fable on poverty and revolution. One of his most crucial roles was that of Gandhi in a play Verma wrote, and Anthony Clark directed, for the Edinburgh festival fringe in 1982. Gandhi emerged in this play as the first modern Asian, Verma said, in the way we understand such a definition. The impression this experience made on Bhattacharjee never left him and informed his entire subsequent career. He showed up tellingly in Murmuring Judges, the second of David Hare&apos;s &quot;state of the nation&quot; trilogy, at the National Theatre in 1991, but gravitated more naturally towards the RSC, where he played leading roles in John Marston&apos;s The Malcontent, the disputed Shakespearean history Edward III and Philip Massinger&apos;s The Roman Actor in the Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon, season of 2002 which Thelma Holt and Bill Kenwright later presented in the West End. In the next two years he gave major leading performances as the dyspeptic, limping paterfamilias in a brilliant 2003 Young Vic revival of Harold Brighouse&apos;s Hobson&apos;s Choice, relocated to modern day Salford by Tanika Gupta and director Richard Jones, and as a very funny Malvolio in a 2004 West End Twelfth Night set in Kerala in southern India. But perhaps his most unusual and remarkable performance was in Complicite&apos;s ensemble production, directed by Simon McBurney, of A Disappearing Number (2007), in which the mystery of maths at the highest level turned out to be a thing of real beauty. The hinge of the dramatic dissertation was the friendship, around the time of the first world war, between the Cambridge mathematician GH Hardy, who believed that mathematicians were only makers of patterns, like poets and painters, and the Brahmin vegetarian autodidact Srinivasa Ramanujan. The air of magical contrivance was sustained by encasing this friendship in the expositions of a narrator physicist \u2013 played by Bhattacharjee \u2013 and a Hardy disciple many years later. Having toured with this highly acclaimed production to festivals in Vienna and Amsterdam, in 2008 he plunged into two years of EastEnders, before returning to the RSC in Dominic Cooke&apos;s Arabian Nights (2009) and the Much Ado with Syal which, in its modern Mumbai setting and gorgeous colouring, was an update, perhaps, on the famous 1976 RSC production (Judi Dench and Donald Sinden) set in the last days of the Indian Raj. In the past decade he had appeared regularly, also, at the Tricycle theatre in Kilburn in Nicolas Kent&apos;s series of verbatim documentary dramas, notably as Moazzam Begg, one of the detainees of the US military in Guantanamo (2004), and in The Great Game: Afghanistan (2009) cycle of short plays and the two-part meditation on the nuclear threat, The Bomb (2012).

But as You Am I tour the country in celebration of 20 years together, the band also has something different to offer fans: their own beer. Brew Am I \u2013 created with Newtown brewery Young Henrys \u2013 is just the latest examples of collaborative brewing, a trend that has been sweeping the Australian beer scene. It was 2011 when Melbourne\u2019s Mountain Goat Beer\u00a0first joined forces with leading British craft brewer Thornbridge to create the Thorny Goat Black IPA. The brewery has since hooked up with New York\u2019s Brooklyn Brewery, Danish brewer Mikkeller, and musicians Henry Wagons and Mick Thomas (Weddings, Parties, Anything). Other Australian brewers meanwhile, have released beers conceived with writers, surfers, chefs, rockers and coffee roasters. For Young Henrys\u2019 head brewer Richard Adamson, the You Am I venture is merely the latest in a series of \u201crockstar\u201d brews that began with Sydney\u2019s Crow and Front End Loader last year and saw three new band collaborations beers launched at a raucous closing event for the recent Good Beer Week festival at Cherry Bar.\u00a0 But do these collaborations create great new beers \u2013 or are they merely smart marketing ploys? Adamson says there genuine benefits from seeking ideas outside the brewery; that collaborating broadens the experience for both the brewers in the brewery and for those drinking the beer. \u201cIn every beer we have made in collaboration, the resulting beer is not something we would have come up with ourselves,\u201d he says. Ben Kraus of Beechworth\u2019s Bridge Road Brewers, who has brewed several beers with European brewers and created a Bar Series with staff from many of Australia\u2019s leading beer venues, admits that \u201cthere\u2019s obviously marketing and exposure.\u201d But, he says the benefits go beyond that. \u201cOur collaboration with [Norwegian] N\u00f8gne \u00d8 has ended up on tap in Barcelona and Amsterdam \u2013 I knew nothing about it [going there]. But you also get to learn how other people brew, how and why they do things, compare ideas and take some things on board.\u201d And some collaborations do give brilliant, unique results. The Bridge Road/N\u00f8gne \u00d8 India Saison \u2013 which came about through the two brewers love of saisons (a French/Belgian farmhouse style) and Kraus\u2019 ability to source Australian hops not then available in Europe \u2013 is first rate. The unique Gypsy &amp; the Goat, featuring native pepperberry, from Mountain Goat and Mikkeller was rated one of the best beers of 2012. But how involved individual collaborators become tends to vary case by case. In some cases, guest brewers might offer little more than recipe input and a cursory nod at the mash tun on brew day, while in others collaborators have milled grain at dawn and really earned their knock-off beer several hours later. In the case of Brew Am I, the beer was named by singer Tim Rogers and conceived by bassist Andy Kent with Adamson to represent the band\u2019s origins \u2013 wheat from WA, malt from Victoria, hops from New Zealand \u2013 but also to serve a particular purpose. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s a beer that goes with rock\u2018n\u2019roll,\u201d says Kent. \u201cYou need to be able to drink it from the first song, get as much down your throat as people do at gigs, and still want more after the encore.\u201d When non-brewers are invited into breweries they also often set challenges that test the skills of the brewer. For a media brew competition at last year&apos;s Beervana NZ festival, I came up with the idea of a smoked Belgian imperial mussel and oyster stout. It was the genius of Murray&apos;s Brewing&apos;s head brewer thar turned a disaster-in-waiting into a competition-winning beer. \u201cYou get some interesting ideas,\u201d says Kraus. \u201cWe had some really good experiences using oak, spirits and chocolate in the beers for the Bar Series and got to trial new hops that have led us to change the recipe of existing beers.\u201d Three unusual collaborations Aurora Borealis/Aurora Australis by Bridge Road and N\u00f8gne \u00d8Ben Kraus and Norway\u2019s Kjetil Jikiun brewed two batches of a 14% plus Belgian ale on either side of the world, placed them inside barrels (pinot noir in Australia, whisky in Norway) and sent them unrefrigerated by sea across the globe. A couple of barrels exploded along the way. They\u2019re now doing another using Port and Cognac barrels. Our Anchovia by The Wheatsheaf Hotel and Birra del BorgoLeading Italian brewer Leo di Vicenzo agreed to brew a one-off with Adelaide\u2019s leading beer bar earlier this year. Based on a pun of his famous collaboration with US superstars Dogfish Head, My Antonia, it used actual anchovies \u2013 and there are rumours it could happen again on a larger scale.

The two have wildly different ideas about democratic accountability and how to measure success, says Alexander Stevenson, author of Public Sector: Managing the Unmanageable. And while the public sector is indeed quick to adopt private sector ideas, vocabulary and even people, the favour is rarely returned even though public sector managers are expert persuaders used to complex decision-making, he adds. &quot;It does not mean managing directors of private companies are incapable of offering useful advice to their public sector counterparts but, given the distinct and more complex challenges faced by the latter, it means that, if anything, public managers should be offering advice to the private sector more often than the other way around.&quot; Nevertheless, Nemat Shafik, deputy managing director for the IMF, told Public Leaders at the Global Public Leaders Summit, that it&apos;s the &quot;interface between private sector and policy that makes big changes to the world.&quot; In June 2013, the UK government launched a best practice guide that set out 16 key commitments to encourage better working between the public and private sector. Pledges include having a single point of contact on a project and to ensure efficient use of time, transparency and good communication. But it is secondments that will get to the root of better working relationships argues Mark Gibson, chief executive of the Whitehall and Industry Group and former senior civil servant. But they require a full commitment and long term perspective from all those involved. &quot;The skills acquired \u2013 either understanding of business or of government \u2013 are applied throughout the remainder of a career.

We want to know: \u2022 What qualities and skills are unique to the public sector, and the private sector. What do they have in common? \u2022 Do private sector managers believe they are superior to their public sector counterparts? What can they learn from the public sector? \u2022 Is the public sector&apos;s view of the private sector hampering good partnerships? \u2022 How can employers retain their newly skilled employees after secondments? \u2022 What are the good examples of collaborative innovation? What have we learnt from past mistakes? How can public and private sector overcome their differing objectives to work together? \u2022 Is there any reason why the thinking in the public and private sector should be any different?

Momentarily, the sign seems to lose faith in its own endeavour: two more neon letters flicker into life, and for a few seconds it reads \u201cThe future was here.\u201d That sense of uncertainty sets the tone for a show that doesn&apos;t quite seem sure whether it is declaring a revolutionary paradigm shift, or displaying passing fads that have already been superseded \u2013 or at least might be by the time it closes its doors in three months. \u201cWe were only able to scratch the surface,\u201d says curator Alex Newson. \u201cWe&apos;re trying to ask questions and give people prompts. There&apos;s no way this can be a definitive overview in an area that&apos;s moving so quickly.\u201d Tackling such a fluid topic, the show takes on an ad hoc feel. In one corner, a live &quot;factory&quot; with a laser-cutter, 3D-printers and a vinyl cutter, will be bravely operated by untrained front-of-house staff. \u201cWe wanted to see how easy it is to master these machines,\u201d says Newson. \u201cIs it possible to become a designer-maker over a six-week period?\u201d An adjacent shelf of their creations suggests not. Outputs so far include a pair of MDF sunglasses and plastic cartoon creatures \u2013 the desktop manufacturing equivalent of those heady days trying out fonts and clip-art when you first encountered a word processor. The difference is, everyone can type \u2013 but can most people design?     Mass customisation \u2026 exhibition plinth showing some of the mi adidas range alongside CNC plywood furniture. Photograph: Design Museum    The democratisation of design and production is central to the show, which traces the increasing levels of customisation being offered in consumer products. A mind-boggling display shows every possible component of a pair of trainers that customers can determine in the mi adidas\u00a0range \u2013 yes, that neon leopard-skin combo can finally be yours! Nike launched a similar personalisation initiative more than a decade ago. It famously backfired in 2001, when a customer ordered the word \u201csweatshop\u201d embroidered on their sneakers. Brands and democracy don&apos;t always make happy bedfellows. User subversion is a problem unlikely to be faced by the Makiedolls\u00a0on an adjacent plinth. Makielab is a young startup company that offers the chance to specify the eyes, nose, mouth, hair and outfit of your bespoke doll. The website also allows you to tweak its facial features with a series of sliders, in a form of parametric eugenics\u00a0\u2013 although, try as you might, you can&apos;t get rid of their sinister wide-eyed stare. The dolls are allegedly aimed at children, but the \u00a360 price tag suggests they will probably remain in the realm of adult collectibles for a while yet. Such cost implications of localised manufacture is something the exhibition frustratingly skims over. Unlike most toy brands, assembled by production lines of low-paid workers in China, Makiedolls are crafted in London and Amsterdam. Far fewer people are involved, and 3D-printing promises affordable mass-customisation \u2013 but the human salary costs are incomparable. With a shift in the geography of production (the hailed return to decentralised cottage industries) will we finally have to pay the real value of what things are worth? We may revive William Morris&apos;s craft utopia yet.     Makiedolls \u2026 choose their eyes, nose, mouth and hair in a process of parametric eugenics. Photograph: Makiedolls    There is also the unanswered question of how far such customisation is actually being called for. \u201cConsumers want, and are demanding, a bigger input into the creative process behind their products,\u201d insists Newson, as he shows me designs by Assa Ashuach\u00a0\u2013 including novelty biros and lemon squeezers\u00a0\u2013 that allow a certain level of user manipulation online, before being printed in the colour of your choice.\u00a0His gaudy collection looks like an Alessi shop with genetic malfunction \u2013 and I wonder quite how many consumers have the desire to improve on the geometries of lemon-juicing.\u00a0A recent survey, commissioned from Ipsos Mori for this exhibition, reveals that only 20% of people would like more input into the design of their household items, while only 6% would be interested in owning a 3D-printer. David Bott of the Technology Strategy Board, the government&apos;s innovation agency that collaborated on the show, thinks we all have an innate consumerist desire to have something unique. \u201cThe first industrial revolution was about being able to make thousands of the same thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now everyone&apos;s got one of everything, they want one that&apos;s different from their neighbours. It&apos;s not going to do away with factories, but it will satisfy the need of people to have things that are theirs alone.\u201d Though that attitude risks leading to yet more plastic tat \u2013 the trinkety baubles that fill the pages of 3D-printing marketplaces like Shapeways\u00a0and Thingiverse\u00a0\u2013 the exhibition also deals with the idea of long-life products and \u201cemotionally durable design\u201d. A solid aluminium toaster, projected to work for 100 years, sits alongside a concept by Forum for the Future for a Wandular, a digital \u201ccore\u201d hard drive that travels with you, from child&apos;s toy to piece of jewellery, designed to be cherished like a favourite watch rather than replaced every few years. Here, myth and reality blur confusingly, with little distinction between speculative ideas and designs that are in production. Next to these dreamy visions are a pair of biodegradable trainers \u2013 which are already available to buy, wear out, then throw on the compost heap.     Your perfect pen? \u2026 user-manipulated pens and lemon squeezers designed by Assa Ashuach. Photograph: Assa Ashuach    The show brims with such concepts and gadgets: there is a connected lightbulb, which knows when it will need a replacement part and sends off for one in advance. There is a sofa with a crowd-sourced design, that is made in batches by a network of manufacturers to keep costs down. And there is the work of Wikihouse and Open Desk, which imagine an open-source world of designs shared online and made by local producers. As John Maynard Keynes asserted, \u201cIt&apos;s easier to ship recipes than cake and biscuits\u201d. There is a wealth of brilliant ideas, but the overriding sense of wonder is dimmed by the fact that not a lot of the designs on show are particularly good. Facit homes\u00a0declare a brave new future of houses made onsite by a portable CNC-milling machine, which rocks up in its own shipping container to cut everything from the frame to flooring and facade. Yet the resulting bespoke homes have all the boxy charm of a cheap prefab \u2013 at a vastly inflated cost. From housing to furniture, why must the open-source aesthetic resort to plywood clunkiness, and reduce customised domestic products to plasticky kitsch? In many cases, the radical process is in danger of being fetishised to the detriment of good design. But, as Bott concludes, the most useful functions of 3D-printing might not be particularly glamorous \u2013 or even visible. \u201cI see a big future in replacement parts,\u201d he says. \u201cWithin five years, you&apos;ll be able to go round the corner and get a pump printed for your washing machine, rather than waiting six weeks for a delivery.\u201d Let&apos;s hope they don&apos;t ask you to customise your pump with a jaunty coloured twist.", "sentences": ["Unlike most toy brands, assembled by production lines of low-paid workers in China, Makiedolls are crafted in London and Amsterdam."], "title": "Is DIY design more than a passing fad?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/jul/24/design-museum-diy-3d-printing", "tags": ["Design", "Technology", "3D printing", "Manufacturing sector", "Business", "Culture", "Exhibitions", "Art and design", "Technology startups", "Toys", "Life and style", "Gadgets"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-07-24T15:31:49Z", "article": "FINALLY PUTTING TWO AND \u00a339,999,999 TOGETHER What do you think they&apos;re smoking over there at Emirates?

Caroline Criado-Perez started a battle on this principle: if the Bank of England wanted to take Elizabeth Fry, the only woman on any banknote, off the fiver, it had to replace her with another woman. We couldn&apos;t live in a society that was only prepared to celebrate the achievements of men. What kind of a message is that to the nation, that the only declaration of legacy people will see most days, the only open declaration many of us will ever notice, includes no women?

Meanwhile, there was something interesting going on in the Council of Europe (I know, there&apos;s a sentence you may not have read very often). It held a conference in Amsterdam on gender equality, in which Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism Project \u2013 so far 25,000 women have tweeted examples of often eye-popping misogyny \u2013 gave evidence. Her highest-profile campaign recently has been to get Facebook to apply its own moderator-standards \u2013 the rules it uses to prevent racism and anti-semitism on the site \u2013 to images of violence against women. As she points out in a brilliant video: &quot;There are images of women being raped, being killed, being tortured, pictures of\u00a0women with black eyes and bloodied faces with the caption, &apos;Next time, don&apos;t get pregnant&apos;.&quot; Facebook, with that distinctive, MBA, small-c conservatism, will come down hard on abuse if it can see itself getting bad press over it, but cannot make a moral decision of its own about whether or not a joke about violence towards women might be equivalent to a joke about violence towards a particular race. Bates thought laterally and approached the companies that advertised on Facebook. Some \u2013 Nissan UK, Nationwide UK \u2013 pulled their ads. Others didn&apos;t. Facebook&apos;s response was spineless. This fight is ongoing, but back to Europe\u2026 Following Bates&apos;s and other testimony, on 10 July the Council of Europe made a set of recommendations (which it announced this week): member states should adopt an &quot;appropriate legal framework&quot; that would ensure &quot;respect for the principle of human dignity and the prohibition of all discrimination on grounds of sex&quot;, as well as of incitement to hatred and to any form of gender-based violence within the media. Naturally, the Council of Europe doesn&apos;t have the power to enforce it; and David Cameron, with his craven fear of the attack-labrador Europhobes in his party, will probably not simply reject the recommendations, but use his rejection of them as a calling card. The opposition to the call will be hideous to behold, uniting all the people who hate Europe &quot;telling us what to do&quot; with the people who treasure, above most things, their right to make hilarious jokes about rape; and what a cesspit that will be (hang on \u2013 unless this is not a Venn diagram at all, but a picture of one circle overlapping entirely with another circle?). But this is potentially huge: imagine some crazy future, some post-angry time, when people listen to sustained argument and take it seriously. This &quot;respect&quot; would go far beyond Facebook. How could the Sun defend page 3 from the charge that it discriminated on grounds of sex? How could lads&apos; mags exist; what would happen to the Sunday Sport? The landscape of the printed media in the UK would change completely. And it would change because of Laura Bates and Everyday Sexism; because of Kat Banyard, and Lose the Lads Mags; because of Lucy-Anne Holmes and No More Page Three; because of Caroline Criado-Perez and her campaign on banknotes; it would change because of the 34,000 who signed the Bank of England petition, the\u00a0220,000 who tweeted about the Facebook campaign. Two things are unarguable about this century; the first is that it is more sexist than the end of the last, raunch and postmodernism having converged to normalise the presentation of women as meat; the second is that the internet has had profound consequences for privacy and, inevitably, personal freedom. But pause to consider the vivacity of the feminist fourth wave, its energy and victories, the way it has honed and deployed the power of social media rather than surrendered to the misogynist tropes it throws up. It is fearless and pugnacious and alive with a sense of possibility. Campaigning is better than it was in the 90s or the noughties; it is more determined, its weapons are more lethal; it is Buffy to yesteryear&apos;s Mary Poppins.

Luckily, however, Su\u00e1rez has discovered that none of those things exist in London and so he&apos;s decided that he wants to go to those fellow wind-up merchants, Arsenal, even though Brendan Rodgers has been busy telling the Uruguayan that the good people of Liverpool have treated himself like a son of themselves, standing by him like irresponsible parents refusing to admonish their beloved offspring during his various scandals. Luis burnt down next door&apos;s shed? Well you&apos;d have to ask what the shed was doing there in the first place and whether or not it insulted Luis first. It seems that people have taken note of Arsenal&apos;s comedy antics the other day.

Su\u00e1rez believes he is entitled to leave said club. The employer continues to say no and the employee calls in his lawyers. For Liverpool 2013 read Groningen 2007, and a reminder of how the striker has mastered implausible escapes off the field as well as on. The Uruguay forward has not taken legal action against Liverpool since Arsenal&apos;s \u00a340,000,001 bid was declined on Tuesday but, in the absence of an offer that tempts the Anfield club to sell and ends the stand-off over a disputed clause in his contract, the possibility of arbitration remains. He has previous and the warning for Liverpool is that, even when he loses, Su\u00e1rez can win. Six years ago, following a season of impressive individual performances, goals and disciplinary problems for Groningen (another parallel?), Su\u00e1rez was the subject of a \u20ac3.5m bid from Ajax. The Eredivisie club insisted the offer did not reflect the striker&apos;s market value and were eventually taken to court by their player and his representatives. &quot;Their case was that he should be allowed to join Ajax for financial and sporting improvement,&quot; recalled a Groningen spokesman. &quot;At that time we thought it was the idea of his management team and not Luis Su\u00e1rez himself. It was not the same agent or management team that he has now. The financial reason for joining Ajax was dismissed by the court because we had made him the offer of a new contract and there was not much difference between our new offer and Ajax&apos;s offer. As for sporting reasons, the court ruled that when you are playing in the same competition there is no change apart from wearing a different shirt. The competition and the rules of the competition are still the same. Liverpool and Arsenal are both in the Premier League so in Holland they would rule there is no difference.&quot; Victory to Groningen \u2013 to an extent. On the same day the court ruled in the club&apos;s favour, Ajax submitted an improved offer of \u20ac7.5m for Su\u00e1rez and, with bridges burned and supporters turning against him, the striker got his transfer to Amsterdam. &quot;We didn&apos;t have to let him go at that time because the court said we were right,&quot; Groningen&apos;s spokesman insists. &quot;It was only afterwards, when Ajax made a better offer, and we decided it was the best offer, that we decided to do the deal.&quot; Arbitration would appear a fruitless route for Su\u00e1rez in his search for Champions League football away from Liverpool. Any hearing, either by a Premier League regulatory commission or in court, would not take place before this summer&apos;s transfer window closes. Officially at least, they remain pragmatic about Su\u00e1rez&apos;s bitter departure at his first European club. The Groningen official added: &quot;It was unusual for us but it had happened to other clubs before. It&apos;s the way it goes sometimes. When he decided he needed to do that, or his management wanted to go that way, we had to be prepared for a court case and we were.

This hotel &quot;edits out&quot; what it regards as unwanted extras, so if you want breakfast in your PJs you pay \u00a36 extra and it&apos;s delivered, in a box, the night before.

The building used to be magistrates&apos; chambers, and one cannot help feeling slightly awestruck at the baroque grandeur of the marble and alabaster lobby. A former cell in the basement has been turned into a spa steam room, there is a cocktail bar on the ground floor, and the first-floor restaurant is in yet more opulent surroundings, with oak panelling and ornate plasterwork.\u2022 01332\u00a0546080, thefinessecollection.com.

Not an obvious choice, perhaps, for inclusion in a boutique hotel selection, but the brand is so cool, it is an experience in its own right. Pod-like rooms have been modelled on first-class aeroplane cabins, with a techno-wall screen from which to order food and create a personalised music playlist.

Back in May, this 72-room, no-frills hotel opened on the site of a former Travelodge on Shandwick Place, and you couldn&apos;t be better placed to discover Edinburgh. The city handsomely rewards walkers, whether strolling along the Water of Leith to the Botanic Gardens, the bars and cafes of Stockbridge, exploring the ordered elegance of the New Town, or heading up to the castle and the historic Grassmarket.

There are just seven rooms-with-a-view on offer here, including a family room. The modern motel has been created in a former trad hotel beside the A84 north of Callander, the largest town in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park.

There is so much to love about this small, former shipbuilding town in the west of Wales, with its characteristic pastel houses and dainty harbour. And this month, the Castle Hotel, which has six simple rooms (a mix of doubles and twins), relaunches its restaurant with new menus that put Cardigan Bay produce at their heart.

The man, wearing a mask and gloves and carrying a briefcase, strolled into a diamond exhibition at the Carlton hotel just before midday, threatened staff and visitors and filled the case with jewels and diamond-encrusted watches before walking out. &quot;It was all over very quickly. There was no violence,&quot; a French police officer said. The thief entered the hotel alone, but police said they believed he had an accomplice waiting outside. It is the third significant jewel theft from hotels in the Cannes area in just over two months. During the Cannes film festival in May, thieves stole more than \u00a3660,000 worth of jewellery belonging to the exclusive Swiss jeweller and watchmaker Chopard. The gems were to have been loaned to A-list film stars and celebrities attending the festival, and were in a safe in a room at the Suite Novotel in Cannes. The thieves removed the whole safe in the middle of the night without forcing the room&apos;s door or using a keycard, according to police. A week later a necklace reportedly worth \u20ac1.9m by the Swiss jeweller De Grisogono vanished after a celebrity party at the five-star Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in the resort town of Cap d&apos;Antibes. Police are investigating whether the raids were the work of the same gang. &quot;Thieves see Cannes as rich pickings,&quot; said a police officer with the crime squad in Nice, which is investigating the raid. &quot;A full and urgent operation is under way to catch the culprit and recover these jewels.&quot; Another police officer told the Nice Matin newspaper: &quot;The raid took place in broad daylight at a time when hundreds of tourists were enjoying the sunshine. It could not have been more daring. The thief took advantage of the crowds and the fact it was Sunday and the atmosphere was relaxed.&quot; Police refused to say whether they were linking the raid with the escape of a member of the notorious Pink Panther gang from a Swiss jail on Thursday. Milan Poparic fled with another inmate from Orbe prison, in the western Swiss state of Vaud, after his accomplices rammed a prison gate and overpowered guards with bursts from their AK-47 automatic rifles. Police said he was the third member of the Pink Panthers to have escaped in as many months. Interpol believes that the group has been targeting luxury watch, gem and jewellery stores in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the United States since 1999 and has netted more than \u20ac330m. The stolen diamonds had been on show since 20 July and were supposed to remain at the Carlton until the end of August in an exhibition called Extraordinary Diamonds, organised by the prestigious Leviev diamond house owned by the Russian-born Israeli billionaire Lev Leviev. Leviev, 57, who is described as a diamond dealer, businessman and philanthropist, owns diamond mines in Russia and Africa and is a major competitor to the African diamond giant De Beers. The father-of-nine has a \u00a335m home in Hampstead and last year was involved in a high-profile high court battle against a former business partner, Arkady Gaydamak, which he won. Staff at the Carlton, situated on the exclusive Promenade de la Croisette, said they had been told not to give any information about the raid. Police unions criticised the practice of jewellery companies holding exhibitions in luxury hotels, saying they could not provide the necessary security to prevent thefts. In August 1994, a security guard was shot at the Carlton as he tried to stop thieves making off with gems in a similar exhibition. Europe&apos;s top heists \u2022 Harry Winston&apos;s jewellery store, in the chic Avenue Montaigne in Paris, December 2008, $107m (\u00a370m)haul. The biggest heist in French history. Just before closing time before Christmas, four men \u2013 three disguised as women with long blonde hair, sunglasses and scarves \u2013 were buzzed into the shop. Once in they set off a grenade in the shop and made off with gems, jewellery and watches.

Developed as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, many have argued that they are neither sustainable nor green. Critics have also examined the economic case and questioned whether biofuel production is currently cost effective. Criticism of the relationship between biofuels and development has been further supported by growing evidence of the link between biofuel production and food price spikes. Adding to these reservations is the issue of land rights: as the industry expands, how can we ensure these are preserved? But, last month&apos;s report  (pdf) on biofuels and food security by the UN CFS high level panel of experts on food security and nutrition, suggests it might be time to reconsider its benefits: employment and income opportunities, increased agricultural productivity, reduction of CO2 emissions and increased energy independence. But in its conclusions, the report&apos;s authors concede that &quot;the potential impact of biofuel policies and projects can differ widely according to national and local conditions and to the choice of specific technologies and feedstocks.&quot; So given all the conflicting evidence, is it time we ask not whether biofuels are fundamentally good or bad but how, in policy and practice, their cultivation can be green, equitable and sustainable? On what scale should biofuels be produced? Is effective technology or the evidence of social and economic impact what&apos;s missing? And as policymakers in the developed world consider fuel options for a sustainable future, how do we not lose sight of farmers and consumers in low and middle-income countries?

The task of motivating people within such an environment - even at middle/low levels - should be approached differently to reflect this. Ironically, in this area, public sector managers have an advantage which they must exploit. Think in terms of twins: I think it is interesting to think in terms of identical twins, one with a career in the public sector the other in the private. How would they be different? In my view, the public sector twin would have greater skills in negotiation, persuasion, handling complex decisions and crisis management. I think the private sector person would be more adept at making decisions quickly and delivery. Philip Marcel Karr\u00e9, lecturer in public administration and management at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences There is no public or private sector ideal: In both sectors you can find bureaucratic organizations. There is not one ideal-typical public organization and there is no ideal-typical private organization but a plethora of different organizational forms, each with its own problems and challenges. Also, the line between public and private is never as clear-cut as one might think (or hope). Hence there are many more hybrid, than fully public and fully private organizations. Private sector managers should be aware of politics: In its dealings with the public sector, the private sector often sees the former as an unreliable business partner exactly because of its inherently political nature. What has been decided one day, can change the next after an election or change in vision. Many in the private sector find this puzzling. So it can not hurt for private sector managers to develop some more political sensitivity. Alan Downey, head of public sector at KPMG and former civil servant Performance management shouldn&apos;t be a job for HR: My experience in the civil service (but it is now a long time ago) was that line managers did not often feel personally responsible for dealing with any underperformance by their team members. If someone performed badly, then the attitude was &quot;HR should deal with it&quot;, or alternatively the underperfomer should be shunted on to another posting asap. I have found that attitude to be less prevalent in the private sector. Taking a secondment? Why not change career permanently: Secondments can be very beneficial for both the secondee and for the sending and receiving organisations. But they are only part of the answer. There is also a lot to be said for more permanent moves between sectors. You get a much better sense of what it&apos;s like to work in a different environment if you make the commitment to give up your old job and take on a new one. I would say that, of course, because I moved from public to private after the first eight years of my career. Sean Hanson, partnership director for Serco&apos;s public sector outsourcing business Tackle inefficiency in both sectors: Inefficient and incompetent management practices in the private sector typically have much larger consequences for the individual (they will be fired) and for the organisation (they will go bust). I am seeing more and more convergence than there used to be on the consequences, however, with more public sector organisations dealing appropriately with poor performers. When someone does criticise the public sector for inefficiency and incompetence, I think we can all look to private sector examples that have hit the news and demonstrate that imcompetence is not a public sector characteristic, any more than it is a private sector characteristic. Secondments must be for the right reasons: Apologies for the football analogy, but if the purpose of &apos;loaning out&apos; a developing player is to give them more experience and to allow them to bring back ideas to complement your own team, it is clearly a great idea. But if it is to &apos;get the player off the books&apos; because their face no longer fits, it will usually only end up as a one way transaction, and not always to the benefit of the player or the receiving team. I am \u2013 probably wrongly \u2013 always suspicious of secondments and test the motivation of all parties. With the right motives they can be tremendous. Anthony Birch, Capita curriculum manager for Civil Service Learning How to run a successful partnership contract: It is about constantly reinforcing both internally and externally our shared goal that we are pursuing together and pointing up the successes whenever and wherever possible; large contracts will have &apos;leakage&apos; - not recognising this is naive at best - but being careful not to throw the visionary baby out with the &apos;dirty bathwater&apos; each time there is a hiccup in the service (but acknowledging when/if it does happen) and maintaining a positive mental attitude is something that is integral to our collaboration. Gillian Fawcett, head of public sector for ACCA Global Understand differences: I think that there are two key distinctions which need to be made between the private and public sector. Public services in most cases deliver complex services where outcomes are difficult to design, measure and monitor. In most cases they address complex social and health issues. Also, descisions in the public sector are generally driven by the short-term political cycle, whereas the private sector has its eye on the medium and long term. These differences need to be understood if a partnership/collaboration is to have a chance of success. Network across sector boundaries: I think there are more informal ways of sharing good practice and networking between the sectors. At ACCA for example, we bring together private and the public sector individuals at policy events and conferences. We make sure that our members have cross-sectoral opportunities to engage not just at the local an national levels, but internationally too. It does require a lot of time and effort but the results are worth it. Nahdia Khan, head of executive development at The Whitehall &amp; Industry Group Planning is key to a successful secondment: Before someone undertakes a secondment the organisation needs to be clear why they are sending one of their executives out on secondment \u2013 if it is to acquire or augment a new skill then what are they going to do ensure that the individual comes back to a role that will utilise these skills. Sector stereotypes are less common than you might think: The consistent feedback from our private sector colleagues has been that they absolutely recognise the complexities of operating in the public sector and they are genuinely very complimentary of the real quality and talent of people working in the public sector. WIG has been working for 30 years to combat stereotyping on both sides, we have found that through learning together to learn is the most positive way of encouraging good partnerships. \u2022 Want your say?

First, there was Ingo Metzmacher&apos;s visceral, in-your-face performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican in London last May. Now at the Proms we have charismatic Thomas S\u00f8nderg\u00e5rd and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales offering a more measured, if equally formidable interpretation that took a striking approach to the score&apos;s ambiguities. Premiered in 1957, the symphony ostensibly charts the suppression by tsarist forces of the 1905 revolution and the galvanising effect of this on Russian political consciousness. But Shostakovich hinted that the work was a response to the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, while the Mussorgskian bells at the end hint at the perpetuation of tyranny rather than revolutionary change. Whether that final triumph is real or vacuous depends on the conductor. S\u00f8nderg\u00e5rd seemingly sees the piece in terms of how fanaticism breeds from violence: after the horror of massacres and the intensity of formal lamentation, the finale, far from being eruptive, had the steady tread and weight of a juggernaut obliterating everything opposing its path. The BBCNOW played it as though possessed, too. The first half of the programme \u2013 the UK premiere of Colin Matthews&apos;s Turning Point and Prokofiev&apos;s Second Violin Concerto \u2013 didn&apos;t quite have the same force. Turning Point, first heard in Amsterdam in 2007, links an elaborate scherzo with slowly moving chordal music that gradually comes to dominate the entire work: the ecstatic, richly detailed woodwind and brass writing has overtones of Mahler and Berg. It was beautifully done. Daniel Hope was the dark-toned soloist in the Prokofiev, less overtly refined than some interpreters in the great central Andante, but dexterous, witty and intense elsewhere. \u2022 Did you catch this gig \u2013 or any other recently?

The NSA boasts in training materials that the program, called XKeyscore, is its &quot;widest-reaching&quot; system for developing intelligence from the internet. The latest revelations will add to the intense public and congressional debate around the extent of NSA surveillance programs. They come as senior intelligence officials testify to the Senate judiciary committee on Wednesday, releasing classified documents in response to the Guardian&apos;s earlier stories on bulk collection of phone records and Fisa surveillance court oversight.  The files shed light on one of Snowden&apos;s most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by the Guardian on June 10. &quot;I, sitting at my desk,&quot; said Snowden, could &quot;wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email&quot;. US officials vehemently denied this specific claim. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee, said of Snowden&apos;s assertion: &quot;He&apos;s lying. It&apos;s impossible for him to do what he was saying he could do.&quot; But training materials for XKeyscore detail how analysts can use it and other systems to mine enormous agency databases by filling in a simple on-screen form giving only a broad justification for the search. The request is not reviewed by a court or any NSA personnel before it is processed. XKeyscore, the documents boast, is the NSA&apos;s &quot;widest reaching&quot; system developing intelligence from computer networks \u2013 what the agency calls Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). One presentation claims the program covers &quot;nearly everything a typical user does on the internet&quot;, including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as their metadata. Analysts can also use XKeyscore and other NSA systems to obtain ongoing &quot;real-time&quot; interception of an individual&apos;s internet activity. Under US law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisa warrant only if the target of their surveillance is a &apos;US person&apos;, though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets. But XKeyscore provides the technological capability, if not the legal authority, to target even US persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information, such as their email or IP address, is known to the analyst. One training slide illustrates the digital activity constantly being collected by XKeyscore and the analyst&apos;s ability to query the databases at any time.     KS1 Photograph: Guardian    The purpose of XKeyscore is to allow analysts to search the metadata as well as the content of emails and other internet activity, such as browser history, even when there is no known email account (a &quot;selector&quot; in NSA parlance) associated with the individual being targeted. Analysts can also search by name, telephone number, IP address, keywords, the language in which the internet activity was conducted or the type of browser used. One document notes that this is because &quot;strong selection [search by email address] itself gives us only a very limited capability&quot; because &quot;a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous.&quot; The NSA documents assert that by 2008, 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from XKeyscore. Analysts are warned that searching the full database for content will yield too many results to sift through. Instead they are advised to use the metadata also stored in the databases to narrow down what to review. A slide entitled &quot;plug-ins&quot; in a December 2012 document describes the various fields of information that can be searched. It includes &quot;every email address seen in a session by both username and domain&quot;, &quot;every phone number seen in a session (eg address book entries or signature block)&quot; and user activity \u2013 &quot;the webmail and chat activity to include username, buddylist, machine specific cookies etc&quot;. Email monitoring In a second Guardian interview in June, Snowden elaborated on his statement about being able to read any individual&apos;s email if he had their email address. He said the claim was based in part on the email search capabilities of XKeyscore, which Snowden says he was authorized to use while working as a Booz Allen contractor for the NSA. One top-secret document describes how the program &quot;searches within bodies of emails, webpages and documents&quot;, including the &quot;To, From, CC, BCC lines&quot; and the &apos;Contact Us&apos; pages on websites&quot;. To search for emails, an analyst using XKS enters the individual&apos;s email address into a simple online search form, along with the &quot;justification&quot; for the search and the time period for which the emails are sought.     KS2 Photograph: Guardian         KS3edit2 Photograph: Guardian    The analyst then selects which of those returned emails they want to read by opening them in NSA reading software. The system is similar to the way in which NSA analysts generally can intercept the communications of anyone they select, including, as one NSA document put it, &quot;communications that transit the United States and communications that terminate in the United States&quot;. One document, a top secret 2010 guide describing the training received by NSA analysts for general surveillance under the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008, explains that analysts can begin surveillance on anyone by clicking a few simple pull-down menus designed to provide both legal and targeting justifications. Once options on the pull-down menus are selected, their target is marked for electronic surveillance and the analyst is able to review the content of their communications:     KS4 Photograph: Guardian    Chats, browsing history and other internet activity Beyond emails, the XKeyscore system allows analysts to monitor a virtually unlimited array of other internet activities, including those within social media. An NSA tool called DNI Presenter, used to read the content of stored emails, also enables an analyst using XKeyscore to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages.     KS55edit Photograph: Guardian    An analyst can monitor such Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen.     KS6 Photograph: Guardian    Analysts can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information, including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed.     KS7 Photograph: Guardian    As one slide indicates, the ability to search HTTP activity by keyword permits the analyst access to what the NSA calls &quot;nearly everything a typical user does on the internet&quot;.     KS8 Photograph: Guardian    The XKeyscore program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies.     KS9 Photograph: Guardian    The quantity of communications accessible through programs such as XKeyscore is staggeringly large. One NSA report from 2007 estimated that there were 850bn &quot;call events&quot; collected and stored in the NSA databases, and close to 150bn internet records. Each day, the document says, 1-2bn records were added. William Binney, a former NSA mathematician, said last year that the agency had &quot;assembled on the order of 20tn transactions about US citizens with other US citizens&quot;, an estimate, he said, that &quot;only was involving phone calls and emails&quot;.\u00a0A 2010 Washington Post article reported that &quot;every day, collection systems at the [NSA] intercept and store 1.7bn emails, phone calls and other type of communications.&quot; The XKeyscore system is continuously collecting so much internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content remains on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for 30 days. One document explains: &quot;At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.&quot; To solve this problem, the NSA has created a multi-tiered system that allows analysts to store &quot;interesting&quot; content in other databases, such as one named Pinwale which can store material for up to five years.\u00a0 It is the databases of XKeyscore, one document shows, that now contain the greatest amount of communications data collected by the NSA.     KS10 Photograph: Guaridan    In 2012, there were at least 41 billion total records collected and stored in XKeyscore for a single 30-day period.     KS11 Photograph: Guardian    Legal v technical restrictions While the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 requires an individualized warrant for the targeting of US persons, NSA analysts are permitted to intercept the communications of such individuals without a warrant if they are in contact with one of the NSA&apos;s foreign targets. The ACLU&apos;s deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer, told the Guardian last month that national security officials expressly said that a primary purpose of the new law was to enable them to collect large amounts of Americans&apos; communications without individualized warrants. &quot;The government doesn&apos;t need to &apos;target&apos; Americans in order to collect huge volumes of their communications,&quot; said Jaffer. &quot;The government inevitably sweeps up the communications of many Americans&quot; when targeting foreign nationals for surveillance. An example is provided by one XKeyscore document showing an NSA target in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and New York.     KS12 Photograph: Guardian    In recent years, the NSA has attempted to segregate exclusively domestic US communications in separate databases. But even NSA documents acknowledge that such efforts are imperfect, as even purely domestic communications can travel on foreign systems, and NSA tools are sometimes unable to identify the national origins of communications. Moreover, all communications between Americans and someone on foreign soil are included in the same databases as foreign-to-foreign communications, making them readily searchable without warrants. Some searches conducted by NSA analysts are periodically reviewed by their supervisors within the NSA. &quot;It&apos;s very rare to be questioned on our searches,&quot; Snowden told the Guardian in June, &quot;and even when we are, it&apos;s usually along the lines of: &apos;let&apos;s bulk up the justification&apos;.&quot; In a letter this week to senator Ron Wyden, director of national intelligence James Clapper acknowledged that NSA analysts have exceeded even legal limits as interpreted by the NSA in domestic surveillance. Acknowledging what he called &quot;a number of compliance problems&quot;, Clapper attributed them to &quot;human error&quot; or &quot;highly sophisticated technology issues&quot; rather than &quot;bad faith&quot;. However, Wyden said on the Senate floor on Tuesday: &quot;These violations are more serious than those stated by the intelligence community, and are troubling.&quot; In a statement to the Guardian, the NSA said: &quot;NSA&apos;s activities are focused and specifically deployed against \u2013 and only against \u2013 legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests. &quot;XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA&apos;s lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system. &quot;Allegations of widespread, unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are simply not true.\u00a0Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA&apos;s analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks \u2026 In addition, there are multiple technical, manual and supervisory checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from occurring.&quot; &quot;Every search by an NSA analyst is fully auditable, to ensure that they are proper and within the law. &quot;These types of programs allow us to collect the information that enables us to perform our missions successfully \u2013 to defend the nation and to protect US and allied troops abroad.&quot;", "sentences": ["An example is provided by one XKeyscore document showing an NSA target in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and New York."], "title": "XKeyscore: NSA tool collects 'nearly everything a user does on the internet'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data", "tags": ["The NSA files", "Surveillance", "NSA", "US news", "Privacy", "Internet", "Data protection", "Technology", "US politics", "World news", "US Congress"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-02T12:00:00Z", "article": "I am writing this column from Amsterdam, \u2013 I am there with my daughter Rose to celebrate her 18th birthday. Back in London, it is her sister Jean&apos;s 20th birthday today. My\u00a0elder children are children no longer. It is sometimes said that the tragedy of having children is that one day they have to grow up, but it occurs to me now how wrong that is. Young children are, undoubtedly, a special gift of creation. Even taking into account their propensity for exploding into furies, tears, tantrums and unfathomable fits of stubbornness, they are power grids pumping out positive energy. Also, their helplessness and neediness flatters the parents \u2013 we become heroes in their eyes, almost gods. At the moment, my six-year-old daughter, Louise, is going through a phase of father-worship, welling up with excitement every time I come home. But Rose and Jean are way beyond that phase. They have the wry cynicism about their parents that those who have seen through some or other clever illusion possess. I am well on the way to feeling tolerated as much as loved. I have not found this easy \u2013 Jean&apos;s transition from true believer to profound sceptic was especially painful, perhaps because it was my first experience of such a transition. However, it is a different kind of relationship, a more genuine one, rooted in a greater reality about who both parties are. Certainly there is often a difficult bridging period to go through, the teenage years, in which children separate from their parents. I have been relatively lucky in this \u2013 neither Rose nor Jean were particularly different from who they were as children as they negotiated adolescence. But the sense of your children becoming real people rather than &quot;your children&quot; is something that produces mixed feelings \u2013 an experience the parent no doubt shares with the child. Jean is rather less tolerant of my perceived faults than Rose. She is nevertheless someone whose company I enjoy greatly. She tells me that she considers me a friend and I take pleasure in her company because she provokes me and challenges me, and makes me laugh even when she&apos;s putting me on the defensive. This friendship is only possible because she doesn&apos;t see me through rose-tinted spectacles. This switch of world view from the idealised to the realistic is not an automatic process \u2013 it seems to me a lot of people hold on to an airbrushed view of their parents right up until they die and beyond. This is a way of not growing up, of still remaining dependent at some level. I thought a lot of my own father, but I never had any doubts that he was a flawed human being, not a hero. I learned as much from his faults as from his merits. Spending this week with Rose, I am aware that she, too, has become a friend. That means that the relationship has in many respects become a relationship of equals, a reciprocal arrangement. She is shedding light on the world for me, just as I once did for her. When we walk through the art museums and sculpture parks, her interpretations of the work impress me and enrich me (she is going to art college in September). We can walk through the streets of the red light district, the smell of dope in the air, and share the absurdity and sadness of the whole spectacle. When I look at Rose and Jean, though, I don&apos;t feel &quot;job done&quot; and pat myself on the back for producing such impressive daughters. The older I get, the more I realise I had almost nothing to do with producing their characters. They were who they were from the start \u2013 they just became more so. I tried to give them a stable upbringing and a rudimentary sense of justice, but otherwise, they are both their own work. I can only say that I am very happy that they have both done that work so well. \u2022 Follow Tim on Twitter @timlottwriter", "sentences": ["I am writing this column from Amsterdam, \u2013 I am there with my daughter Rose to celebrate her 18th birthday."], "title": "When adult children become your friends", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/02/grownup-children-become-parents-friends", "tags": ["Family", "Parents and parenting", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-02T14:07:29Z", "article": "An eclectic cast of cyclists \u2013 from London&apos;s mayor, Boris Johnson, to race organisers and Olympic champions \u2013 have hailed this weekend&apos;s RideLondon event in the capital as an important staging post in Britain&apos;s transition to a cycling nation. The event, which takes place over two days and climaxes on Sunday with the London-Surrey Classic 140-mile elite race featuring Team Sky and other professional riders and a 100-mile mass participation ride for 20,000 people, has been described as &quot;the London marathon on wheels&quot;. Both the elite and the mass participation events will start in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, close to the velodrome where Britain&apos;s riders delivered unprecedented success a year ago, and loop out into Surrey before finishing on the Mall. Organisers believe the ambitious event, which was hugely oversubscribed and also features a recreational family ride on the Saturday, will demonstrate the extent to which cycling&apos;s popularity has soared over the past decade. &quot;I think people are more and more turned on to cycling. There&apos;s been a massive change in people&apos;s attitudes to cycling generally. You still get some people who are very hostile but I think the public is now ready for the next great leap forwards,&quot; said Johnson, who has entered the 100-mile &quot;sportive&quot; event. &quot;I&apos;m not normally a Maoist in my approach to government, but what we need now is a revolution. I want people&apos;s mindset about cycling to be the same as you find in Amsterdam, or Berlin, or Copenhagen. There&apos;s no reason at all why we shouldn&apos;t.&quot; Hugh Brasher, the event organiser who is also race director of the London Marathon, said it was the largest inaugural mass participation event in the world, and the complexity of the various events \u2013 also including a handcycle race and a women&apos;s elite race \u2013 combined with the road closures made it a challenge to deliver. He said the event could not have happened a decade ago. A combination of serendipity, hard work and judgment had allowed British Cycling to create a virtuous circle between elite success and increased grassroots participation, he said. &quot;We&apos;re almost coming to a crescendo now: we won the Olympics pitch in 2005, then there was the success of the British cycling team in Beijing, which inspired people on the bikes. Now we have what London is doing as a city in terms of commuters, trying to be like Amsterdam. &quot;Then there was the success at London 2012 and Bradley Wiggins in the Tour de France. You&apos;ve got a whole host of things that come together. We couldn&apos;t be launching this at a better time. To an extent there&apos;s a bit of luck in that, but there&apos;s also a lot of planning.&quot; Jonny Clay, British Cycling&apos;s director of cyclesport, who won an Olympic bronze alongside Wiggins at the Sydney Games in 2000, could be among the first 100 finishers in Sunday&apos;s sportive. &quot;RideLondon is more evidence of the boom in cycling in this country \u2013 the sport has never been in better health. It is exactly the kind of event we want to encourage \u2013 one that is not just about elite competition but also helps to grow the sport,&quot; said Clay, adding that the number of sportives or challenge rides had surged 34% since 2012. There is confidence among those at the sharp end \u2013 entrepreneurs who have grown their businesses off the back of the recent boom in cycling \u2013 that it is sustainable. Nick Hussey, a fanatical cyclist for more than 20 years who now runs Vulpine, a firm selling casual cycling clothes, recounts his youthful impressions of the pursuit. &quot;It was a tiny, tiny sport and ultra cliquey, full of people who talked about gear ratios all weekend. Cyclists were basically racers or you rode to the shops. There wasn&apos;t much else.&quot; Now cycling has become so mainstream that shortly before he launched Vulpine a multinational sports company offered to buy up the entire concept, he said. &quot;They phoned me up and they said: &apos;We know that we don&apos;t get cycling and we don&apos;t have any authenticity. We need somebody to tell us how to do it.&apos;&quot; Hussey&apos;s firm is thriving, while a series of major clothing brands including Levi&apos;s and H&amp;M have launched their own bike-related ranges. Hussey says: &quot;Cycling 10 years ago was very male, very cliquey, geeky, full of sporty clothing. Now it&apos;s more of a lifestyle, an access route to various other kinds of enjoyment. The litmus test is if you open a fashion magazine. You know cycling is cool because Vogue will do a photoshoot and put a lady with a fixie. It&apos;s for no apparent reason \u2013 she&apos;ll be wearing some enormous dress that&apos;s impossible to cycle in, but she&apos;ll be holding a bike.&quot; Much of the boom is associated with road cycling, says Carlton Reid, who runs Bikebiz.com. &quot;Previously we had mountain bikes, but now they&apos;re dead in the water. No one can shift them out of their shops at the moment. It&apos;s all road bikes of \u00a3500-plus.&quot; Many buyers are middle class, middle-aged men investing in pricey carbon fibre machines, he says. &quot;It&apos;s such a clich\u00e9, but clich\u00e9s have got a basis in fact: cycling is the new golf.&quot; I don&apos;t even like saying the phrase but it&apos;s so true. You see the two sports portrayed on TV and you think: as an executive, which would you buy into?&quot; Chris Hoy, the six-time Olympic gold medallist, says cycling is a more inclusive sport than the cliche suggests. &quot;You don&apos;t have to spend \u00a310,000 on a bike. And once you&apos;ve got it, that&apos;s you. Compared to most sports, it&apos;s very accessible, very open. People from all backgrounds, of all abilities, of all shapes and sizes do it. It&apos;s a sport for all, it&apos;s certainly not a middle class sport,&quot; he says. Booms have happened before \u2013 bike sales surged in the UK and US after the 1973 oil crisis and, as now, there were attendant calls for proper cycling infrastructure on the roads. But within a couple of years the market crashed. This time there are established cycling &quot;tribes&quot;, Reid says: &quot;One part can fail and another will take over. It is this more resilient market now.&quot; It remains a notably male-dominated pursuit. Woman make little more than a quarter of all journeys by bike in the UK, and their representation in road cycling events is lower still. This is not because women don&apos;t want to cycle, according to Glynis Francis, who set up a south Manchester-based women&apos;s cycling club, Team Glow, in 2011. Instead, she says, many are put off by the sometimes macho and competitive atmosphere of male-dominated clubs: &quot;If I had a pound for every time a woman said &apos;I&apos;m a bit worried about holding everybody up&apos;, I&apos;d be a very wealthy woman. They come out and ride with us. They know we&apos;re not going to leave them in the middle of nowhere. We help people out with mechanicals and punctures. When woman are introduced to road cycling with all the right conditions, they fly.&quot; Francis, 59, who only took up serious cycling herself in her 40s and is now a British track racing champion for her age group, says the demand is there: her club began with seven paid members and now has more than 70. She says: &quot;We&apos;re not just out in frocks, going for cups of tea. We are the full spectrum of speeds. But we do it thoughtfully.&quot; Francis carried out an audit of women&apos;s cycling groups in the north-west for British Cycling \u2013 which she calls &quot;appalling&quot; at supporting women \u2013 and found 15 groups spanning 1,000 riders. The bike industry is viewed by many as similarly patronising to female riders, often producing a limited range of scaled-down bikes and accessories mainly distinguished by their colour palette \u2013 the so-called &quot;shrink it and pink it&quot; approach. Hussey recalls being urged not to bother making women&apos;s clothing when he launched Vulpine. When he did, the items sold out &quot;within days&quot; and he realised the error. &quot;I think there&apos;s actually more potential in women&apos;s cycling than there is in men&apos;s. Why on earth is women&apos;s cycling so badly catered for, across the board? Nobody really seems to have caught on to this.&quot; Francis is similarly scathing about retailers, recounting her experiences at the Evans store inside Manchester&apos;s National Cycling Centre, the base for the British Olympic team. &quot;They&apos;ve got the most pathetic collection of women&apos;s and bikes clothes in there,&quot; she says. British Cycling would point to its attempts to grow women&apos;s leisure cycling through a network of national Breeze clubs, which arrange informal all-female rides to introduce women to the sport, and its success in bringing elite female riders through the system. The gender divide at the top of the sport has become a huge issue in light of a campaign \u2013 led by the Ironman competitor Chrissie Wellington and British rider Emma Pooley among others \u2013 to reintroduce a women&apos;s Tour de France . A petition to the organisers of the men&apos;s race has reached more than 87,000 signatures. As for the London mayor, he said he merely hoped to complete the course, and did not expect a record-breaking time. &quot;The chiselled whippet is in there somewhere, but the sculptor has yet to find him. He may emerge in the course of the next few days,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;The strategy is just going to be to keep going at a reasonable pace, if I possibly can. It&apos;s not the length of time, it&apos;s the speed I&apos;m a bit worried about. I&apos;m not going to streak like a greased panther.&quot;", "sentences": ["I want people&apos;s mindset about cycling to be the same as you find in Amsterdam, or Berlin, or Copenhagen.", "Now we have what London is doing as a city in terms of commuters, trying to be like Amsterdam."], "title": "Cycling boom steps up a gear with RideLondon weekend", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/02/cycling-boom-ridelondon", "tags": ["Cycling", "Cycling", "Sport", "Fitness", "Life and style", "London", "Transport", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-03T05:00:00Z", "article": "Cutloose, Manchester A relatively recent addition to the new look of Amsterdam&apos;s red-light district, the limited stock of Redlight Records impetuously spans decades and genres as only that of an enthusiastically run record store would.

So, he undertook this role: acting, in\u00a0effect, as a state-licensed drug dealer;\u00a0and he also attempted a kind\u00a0of\u00a0psychotherapy, talking to me about\u00a0my problems and engaging with\u00a0my own restless critique of \u2013 among many other things \u2013 psychiatry itself. Together we conceived of doing some sort of project on drugs and addiction, and began undertaking research. On one memorable fact-finding trip to Amsterdam, we ended up smoking a\u00a0great deal of marijuana as\u00a0well as drinking to excess \u2013 I also scored heroin\u00a0and used it under the very eyes\u00a0of the medical practitioner who was, at least nominally, &quot;treating&quot;\u00a0me. All of this happened more than 20 years\u00a0ago, and I drag it up here not in order to retrospectively censure the psychiatrist concerned, but rather to present him and his behaviour as a perversely honest version of the role played by his profession. For what, in essence, do psychiatrists specialise in, if not mood-altering drugs? Or, to put it\u00a0another way, what do psychiatrists have to offer \u2013 over and above the other\u00a0so-called &quot;psy professions&quot; \u2013 beyond their capacity to legally administer psychoactive drugs, and in\u00a0some cases forcibly confine those they deem to be mentally ill? Psychiatry is undergoing one of its periodic convulsions at the moment \u2013 one that coincides with the publication by the American Psychiatric Association of the fifth edition of their\u00a0hugely influential &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM\u20135) \u2013 and I think we should all take the opportunity to join in the profession&apos;s own collective navel-gazing and existential angst. After all,\u00a0while the influence of the talking cures is pervasive in our society \u2013 running all the way up the scale from anodyne advice dispensed on daytime TV shows, to the wealthy shelling out hundreds of pounds a week to pet their\u00a0neuroses in the company of highly qualified black dog walkers \u2013 psychotherapy and psychoanalysis remain essentially voluntaristic undertakings; only psychiatry deals in\u00a0mandatory social care and legal sanction. Besides, only psychiatry partakes of the peculiar mystique that\u00a0attaches to medical care. We may dismiss the opinions of all sorts of counsellors and therapists, secure in\u00a0the knowledge that their very multifariousness is indicative of their lack of overall traction, but psychiatry, dealing, as it claims, with well-defined maladies \u2013 and treating them with drugs and hospitalisation \u2013 exerts an enormous pull on our collective self-image. Just what the nature of this pull is, and how it has come to condition our understanding of ourselves and our psychic functioning, is what I\u00a0wish\u00a0to unpick. Full-blown mental illness is an extremely frightening phenomenon to\u00a0observe \u2013 let alone experience. And much of the debate that surrounds the efficacy of contemporary psychiatry is warped by the knowledge \u2013 lurking in the wings of our minds \u2013 that we wish to have as little as possible to do with it. We may understand rationally that psychosis isn&apos;t a contagion, yet still we\u00a0turn aside from the street soliloquisers and avoid the tormented gazes of those being &quot;cared for in the community&quot;. Arguably, the response of those who treated a trip to Bedlam to view the\u00a0madmen and women as an\u00a0entertainment had the virtue of at\u00a0least being a form of contact. At their\u00a0peak, mental hospitals such as Bedlam (and formerly known as &quot;lunatic asylums&quot;) housed over 100,000 inmates, many of\u00a0whom had\u00a0been confined for behaviours that\u00a0today would be regarded as lifestyle choices, such as\u00a0socialism or\u00a0sexual promiscuity. The\u00a0hospitals were also dumping grounds for patients who we now know to have had organic brain diseases. It&apos;s sobering for those on the left to realise that the first politician to commit to their abolition was Enoch Powell. By\u00a0the early 1990s many long-stay inmates\u00a0had been returned to the\u00a0outside world, but their lives were\u00a0for the most part still grossly circumscribed: living in sheltered accommodation and visited by mental health teams, confined not by physical walls but by the chemical straitjackets of neuroleptic drugs.     An engraving of a bedridden patient at the New York City Lunatic Asylum Hospital in the late 1860s. Photograph: Stock Montage/Getty Images    Still, if you wish to visit Bedlam you can do so. The locked mental wards of\u00a0our hospitals present a terrifying spectacle of seriously disturbed patients shouting, yelping, gurning and shaking \u2013 I know, I&apos;ve seen them.\u00a0And it&apos;s the much-repressed knowledge that this is going on that helps, I would argue, to prevent too much criticism of the psychiatric profession. Just as we are quietly grateful to prison officers for banging up criminals, so too we are grateful for\u00a0psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses\u00a0for providing a cordon sanitaire between us and flamboyant insanity. Yet while the regime under which those diagnosed with mental pathologies has changed immensely in\u00a0the last half-century, the prognosis remains no better. Some say that it is manifestly worse, and that psychiatry itself is to blame. But the truth is that\u00a0hardly anyone \u2013 apart from the professionals, whose livelihoods depend on it \u2013 can either be bothered to wade through the reams of scientific papers concerned with the alternative treatment regimens, or understand the different methodologies arrived at to assess competing claims. Early in Our Necessary Shadow, his lucid, humane and in many ways well-balanced account of the nature and meaning of psychiatry, Tom Burns, professor of social psychiatry at Oxford University, makes a supremely telling remark: &quot;I am convinced psychiatry is a major force for good or I would not have spent my whole adult life in it.&quot; This is a form of the logical fallacy post\u00a0hoc ergo propter hoc (&quot;After this, therefore because of this&quot;), and it seems strange that an academic of such\u00a0standing should so blithely retail it because, of course, if we reverse the\u00a0statement it makes just as much sense: &quot;Having spent my whole adult life as a psychiatrist I must maintain the conviction that it is a major force for good.&quot; After all, the alternative \u2013 for\u00a0Burns and for thousands of other psychiatrists \u2013 is to accept that in fact their working lives have constituted something of a travesty: either locking up or drugging patients whose diseases are defined not by organic dysfunction but by socially unacceptable behaviours. Burns has the honesty and\u00a0integrity to admit that the major mental pathologies \u2013 schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression inter alia \u2013 cannot be defined in the same way as physical diseases, and he cleaves to the\u00a0currently fashionable view of psychiatry as seeking to understand mental maladies through the tripartite lens of the social, the psychological and the biological. He also states that he sees the role of\u00a0psychotherapy as central to the practise of psychiatry \u2013 and in this he dissents from the more mainstream &quot;biological&quot; model of treatment that has been in the ascendancy since the 1970s. But what Burns cannot quite bring himself to do is give up the drugs. In\u00a0a\u00a0333 page book (complete with a glossary, a bibliography and an index), there are just three references to the most commonly prescribed psychiatric drugs: the SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as Prozac and Seroxat). When he does consider the SSRIs, he notes that they may indeed be overprescribed (as of 2011 46.7m prescriptions had been written in the\u00a0UK for antidepressants), and in particular that they may be used to &quot;treat&quot; commonplace unhappiness rather than severe depression. What he doesn&apos;t venture near are the systematic critiques of antidepressants \u2013 and neuropharmacology in general \u2013 that have emerged in recent years. The work of Irving Kirsch, whose meta-analysis of SSRI double-blind trials revealed that in clinical terms \u2013 for a broad spectrum of depressed patients \u2013 SSRIs acted no better than a placebo, is something Burns doesn&apos;t want to look at. He also doesn&apos;t wish to examine too closely the\u00a0underlying &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; theory of depression on which the alleged efficacy of the SSRIs is based, presumably because he knows that it&apos;s essentially bunk: no fixed correlation has been established, despite intensive study, between levels of serotonin in the brain and depression.     Antidepressant tablets. Photograph: Jonathan Nourok/Getty Images    I&apos;ve swerved into consideration of antidepressants because I believe the exponential increase in their use is a function of the problem of legitimacy that psychiatry currently faces. Psychiatrists, of course, tell the public that the vast majority of these drugs are prescribed by general practitioners \u2013 not by them. But what has made it\u00a0possible for someone recently bereaved or unemployed to have a prescription written by their doctor to\u00a0alleviate their &quot;depression&quot;, is, I\u00a0would argue, very much to do with psychiatry&apos;s search for new worlds to conquer, an expedition that has been financed at every step by big pharma. Put bluntly: unable to effect anything like a cure in the severe mental pathologies, at an entirely unconscious and weirdly collective level psychiatry turned its attention to less marked psychic distress as a means of continuing to secure what sociologists term &quot;professional closure&quot;. After all, if chlorpromazine (commonly known as Largactil) and other neuroleptics don&apos;t cure schizophrenia \u2013 any more than lithium &quot;cures&quot; bipolar illness \u2013 then why exactly do you need a qualified medical doctor to dole them out? The proliferation of new psycho-pharmacological compounds has advanced in lock-step with the proliferation of new mental illnesses for them to &quot;treat&quot;. As Ian Hacking observes in a review of DSM\u20135 in the\u00a0current London Review of Books, the\u00a0first DSM \u2013 published in 1952 \u2013 and\u00a0its successor in 1968, were heavily influenced by the psychoanalytic theories then dominating psychiatry in\u00a0the US. In 1980, with DSM\u2013III there came a step-change. Hacking traces this to the efficacy of lithium in managing mania: &quot;Now there was something that worked \u2026 clear behavioural criteria were necessary to\u00a0identify who would benefit from lithium.&quot; James Davies begins his book, Cracked: Why Psychiatry Is Doing\u00a0More Harm Than Good, with\u00a0an\u00a0examination of how these behavioural criteria were arrived at by\u00a0the compilers of DSM\u2013III and its subsequent incarnations. You may be\u00a0thinking that all this is so much arcane knowledge \u2013 and wondering why we in Britain should be preoccupied by a diagnostic manual published in the US. But in fact the ICD (International Classification of Diseases) used by British doctors is compiled in the same way as the DSM \u2013 indeed most NHS psychiatrists favour the latter over the former. In the US it&apos;s simple: your insurance won&apos;t pay out unless you are diagnosed with a malady detailed in the\u00a0DSM, but in Britain we have a less tangible \u2013 but for all that pervasive \u2013 form of socio-medical discrimination: no sick note \u2013 and no social benefits \u2013 unless what ails you conforms to the paradigms set out in DSM. The focus of Davies&apos;s critique is that\u00a0the criteria for what constitutes ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), or autism, or indeed depression, are not arrived at by any\u00a0commonly understood scientific procedure, but rather by committee: psychiatrists getting together and pooling their understanding of how\u00a0patients with these maladies &quot;present&quot;\u00a0(in the jargon). Under these circumstances it becomes somewhat easier to understand how the tail can begin to wag the dog: rather than arriving at a commonly agreed set of symptoms that constitute a gestalt \u2013 and hence a malady \u2013 psychiatrists become influenced by what psycho-pharmacological compounds alleviate given symptoms, and so, as it were, &quot;create&quot; diseases to fit the drugs available. This in itself, Davies might argue, explains why there are more and\u00a0more new &quot;diseases&quot; with each edition of the DSM: it isn&apos;t a function of scientific acumen identifying hitherto hidden maladies, but of iatrogenesis: doctor-created disease. So, while it may well be general practitioners who do the doling out, psychiatrists are required to legitimate what they are doing and provide it with the sugar-coating of scientific authenticity. It&apos;s a dirty, well-paid and high-status job \u2013 but someone has to do it, no? The vast number of &quot;hyperactive&quot; children in the US prescribed Ritalin is so well attested to that it&apos;s become a trope in popular culture \u2013 just like the SSRI-munching depressive. But these are our version of low-level &quot;care in the community&quot;, the sad are becoming oddly co-morbid (afflicted with the same sorts of diseases) with the mad. Davies treads a familiar path in his critique of the influence of the multinational pharmaceutical companies on the structure and practice of psychiatry. If you aren&apos;t familiar with the fact that almost all drug trials are funded by those who stand to profit from their success then\u00a0\u2026 well, you jolly well should be. You should also be familiar with the extent to which university research departments and learned journals are funded by those who stand to profit \u2013 literally \u2013 from their presumed objectivity. The money generated by the SSRIs in particular is vast, easily enough to warp the dynamics and the ethics of\u00a0an entire profession, and indeed I\u00a0would agree with Davies that\u00a0it has in fact done just this. The\u00a0sections of his book that deal in particular with the way big pharma has\u00a0moved into markets outside the English-speaking world and effected a\u00a0wholesale cultural change in their perception of sadness (rebranding it, if\u00a0you will, as chemically treatable &quot;depression&quot;), simply in order to flog their dubious little blue pills, make for chilling reading. Actually, Burns would agree with some of this critique as well; and recall, he&apos;s a psychiatrist who fervently believes that his profession has been, and continues to be, a force for good. Davies is a psychologist, and to the outsider the fierceness of his attack might be dismissed as part of a turf war\u00a0among the psy professions (Irving Kirsch is a clinical psychologist as well). However, I don&apos;t think it helps anyone to see the current imbroglio as\u00a0simply a function of late capitalism in its most aggressive aspect. I&apos;m afraid\u00a0I have to mouth the old lily-livered liberal shibboleth at this point and observe that, yes, we are all to blame; and our responsibility is just as difficult for us to acknowledge because we are\u00a0largely unaware of it. We don&apos;t consciously collude in the chemical repression of the psychotic (and Davies\u00a0produces quite convincing statistics to support the view that those with psychosis actually recover better if they aren&apos;t medicated at all), any more than we consciously collude in the fiction of depression as a chemical imbalance that can be successfully treated with SSRIs. Instead, what both clinicians and\u00a0patients experience is quite the reverse: we feel absolutely bloody miserable, we can&apos;t get up in the morning, we are dirty and unkempt, and we go along to our GP and are prescribed an antidepressant, and lo and behold we recover. My GP, who has\u00a0just retired, and who is a wise and compassionate man who I absolutely trusted, told me that he prescribed SSRIs because they worked, and I\u00a0believed him. That they worked because of the overpoweringly efficacious curative power we believe doctors and their nostrums to possess rather than because of any real change in our brain chemistry was beside the point for him \u2013 and I suspect it&apos;s beside the point for the vast majority of patients as well. By the same token, Burns is at pains to stress, contra-DSM, that the great strength and skill of the practising psychiatrist lies in being able to intuit diagnoses by empathising with patients. Diagnosis, for Burns, is an art form \u2013 not a science. By his own account I&apos;ve little doubt that he&apos;s a good and effective psychiatrist who can make a real difference to the lives of those plagued by demons that undermine their sense of self. One of\u00a0my oldest friends is a consultant psychiatrist who I&apos;ve actually seen practising in just this way, with preternatural flair and compassion. In both their cases, however, I feel about them rather the way I do about the last archbishop of Canterbury: I\u00a0consider Rowan Williams to be a wise\u00a0and spiritual man mostly despite rather than because of his Christianity; and I think many psychiatrists are good healers mostly despite rather than because of the medical ideology of mental illness to which they subscribe. Interestingly there is one large sector of the &quot;mentally ill&quot; that Burns\u00a0believes are manifestly unsuitable for treatment \u2013 drug addicts\u00a0and alcoholics. He points to\u00a0the\u00a0ineffectiveness of almost all treatment regimens, possibly because the cosmic solecism of treating those addicted to psychoactive drugs with more psychoactive drugs hits home despite his well-padded professional armour. Elsewhere in Our Necessary Shadow he seems to embrace the idea that self-help groups of one kind or another could help to alleviate a great deal of mental illness, and it struck me as strange that he couldn&apos;t join the dots: after all, the one treatment that does have long-term efficacy for addictive illness is precisely this one. Psychiatrists are notoriously unwilling to endorse the 12-step programmes, and argue that statistically the results are not convincing. There may be some truth\u00a0in this \u2013 but there&apos;s also the inconvenient fact that there&apos;s no place for psychiatrists, or indeed any of the psy professionals, in autonomously organised self-help groups. Burns agrees with Davies that our reliance on psychiatry, and by extension, psycho-pharmacology, may well be related to our increasingly alienated state of mind in mass societies with weakened family ties, and often non-existent community ones. Surely self-help groups can play a large role in facilitating the rebirth of these nurturing and supportive networks? But Burns seems to feel that just as we\u00a0will always need a professional to come and mend the septic tank, so we\u00a0will always need a pro to sweep out\u00a0the Augean psychic stables. I&apos;m not\u00a0so sure; psychiatry has been bedevilled over the last two centuries\u00a0by &quot;treatments&quot; and &quot;cures&quot;\u00a0that have subsequently been revealed to be significantly harmful. From mesmerism, to lobotomy, to electroconvulsive therapy, to Valium and other benzodiazepines \u2013 the list of\u00a0these nostrums is long and ignoble, and I&apos;ve no doubt that the SSRIs will soon be added to their number. Sooner or later we will all have to\u00a0wake up, smell the snake oil, and realise that while medical science may\u00a0bring incalculable benefit to us, medical pseudo-science remains just as capable of advance. After all, one of\u00a0the drugs that Irving Kirsch&apos;s meta\u2011analysis of antidepressant trials\u00a0revealed as being just as efficacious as the SSRIs was \u2026 heroin.", "sentences": ["On one memorable fact-finding trip to Amsterdam, we ended up smoking a\u00a0great deal of marijuana as\u00a0well as drinking to excess \u2013 I also scored heroin\u00a0and used it under the very eyes\u00a0of the medical practitioner who was, at least nominally, &quot;treating&quot;\u00a0me."], "title": "Psychiatrists: the drug pushers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/03/will-self-psychiatrist-drug-medication", "tags": ["Mental health", "Health, mind and body", "Society", "Books", "Culture", "Health", "Society", "Drugs", "Drugs", "Science", "Psychiatry"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-03T23:05:00Z", "article": "In 2006, serial entrepreneur and investor Mart\u00edn Varsavsky \u2013 inspired by a conviction that he could cloak the world in free Wi-Fi by encouraging people to share their home connections \u2013 founded Fon in Madrid. The company is now the largest Wi-Fi network in the world, with almost 12m hot spots in more than 100 countries. &quot;My general thinking at the time was that we live in a world in which benefits are only accrued through economic growth and the endless consumption of resources, and that there have to be other ways that are of more benefit to people,&quot; he says. &quot;Why should everyone have their own car when most of the time they are not using them? Think of a marina full of boats. How frequently do those boats go out?&quot; Today, it has been argued that the sharing economy \u2013 which is perhaps best defined as a way of sweating underutilised assets, by building communities around them and turning consumers into providers \u2013 has the potential to reboot businesses across most economic categories. Indeed, Forbes magazine recently estimated that total revenues for the sector could top $3.5bn this year, with growth exceeding 25%. However, when setting up Fon, Varsavsky became convinced that people needed a nudge or financial incentive before they&apos;d happily share their assets. &quot;In the case of Wi-Fi we came up with the concept that if you share a little Wi-Fi at home, you can roam the world for free,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s a small loss and a huge gain. And now [years later] we see that in all those situations where you have a small loss and a big gain, the sharing economy makes sense.&quot; Yet while it makes sense, at least intellectually, it&apos;s when you start to examine the legalities around the ownership of assets that the sharing economy starts to run into trouble, argues the 53-year-old, who was born in Buenos Aires. It turns out ownership is not as clear cut as many of us might expect. &quot;You think something is yours to share until somebody says, &apos;Hey! It&apos;s not really yours at all,&apos;&quot; says Varsavsky, citing the terms and conditions around &quot;owning&quot; Wi-Fi and the copyright of books and music as examples. The fast-growing peer-to-peer (P2P) holiday lodgings market is another case in point. There are claims that its success is gnawing away at the incumbent hotel sector&apos;s profit margins and even starting to have an impact on property prices. The hotel industry has begun to fight back, primarily, it seems, through behind the scenes lobbying of regulators and politicians. On 20 May, New York officials ruled that a man who rented out part of his NYC apartment for three days on Airbnb \u2013 the sharing economy&apos;s most high-profile success story to date \u2013 should pay $2,400 for violating the city&apos;s illegal hotel law. Airbnb says it is committed to fighting the ruling. The P2P holiday rentals marketplace is hitting roadblocks in Europe, too: the authorities in Amsterdam and Berlin, for example, are reportedly considering laws that will make it tougher for companies such as Airbnb and its European rivals HouseTrip, Wimdu and 9flats to operate.     Mart\u00edn Varsavsky, CEO and founder of FON. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images    &quot;The sharing economy can create winners and losers, and property owners are winners and hotel owners are losers [in this case],&quot; says Varsavsky. &quot;Sometimes those who gain are atomised and gain little individually, while those who hurt, hurt a lot, and then organise very well. Those are the forces against sharing.&quot; The response of sharing economy companies encountering obstacles of this sort should be to rally the forces that stand to gain while making the case, wherever possible, that the forces of disruption can be good for &quot;traditional&quot; businesses too, he says. &quot;In the case of hotel stays versus apartment stays, there have been studies done that have shown there&apos;s a market that hotels don&apos;t address very well. And that is the market of families with children, for whom hotel stays can be very expensive. So Airbnb fills a niche of families who travel and their presence is actually accretive to the city. For example, the city of Paris studied this and concluded that Airbnb was a good thing, because it&apos;s bringing even more people to Paris overall, and the economy was doing better, while hotels were not really getting hurt.&quot; Similarly, when Varsavsky launched Fon, it ran into determined opposition from telecoms businesses, which said that the company&apos;s vision of shared Wi-Fi was against their terms of service. &quot;What we showed with Fon was that you would only share with those who share back,&quot; he says. &quot;We actually created a new incentive for people to sign up for DSL or broadband connections, which was to sign up at home, to roam the world. This became so true that T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and BT all became shareholders in Fon.&quot; Sharing economy companies who fail to convince the established players that they add value are likely to become unstuck, adds Varavsky. &quot;With [P2P file-sharing services] Napster and Kazaa, when people started sharing songs in a way where there was no value for the record labels or copyright holders, they fought them like crazy and closed them down. The sharing of music had to come up with a concept more like Spotify, which makes use of the same P2P technology that Kazaa used to use, but it left money aside to pay the record labels \u2013 so the model became legal and now it&apos;s a success.&quot; When asked where he thinks the sharing economy will go next, Varsavsky picks an unexpected area: fertility. &quot;For a long time fertility has been helped by people who have been sharing their sperm or eggs, in order to make reproduction possible for others. But it&apos;s been done in a very restrictive way so far. I think, as the average age of people having children goes up, fertility is an area which will see a great deal of change, because of the ability to obtain embryos, eggs, sperm, surrogacy \u2013 all of those are examples of people doing something for someone else. People don&apos;t think of fertility as part of the sharing economy, but I do. Life must come from life.&quot; Another area set to boom, he predicts, is the sharing of expensive equipment for gardening, DIY and even farming. &quot;These are all things that are bought, used extremely little and are likely to be shared. Social platforms will play a big role in this and open up all these categories, because people can just say, &apos;I need this&apos; and there&apos;s an instant audience. All these [sharing economy] sites have log-ins with Facebook, Twitter and Google+, which removes the friction, enabling us to make more rational use of our assets [like these]. That&apos;s one of the reasons why the sharing economy is here to stay.&quot; Work     Leah Busque and Kobe, the dog that inspired her to found TaskRabbit. Photograph: TaskRabbit    Leah Busque is the founder and CEO of TaskRabbit.com, an online and mobile peer-to-peer marketplace for neighbourhood errands and small jobs One blustery Boston night in February 2008, Leah Busque and her husband were about to go out for dinner when they realised they&apos;d run out of dog food and didn&apos;t have time to get any. Later that night the conversation turned to a business idea: an online marketplace where people could outsource little jobs (such as running to the corner shop) by connecting with others nearby. Fast-forward four months and Busque had quit her job as a software engineer at IBM to launch TaskRabbit. Although leaving a well-paid job amid mounting economic turbulence worried her, the very nature of her plan \u2013 to create a marketplace for freelancers (known as TaskRabbits) \u2013 just as people were being laid off in droves, simultaneously vindicated it. &quot;I had doctors, lawyers and pharmacists coming to me to be TaskRabbits so they could float themselves between jobs,&quot; she recalls. Later this year (&quot;early in Q4&quot; is as precise as Busque will get), TaskRabbit opens in London \u2013 the first outpost beyond the US in a planned global rollout. With headquarters in San Francisco, the company has received funding totalling $37.7m to date, and now has over 13,000 background-checked TaskRabbits in 14 US cities. But progress hasn&apos;t been plain sailing. Last month Busque, 33, confirmed the company had laid off an unspecified number of staff. &quot;We needed to reorganise the team to support further investment in some key areas around mobile, geographic expansion and the business customer,&quot; she says. The last area \u2013 TaskRabbit for Business \u2013 has proven to be a sweet spot; small businesses seeking vetted, temporary staff, particularly in events, office administration and customer service now account for 30% of monthly revenues. It&apos;s an innovation Busque claims could eventually displace big recruitment agencies. &quot;[We] are a much lighter-weight model that&apos;s easier for a small business to utilise and much cheaper. We only take a 20% cut of every transaction, whereas a lot of the staffing industry can take far more.&quot; For tax purposes Task Rabbits are considered independent contractors responsible for their own tax returns, but how a fee, say for assembling Ikea furniture (one of the site&apos;s popular tasks), relates to minimum wage legislation is so far untested. Busque&apos;s vision is to revolutionise the way we work. &quot;By providing people with the tools and resources to set their own schedules, be their own bosses and say how much they want to get paid is incredibly empowering. It has huge implications for the global labour force.&quot; Transportation     Nicolas Brusson, co-founder of BlaBlaCar.com Photograph: Blablacar.com    Nicolas Brusson is co-founder of BlaBlaCar.com If Airbnb is the American-born poster child of the new trust economy then BlaBlaCar is fast becoming Europe&apos;s riposte. Founded in 2004 and now in 10 countries (including the UK, where it launched 2011), the Paris-based ride-sharing service, which handles 600,000 passengers a month, is on track to pip Eurostar&apos;s 900,000 by the end of the year. With 3\u00a0million Europeans registered as members, the company is that rarest of breeds \u2013 a tech startup that solves a genuine problem. &quot;What we do is connect cities by creating a new transport network based on empty seats in cars,&quot; says co-founder Nicolas Brusson. Drivers post on the website that they have, for example, three empty seats for their journey from London to Manchester on Friday evening. They set a fee of \u00a315-\u00a320. Passengers get in touch, and pay in the car or via the BlaBlaCar site. &quot;The reason it&apos;s taking off right now is the macroeconomic factors around us. Petrol prices going up, the cost of owning a car has gone up dramatically all over Europe \u2013 especially in the UK, when you include petrol, insurance, depreciation, MOT, tax and so on \u2013 at a time when disposable income hasn&apos;t. &quot;On the driver side, we have an equation where the problem isn&apos;t buying a car any more, it&apos;s owning one \u2013 and that&apos;s helping us to convince drivers to share their ride. On the other side, you see the same dynamic. Train prices, especially, have gone up dramatically in past five to 10 years. If you want to book a train from London to Manchester for Friday evening, you&apos;re going to pay \u00a350-\u00a370 one way, when BlaBlaCar is going to cost you \u00a315. So we offer a last-minute, flexible, super-low-cost transport network.&quot; BlaBlaCar, which received $10m in a venture round led by Accel Partners in January 2012, is free at first, allowing users to discover the service, be introduced to one another online and pay in person, thereby building up a level of familiarity and trust, says Brusson. &quot;Then, as soon as we have enough people in the service, we introduce an online booking service, where essentially the passenger will pay online and we manage not only the interaction but also the transaction. The company holds on to the money, until the driver and passenger ride together and rate each other. Once we have the feedback that it worked, we transfer the money to the driver and take a commission fee.&quot; For tax and insurance reasons, drivers aren&apos;t allowed to make a profit on the journey, merely to cover costs. Through feedback (BlaBlaCar has, for example, accumulated 2.3m ratings between members), social media and online data trails, including member profiles, mobile numbers, credit card and bank details, a layer of transparency is created. &quot;We have a complete track of who\u00a0travelled where with whom and when,&quot; says Brusson. &quot;In terms of trust and safety, which is always a debate in sharing economy, that&apos;s very powerful.&quot;", "sentences": ["The P2P holiday rentals marketplace is hitting roadblocks in Europe, too: the authorities in Amsterdam and Berlin, for example, are reportedly considering laws that will make it tougher for companies such as Airbnb and its European rivals HouseTrip, Wimdu and 9flats to operate."], "title": "The sharing economy: a whole new way of living", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/04/internet-technology-fon-taskrabbit-blablacar", "tags": ["Internet", "Entrepreneurs", "Small business", "Economics", "Technology", "Society", "Business", "Online shopping", "Money", "Wifi"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-05T12:57:41Z", "article": "Exactly what danger is posed to US, British and French interests in Yemen is not public knowledge. But it comes as no surprise that the poorest country in the Arab world and the home of al-Qaida&apos;s most active local &quot;franchise&quot; is the apparent focus of the\u00a0international terrorist alert that has\u00a0led\u00a0to the closure of western embassies across the Middle East. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) emerged in Yemen in 2007 after\u00a0the organisation&apos;s effective defeat\u00a0in neighbouring Saudi Arabia. It\u00a0is the regular target of US drone strikes. Little is known about the links between it and al-Qaida central in Pakistan. But it is sustained by local factors including wild terrain, economic misery, tribal divisions and the weakness of the Yemeni state, battered by the Arab spring and the threat from secessionist movements. AQAP is led by Nasser al-Wahayshi, a charismatic Yemeni jihadist who has created &quot;a unified and cohesive militant organisation that has been involved not only in several transnational terrorist attacks but also in fighting an insurgency that has succeeded in capturing and controlling large areas of territory&quot;, according to Stratfor, an international\u00a0security consultancy. In recent weeks Wahayshi, 36, has reportedly been appointed to a senior al-Qaida position by Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden&apos;s Egyptian successor. Wahayshi, who was Bin Laden&apos;s private secretary in Afghanistan, fled to Iran in 2001 and was extradited to Yemen in 2003. In 2006 he escaped from a prison in Sana&apos;a in a mass breakout that did much to invigorate the country&apos;s violent extremists. The group has been under heavy pressure over the past 18 months. Its fighters have been pushed back to desert hideouts from much of the territory they captured in southern Yemen. Despite these setbacks, they have continued publishing an English\u2011language online magazine called Inspire, a magnet for jihadists from Pakistan to Mali. AQAP is monitored by Saudi intelligence as well as the CIA and MI6, which both have liaison officers in Sana&apos;a and Riyadh. The Nigerian underwear bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit in 2009, was radicalised in Yemen while claiming to be there studying Arabic. Earlier that year the group tried to assassinate the Saudi security chief, Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, with a bomb concealed on the attacker&apos;s body. AQAP regularly attacks Yemeni security and intelligence officers, with more than 60 killed in the past two years, according to the country&apos;s interior\u00a0ministry. It was revealed in February that the CIA was secretly using an airbase in Saudi Arabia to conduct its drone assassination campaign in Yemen. Diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks had earlier exposed the scale of US covert\u00a0involvement. Last week the Yemeni president, Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, met Barack Obama in Washington. The two leaders &quot;reaffirmed their commitment to a\u00a0strong counter-terrorism partnership, discussing a range of efforts to counter the threat to both countries posed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula&quot;, the\u00a0White House said.

And why would Britain abandon it? It has monkeys. It has rock&apos;n&apos;roll history. It has rock&apos;n&apos;roll history that collides with monkeys. Here are some of the things you might not know about Gibraltar. 1. Gibraltar, like many a British town centre, has a Marks &amp; Spencer and a Bhs. There are branches of Next, Mothercare and Wallis. The Morrisons branch is said to be one of the busiest and most successful of all the supermarket&apos;s stores, and attracts daytripping expats from nearby Spain. Living the dream indeed. 2. When asked, at the referendum in 2002, whether Spain and the UK should share sovereignty of Gibraltar, more than 98% of Gibraltarians said it should remain British. 3. Gibraltar may have been the place where the Neanderthals died out. A study published in Nature in 2006 suggested they were living in a cave site on the south-east of Gibraltar up to 24,000 years ago (later than the 30,000 years previously thought). However, new carbon dating may be about to force archaeologists to rethink that.     Jason Biggs: had a run-in with a monkey while on holiday in Gibraltar.    4. There are thought to be about 230 Barbary macaques on the rock, the only wild population of the monkeys in Europe. Last year, more than 50 people were treated in hospital following attacks. In a bizarre incident involving one of their most high-profile victims, the American Pie actor Jason Biggs and his wife were attacked while on holiday. The monkeys set on the pair, after she apparently teased one with a tampon from her handbag. &quot;The one monkey opened the tampon, put the tampon in his mouth like he was smoking a cigar,&quot; recalled Biggs last year. It is unclear whether this is the same incident, differently told, of another report that Biggs was attacked in 2009. If he was, we can glean two facts: he really must love Gibraltar if he wanted to revisit it, and Gibraltar&apos;s monkeys must really have a thing against him. I understand, I&apos;ve seen American Reunion. 5. Brian Jones also had a run-in with the monkeys. In 1967, the Rolling Stones&apos; guitarist, accompanied by Anita Pallenberg and Marianne Faithfull \u2013 all on LSD \u2013 visited the colony in Gibraltar en route to meet the rest of the band in Morocco. According to Faithfull&apos;s autobiography, Jones decided he wanted to play a tape of music he had made for a film starring Pallenberg to the monkeys. &quot;We approached the troop of monkeys very ceremoniously,&quot; she writes, &quot;and told them we were going to play them some wonderful sounds. They listened to all this very attentively, but when Brian turned on the tape recorder, they didn&apos;t seem to care for it. They seemed alarmed by it and scampered away shrieking. Brian got very upset. He took it personally. He became hysterical and started sobbing.&quot; 6. It isn&apos;t exactly a paradise of open space. Most of the 30,000 population of this 2.6 square mile peninsula live in flats, crammed on land at the base of the rock. Property prices are high \u2013 fuelled by the strong economy, and attractiveness to tax exiles \u2013 and many young Gibraltarians are being forced to move to Spain and commute to Gibraltar, a journey that can take hours if there are delays at the crossing.

It&apos;s often described as being a bit like Britain in a time warp, and not all of it cosy and nostalgic. The age of consent for gay men was only equalised in 2011, civil partnerships are not recognised, let alone equal marriage, and gay couples have only been allowed to adopt since April this year following a supreme court ruling. 8. In March 1969, John Lennon and Yoko Ono flew to Gibraltar, where they were married in a 10-minute ceremony at the British consulate by registrar Cecil Wheeler. It was the only place that could marry them at such short notice. Within an hour they headed for Amsterdam, and the Hilton hotel, where they spent their honeymoon in bed, accompanied by the world&apos;s press, to call for world peace. Gibraltar, which commemorated 30 years since the marriage with a special edition of stamps in 1999, doesn&apos;t appear to have taken it as a snub. 9. Around 12% of the workforce is employed by Gibraltar&apos;s big online gaming industry. Attracted by low taxes, several of the biggest names in online gambling have moved offshore to Gibraltar in recent years, including William Hill and Ladbrokes. 10. Gibraltar&apos;s chief minister Fabian Picardo has made it his recent mission to attract hedge fund managers to move from Britain, saying they may only be liable for around \u00a330,000 in income tax, regardless of how much they earn (there is also no inheritance tax, no VAT, no capital gains tax and low income and corporation tax).

The global beverage giant, which booked $48bn in revenues in 2012, talks about how water is &quot;a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing unprecedented challenges from over exploitation, increasing pollution, poor management and climate change.&quot; Coca-Cola says that its plastic bottles could be subject to &quot;deposits or certain eco taxes or fees.&quot; And the company worries that growing concern about &quot;the potential health problems associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a significant challenge to our industry.&quot; PepsiCo also acknowledges the problem of water scarcity in its Form 10-K. But the company doesn&apos;t cite the potential regulation of plastic bottles as a concern. And the word &quot;obesity&quot;does not appear anywhere in its annual filing. What&apos;s going on here? It&apos;s possible that Coca-Cola is more aware of social and environmental risks than is its arch rival. More likely, the Coke and Pepsi lawyers don&apos;t agree on what constitutes a &quot;material&quot; risk to their business, and thus has to be reported. If nothing else, the different Form 10-Ks are evidence that the quality of sustainability disclosure varies widely - even though public companies are legally obligated to tell the SEC and investors about the social, political and environmental risks they face. Consistency in sustainability reporting The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), a non-profit group based in San Francisco, has set out to bring some consistency to sustainability reporting. Working closely with corporations, investors and other stakeholders, SASB is developing sector-specific sustainability accounting standards for US public companies. Last week, SASB (it&apos;s pronounced sazz-bee) released its first set of provisional standards, covering the health care sector - hospital, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, among others. Other sectors will follow soon. Of course, SASB and its backers have more in mind that just improving disclosure. If all goes according to plan, the improved transparency will alert investors to a variety of non-financial risks, ranging from unethical drug marketing to &quot;unburnable carbon.&quot; Then, as investors awaken, they will insist on changes in corporate behavior. So, at least, goes the theory.  But none of that will happen until disclosure improves markedly, says Jean Rogers, the founder and executive director of SASB. She says: &quot;The law is clear that material information has to be disclosed. What&apos;s missing is the accounting infrastructure. &quot;Our model is that you type in a ticker symbol, and you get sustainability fundamentals alongside the financial fundamentals.&quot;  SASB is by no means alone in trying to bring sustainability performance to light. The Global Reporting Initiative, founded in 1997 and based in Amsterdam, has developed a series of sustainability reporting frameworks that are used by more than 5,500 companies and nonprofits.The International Integrated Reporting Council, which was launched in 2009 with the support of the Prince of Wales, is working towards &quot;a consistent, collaborative and internationally accepted approach to integrated reporting,&quot; which incorporates financial reporting along with environmental, social and governance reporting. Meanwhile, the UN-backed Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative seeks to promote transparency around environmental, social and government issues. Framework mania &quot;It&apos;s framework mania,&quot; observes Cary Krosinsky, an author and executive officer of the Network for Sustainable Financial Markets. Transparency is important, he notes, &quot;but there&apos;s a big difference between awareness and action.&quot;  To succeed, organisations like SASB, GRI and IIRC will have to persuade mainstream investors to pay more attention to corporate sustainability performance. That&apos;s no easy task. Short-term investors, in particular, don&apos;t worry about how water shortages may or may not constrain Coke or Pepsi years from now. And so-called socially responsible investment vehicles, which for decades have touted themselves as &quot;greener&quot; or more humane than conventional investments, remain niche players in the capital markets.  For its part, SASB is clearly aiming at the mainstream. The working group that developed its provisional health-care standards included publicly traded companies with more than $800bn in market value and investment firms with more than $952bn in assets under management, the group says.  The issues they identified as likely to be material for the health-care sector include energy and water management, pharmaceutical water contamination, drug safety and side effects, ethical marketing, affordability and fair pricing, managed care price performance and safety of clinical trial participants.  SASB will next unveil standards for the financial sector, and examinations of the technology and communications sector (hardware, software and the internet) and non-renewables (oil, gas, mining and metals) are well underway.  &quot;We address environmental, social and governance factors that have the potential to affect the company&apos;s long-term value creation,&quot; Rogers says.&quot;The standards end up being quite tailored to the industry.&quot;  All of this is done with an eye to meeting the SEC definition of &quot;materiality,&quot; which is both long-established and unavoidably vague; it&apos;s essentially designed to reveal data that would be relevant to a reasonable investor. &quot;We are unabashedly focused on the capital markets,&quot; Rogers says. SASB&apos;s funders include the Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Generation Foundation. Will expectations be set too low? Of course, the fact that SASB is working closely with big companies and mainstream investors carries risks as well as benefits. One fear is that expectations will be set too low, and that incremental, but inconsequential, change will be deemed sufficient. &quot;The SASB standard is moving the ball forward in promising ways,&quot; says Bill Baue, an advisor to SASB and co-founder with Mark McElroy of the Sustainability Context Group. But, he adds: &quot;My biggest critique of the ESG or the SRI movements is they don&apos;t have a norm or a goal baked into their process. As long as we&apos;re headed generally in he right direction, we&apos;re OK.&quot;  Baue argues that corporate performance should be evaluated in the context of its impact on limited, natural capital resources. So, for example, if scientists say that the world needs to slash carbon emissions dramatically by 2050, each company needs to be required to do its part.  That&apos;s a lot of ask, of course, but minor modifications to business-as-usual won&apos;t get us where we need to go.", "sentences": ["The Global Reporting Initiative, founded in 1997 and based in Amsterdam, has developed a series of sustainability reporting frameworks that are used by more than 5,500 companies and nonprofits.The International Integrated Reporting Council, which was launched in 2009 with the support of the Prince of Wales, is working towards &quot;a consistent, collaborative and internationally accepted approach to integrated reporting,&quot; which incorporates financial reporting along with environmental, social and governance reporting."], "title": "Will sustainability reporting standards change the way business does business?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/sustainability-reporting-standards-change-business", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability reporting"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-07T10:02:16Z", "article": "The proposals to expand the UK&apos;s airports have prompted plenty of debate around efficiency, expense, and timescale but one thing is indisputable: they effect thousands of homes. Heathrow airport&apos;s plan for a third runway \u2013 set out in three options, each permitting 260,000 more flights annually and involving the loss of 850 to 2,700 homes \u2013 is just one submission to the government-appointed Airports Commission, headed by former Financial Services Authority chairman Howard Davies. Other options include the expansion of Stansted and Gatwick airports, and building the new so-called Boris Island airport at Shivering Sands in the Thames Estuary. Whatever the pros and cons of each, the uncertainty created by possible development is hitting property values and sale prospects. &quot;If you were thinking of buying within or near one of the possible London airport proposals, you&apos;d step back and think again,&quot; says James Del Mar of estate agency Knight Frank, who heads the firm&apos;s team advising on compensation for homes along the route of the HS2 high-speed train service from London to Birmingham. &quot;An airport proposal is probably far more damaging than a railway line. The latter is narrow, and affects a relatively small number of homes along an extended route. But an airport expansion could effect thousands of homes in a very small area,&quot; he says. The problem for owners near possible expansion sites is the long wait for a decision. By Christmas the Airports Commission will suggest ways of improving existing capacity, but its deadline for options for any new runway or airport is mid-2015. Even then the government of the day is not obliged to consider its findings, or definitively rule in or out any proposal. &quot;Until the decision, all homes which are vulnerable are effectively blighted,&quot; says Del Mar. Owners cannot claim compensation from a public body, through the serving of a Statutory Blight Notice, until a proposal is safeguarded \u2013 the official description of a major development proposal once it has secured planning consent. That is likely to be many years away, even if the government makes a firm decision in 2015. Between 2005 and 2010 Heathrow&apos;s then-owner, BAA, bought hundreds of homes around the airport under its voluntary Property Market Support Bond scheme. It purchased homes at values which were index-linked from a 2002 base \u2013 that year was chosen as it marked the start of the blight period caused by speculation about airport expansion. The scheme was scrapped in 2010 when the new coalition government immediately ruled out Heathrow expansion, a commitment on which it has now reneged. BAA&apos;s successor company, Heathrow Airport Holdings, says there is no plan to reintroduce a bond scheme. That leaves homeowners near Heathrow \u2013 and their counterparts in Stansted, Gatwick and the Thames Estuary \u2013 in limbo for years to come, and the effect can be devastating. Jacky Clark-Basten lives above her hairdressing business in Sipson, a village in Hillingdon, which has suffered for the past decade from Heathrow expansion plans. Because she has a business address she was excluded from the bond compensation scheme, which saw 247 of the 548 properties in the village snapped up by BAA. &quot;We struggle on and some of the BAA properties are now rented out so there&apos;s a community of sorts. But our homes are blighted and the uncertainty and diminishing population risks ruining the local businesses,&quot; she says. &quot;There aren&apos;t many individually owned homes left. A few try to sell and some get close to a market value, but others try and no one&apos;s interested. It&apos;s completely hit and miss. Now the latest Heathrow suggestion adds years more uncertainty and blight,&quot; she says. Sipson largely escapes the sound of Heathrow&apos;s average 1,300 landings and departures each day, unlike some of those directly under the flight path. However, they are not necessarily the worst hit by the prospect of extra flights. Simon Barnes, a London property consultant running a house-finding service for wealthy clients, says: &quot;Some of the capital&apos;s most expensive houses are under the direct Heathrow flight path, most notably\u00a0Kensington Palace\u00a0Gardens.\u00a0I&apos;ve never heard anyone arguing about noise levels nor have prices ever been negatively impacted.&quot; But in other parts of the country where the housing market is weaker \u2013 such as near Luton airport, which is seeking to extend overnight flights \u2013 locals cite international examples to bolster their case that prices are damaged. In the US in 2007 Pennsylvania State University research showed prices fell by 10% to 12% because of noise. In 2009 research by academics in Amsterdam suggested values near airports fell by around \u20ac1,450 per decibel of noise from approaching or departing aircraft. In 2012 a study commissioned about airport expansion in Frankfurt produced results showing price falls of 14% for homes most severely affected by noise. The biggest nightmare, though, remains blight, and not just for those whose homes may one day be demolished. Those living close to, but not within, a development zone are hit too. &quot;Under legislation those living immediately outside the development area but whose house values are damaged cannot begin any process for possible compensation until one year after the project has been completed&quot; says Knight Frank&apos;s James Del Mar. In the meantime, they have noise, disruption and little chance of moving home.", "sentences": ["In 2009 research by academics in Amsterdam suggested values near airports fell by around \u20ac1,450 per decibel of noise from approaching or departing aircraft."], "title": "Airport expansion uncertainty blights property values", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/aug/07/homeowners-airport-expansion-heathrow-gatwick-stansted", "tags": ["Property", "House prices", "Consumer affairs", "Family finances", "Money", "Airline industry", "Housing market", "Business", "Heathrow third runway", "Environment", "UK news", "Society", "London", "Heathrow airport", "Stansted airport", "Gatwick airport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-08T02:41:00Z", "article": "Melbourne city council recently did something astonishing \u2013 at least to those unfamiliar with cities such as Copenhagen or Amsterdam. It removed a vehicle lane as part of a trial to make more room for cyclists on Princes Bridge.  It&apos;s the latest sign that Melbourne is starting to live up to the lord mayor&apos;s pledge of being &quot;a true cycling city&quot;. A four-year plan aims to increase the number of cyclists by 50%, while in the past two years $8m has been invested in cycle paths and the launch of a bike hire scheme (which has admittedly come with a few helmet-related issues).  While the Victorian government still appears to think that transport strategy should be about moving cars around, rather than people, Melbourne has undergone a cycling surge.  I&apos;ve cycled in the city for five years and noticed a gradual shift from Lycra-clad powerhouses to skinny jean-wearing fixie riders. The city&apos;s cycling culture embraces vintage bikes, wicker baskets and meet-ups that, being Melbourne, crowbar coffee into proceedings.  Fortunately, there&apos;s plenty to attract riders without sculpted facial hair \u2013 the cycling trails along the Yarra are a meandering joy for all, with the diverse Capital City Trail taking in everything from the Docklands to the Collingwood Children&apos;s Farm.  Of course, it&apos;s not perfect. Bike lanes are still fragmented, I&apos;ve been sent tumbling painfully down a hill in St Kilda because a driver happily opened a car door without looking, and people waiting for trams on Swanston Street now have to share their space with cyclists.  Despite this, Melbourne might just be Australia&apos;s best cycling city. But what of the other contenders? Sydney If Sydney&apos;s vertiginous hills are off-putting to potential cyclists, the figures don&apos;t show it. The Australian Bicycle Council last month released figures showing that 19% of Sydney residents jump on a bike at least once a week \u2013 double the national average and a huge increase on 4% in 2011.  Saskia Howard, the founder of Sydney Cycle Chic, says: &quot;When I started the blog three years ago, it was at the start of the wave and usage has increased hugely since then. It&apos;s become normal to cycle.&quot; Sydney&apos;s lord mayor, Clover Moore, has been supportive of grassroots ventures, according to Howard. &quot;There&apos;s the Bike Film Festival and network community bike groups. It&apos;s really been a nice couple of years.&quot;     A cyclist in a bike lane on Elizabeth Street in central Sydney. Nineteen per cent of Sydneysiders jump on a bike at least once a week. Photograph: Christopher Samuel/AAP    But what about those hills? &quot;Doesn&apos;t really matter,&quot; Howard says. &quot;There&apos;s lots of cycling in San Francisco and it&apos;s bloody hilly there.&quot; Hobart A verdant, compact city, Hobart lends itself well to non-car transport \u2013 it has the highest proportion of people walking to work among the capitals, although also the second lowest rate of people cycling to work.  There are pleasant stretches of cycle path, including a route along an old railway track in the northern suburbs, and a scenic 10km lane that hugs the waterfront. &quot;Hobart is a pretty city with some high-quality bike paths,&quot; says Mary McParland, executive officer of Cycling South. &quot;Tourists are happy to ride out to Mona and some of the best paths are completely separated from roads.&quot; But there is work to be done: &quot;If you don&apos;t live near the bike routes things aren&apos;t so great. Plus there are the hills, but that&apos;s where electric bikes come in, I suppose.&quot; Brisbane Paul French from Brisbane&apos;s Bicycle User Group doesn&apos;t pull any punches when it comes to the city&apos;s progress on cycling. &quot;Words that spring to mind include hopeless, woeful, inadequate,&quot; he says. &quot;You can go through the thesaurus on that one, really.&quot; There is a south-east Queensland cycle network plan but French says it is moving at a &quot;snail&apos;s pace&quot; and has so far failed to deliver the promised 600km of bike paths.     Public bicycles for hire in Brisbane. Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP    A 2011 goal to double cycling by 2016 has &quot;simply stagnated&quot;, says French, while the pathway infrastructure put in place is prone to flooding. &quot;Brisbane is one of most car-dependent places on Earth \u2013 with only 2% of the transport budget going on footpaths and cycling,&quot; he says. As well as a strategy to make cycling a default mode of transport, French wants side slush guards fitted to trucks to prevent cyclist deaths.  On the plus side, Brisbane has some great rides to be tackled beside the river, there&apos;s a bike hire scheme and the climate is conducive to year-round cycling. Canberra As a relatively new city surrounded by nature, Canberra has forged a largely harmonious relationship with its cyclists. &quot;There&apos;s a fantastic amount of infrastructure for the everyday commuter \u2013 you can be on a country road in 10 minutes and there are a couple of great cycling and community groups,&quot; says Nathan Edmondson, secretary of the Canberra Cycling Club. &quot;People might not like the weather here, but I think it&apos;s perfect cycling weather.&quot; The challenge for the city, like many others, is to ensure that bike paths keep pace with growth. &quot;The on-road path option can suddenly run out, leaving you right next to a truck, which is the same for other cities,&quot; Edmondson says. &quot;There&apos;s continual improvement that needs to be done, but I think the ACT government does a lot compared to others.&quot; Does Edmondson have to continually dodge frantically pedalling politicians? &quot;Not really. They have a habit of getting into a car to go three metres. The only time I see one on a bike is when Tony Abbott spots a camera.&quot; Perth Perth is the third windiest city in the world. Wobbly cyclists beware. But for those not fussed by a stiff breeze, Perth is an agreeable place for cycling \u2013 it has long stretches of coastline and a flat landscape with hilly rides out of town if the mood takes you.     Cycling over the Narrows Bridge in Perth. The city has long stretches of coastline and a flat landscape. Photograph: Nicola Wells/Lonely Planet Images    The WA government has committed an extra $10m to upgrading key routes, such as the Perth-to-Fremantle path that varies wildly in quality. There&apos;s also Cycle Instead Bikeweek to get people saddled up. &quot;Car is still king here \u2013 I personally don&apos;t have issues with angsty drivers but I know others do,&quot; says Jeremey Murray, chief executive of Bicycling WA.  &quot;The number of people cycling to work is growing all the time. I rode to work today and I stopped at a set of lights and there were bikes spilling out of the lane. It showed that we are getting there.&quot; Adelaide The pros may have the Tour Down Under but Adelaide offers plenty to the less lithe among the cycling fraternity. The city has copious bicycle lanes, a pleasant climate, nearby hills and is pancake flat. It&apos;s also getting a bit of Melbourne-style bike culture.     Riders prepare for the start of the final stage of the Tour Down Under in Adelaide. Photograph: David Mariuz/AAP    &quot;We&apos;re seeing people expand the types of bikes they ride, from just road bikes to mountain bikes and fixies,&quot; says Christian Haag, chief executive of Bike SA.  &quot;The cycling community is growing every year. We&apos;re seeing young urban males and female choosing bikes that say something about their lives.&quot; This culture is boosted by a free bike hire scheme that is operated by local businesses, rather than fixed kiosks. Tourists can therefore get helpful tips from a human, as well as a bike, helmet and chain. Darwin If you don&apos;t mind torrential rain, Darwin is a perfect year-round cycling destination. The balmy temperatures help, as does the flat terrain and the 70km of cycle lanes that weave throughout the Northern Territory&apos;s capital.  &quot;I&apos;d say as much as 80% of the population of Darwin cycles for commuting or for fun \u2013 it&apos;s huge up here,&quot; says Paul Bennett, founder of Spokes NT.  &quot;There&apos;s a young population in Darwin that likes cycling and it&apos;s very popular with women in particular. While the rest of the country is freezing, it&apos;s 28 or 29 degrees here without a cloud in the sky.&quot; Bennett says there are seven cycle shops in the city and they are all &quot;flat out&quot; with work, mainly on mountain bikes. Fixies haven&apos;t caught on with Territorians as yet, it seems. For my money, Melbourne and Adelaide are vying to be Australia&apos;s top cycling city, with Sydney and Darwin making late surges for the title. But what do you think?

He finished half a point ahead of the former world champion and current No3, Vlad Kramnik, who has made Germany&apos;s premier event his special\u00a0patch. &quot;I did not expect such a result,&quot; he said. &quot;I prepared carefully for every game and tried to do my best. That everything went so well makes me very happy.&quot; The England No1 dominated in his wins and he only once had an inferior position, when he was under pressure from Wang Hao before China&apos;s top player chose the wrong plan and blundered to defeat. In the final round Kramnik had to win, so chose the combative Sicilian, but Adams&apos;s shrewd reply 2 c3 quickly steered the game into a position where the Russian had to repeat moves. Probably only Joseph Blackburne&apos;s 14/16 at Berlin 1881 and Nigel Short&apos;s tied first at Amsterdam 1991, ahead of Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov, are comparable to Adams&apos;s Dortmund.

The question now is whether Adams can carry his brilliant streak to the 128-player World Cup knock-out which starts on Sunday in Tromso, Norway.

Rothbart&apos;s a drug-dealing pimp. Prince Siegfried is a bit of a lad; his gaudily clad mates even more so. The scenes, switching between a grand mansion and a seedy canalside, are set for Fredrik Rydman&apos;s Swan Lake Reloaded. Oh, and then there&apos;s the score, which is one moment Tchaikovsky, the next Swedish electro. &quot;Jeez,&quot; said my friend, &quot;I thought you had to go to Edinburgh to see this sort of thing.&quot; It&apos;s fabulous though. Daniel Koivunen as Rothbart calls in his addict swans by text in an attention-grabbing opener, projection making it like Tom Cruise on the computer in Minority Report. Koivunen is lithe and absolutely terrifying, more scary than any other I have seen in the role. The swans crawl out of the depths shaking with desire to get their hits. Rydman, who is about to turn 39, was part of Bounce, a street-dance collective most famous for getting flashmobs to perform Michael Jackson&apos;s Beat It in various public places. This sensibility is instilled in Swan Lake Reloaded. Fredrik &quot;Kaos&quot; Wentzel, as the jester, performs astonishing feats that include an attempt on Odile&apos;s infamously taxing 32\u00a0fouett\u00e9s \u2013 only he spins on his head. The story remains the same. Siegfried, unimpressed by the women presented to him at court, finds obsession in Odette. The difference is that he first sees her dancing in an Amsterdam-style prostitute&apos;s shopfront and is later confused into mistaking her for Odile when Rothbart plies him with drugs. There are quibbles. The women \u2013 tremendous dancers \u2013 are underused. The infatuation between Siegfried and Odette is unconvincing. There is more than a hint of the circus. And a fair chunk of the Swedish music is appalling. Set against this are superbly rendered sets and costumes, dancing that is physical and exact, a wonderful mixing of Tchaikovsky&apos;s great score and the contemporary dance music (if only it were better!), imaginative and unconstrained choreography that rises above the pyrotechnics \u2013 and enough properly realised characters to keep you gripped. Rydman came to this idea, he has said, &quot;standing in front of a vintage boutique in Camden\u2026 I was thinking the white furs hanging the window looked like swans&quot;. Certainly, other versions \u2013 Matthew Bourne&apos;s \u2013 are more profound, but this had moments that will remain with me. Odette&apos;s dance where the yearning for heroin kicks in sees a cockroach projected on to her skin, moving up her veins, then multiplying. There&apos;s a chase scene that took me to the edge of my seat. Best of all is Rydman&apos;s reworking of the pas de quatre, which starts with the swans on the floor, bare feet pointed towards the audience. It&apos;s a wonderful piece of dancethat perfectly matches the architecture of the setting. The show drew a crowd of twentysomethings the like of which I have rarely seen at the ballet. Rydman is a star ascending. Swan Lake Reloaded showed a understanding of spectacle matched by a talent for storytelling. After the high-octane finale I wondered briefly about nuance and emotion, but then relaxed, happy in the knowledge that I&apos;d just had a great time.", "sentences": ["The difference is that he first sees her dancing in an Amsterdam-style prostitute&apos;s shopfront and is later confused into mistaking her for Odile when Rothbart plies him with drugs."], "title": "Swan Lake Reloaded \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/11/swan-lake-reloaded-review", "tags": ["Dance", "Stage", "Ballet", "Pyotr Tchaikovsky", "Culture", "Swan Lake"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-11T12:25:00Z", "article": "The Dutch singer Rita Reys, who has died aged 88, was perhaps too committed a cabaret artist in her later years to sustain the international jazz reputation enjoyed by such European vocalists as Cleo Laine, Annie Ross, Karin Krog or Norma Winstone. Yet Reys was a performer of subtle timing, warmth and musicality, who intelligently and sensitively drew upon American influences such as Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan. Reys received heartfelt accolades from judges as sussed as Tony Bennett and Michel Legrand, and at her performance in 1960 at the Juan-les-Pins jazz festival, she was even dubbed &quot;Europe&apos;s first lady of jazz&quot; \u2013 a title that stuck with her for life. She was born in Rotterdam and \u2013 with a violinist/conductor for a father and a dancer for a mother \u2013 grew up taking performance for granted. As a child, she heard only classical music at home, but as a teenage singer, she began winning local talent competitions. At 19, when she met the jazz drummer Wessel Ilcken, she was introduced to jazz. She married Ilcken, joined his sextet and toured the Netherlands. She appeared with the bassist Ted Powder in Belgium and Luxembourg, and with the Piet van Dijk orchestra in Spain and north Africa, between 1945 and 1950. Reys then began leading her own group with Ilcken, toured England, and, after moving to Stockholm in 1953, made her first recordings with leading Swedish musicians including the baritone saxophonist Lars Gullin. She also got acquainted with many American artists regularly visiting the country, including Ella Fitzgerald, Lester Young and the trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie, Quincy Jones, Clifford Brown and Art Farmer.            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view video The Columbia Records producer George Avakian invited her to the US in 1956, and she recorded The Cool Voice of Rita Reys with an A-list bebop lineup including Art Blakey, Horace Silver and Donald Byrd, musicians with whom she also performed at New York&apos;s Village Vanguard. Reys also worked in the US with the organist Jimmy Smith, began a lifelong friendship with Bennett and later returned to the Vanguard with the drummer Chico Hamilton&apos;s band. Ilcken died of a brain haemorrhage in 1957. Reys stayed on the road to support herself and their daughter, Leila \u2013 working in Germany with the celebrated bandleader Kurt Edelhagen and pianist Bengt Hallberg, and in Paris with Young. Reys also began performing with Ilcken&apos;s pianist Pim Jacobs, whom she married in 1960. In 1969 she became the first Dutch jazz singer to perform at the New Orleans jazz festival (the city went on to make her a citizen of honour 11 years later). In middle age, Reys shifted toward a more broadly popular repertoire, collaborating with the conductor and arranger Rogier van Otterloo and his orchestra on Rita Reys Sings Burt Bacharach and Rita Reys Sings Michel Legrand (both of which won the Dutch music industry&apos;s Edison award), and later on songbook projects dedicated to George Gershwin and Antonio Carlos Jobim. Reys was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1985, but kept the news from the press and was back onstage with Jacobs at a sold-out Amsterdam Concertgebouw within weeks of surgery \u2013 a gig she subsequently recognised as &quot;a new start&quot;. She made a Christmas album with Jacobs and Amsterdam&apos;s Metropole Orchestra in 1986. She also recorded two American Songbook albums with Jacobs \u2013 these were their last recordings before his death from cancer in 1996. Accompanied by the pianist Lex Jasper, Reys went back on the road, recorded the albums Loss of Love \u2013 Rita Reys Sings Henry Mancini and (for her 75th birthday) The Lady Strikes Again, and in 2004 collaborated on the autobiography Rita Reys, Lady Jazz with the journalist Bert Vuijsje. She dedicated the 2004 album Beautiful Love to Jacobs and made the 2010 album Young at Heart with the saxophonist Scott Hamilton and the organist Thijs van Leer. An inspiringly spirited and much-loved artist whose reputation in the Netherlands never waned, Reys&apos; remarkable life in her homeland fulfilled Legrand&apos;s prediction, after her 1972 interpretations of his work: &quot;From now on, every time I will write a song, I will think of the great Rita Reys, who sings the love songs with such love, that I really love her \u2013 and you will too.&quot; She is survived by Leila. \u2022 Rita Maria Everdina Reys, singer, born 21 December 1924; died 28 July 2013", "sentences": ["Reys was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1985, but kept the news from the press and was back onstage with Jacobs at a sold-out Amsterdam Concertgebouw within weeks of surgery \u2013 a gig she subsequently recognised as &quot;a new start&quot;.", "She made a Christmas album with Jacobs and Amsterdam&apos;s Metropole Orchestra in 1986."], "title": "Rita Reys obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/11/rita-reys", "tags": ["Jazz", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-13T14:51:00Z", "article": "Interviewed before the first UK performance of The Moth Requiem, given in this BBC Singers concert under Nicholas Kok as part of the Proms Chamber Music series, Harrison Birtwistle recalled how as a young man he was fascinated by natural history in general and moths in particular \u2013 an interest he returned to in this 20-minute choral work premiered last year in Amsterdam.

That&apos;s especially true where infrastructure is weak and investments must start from scratch. In trying to protect the vulnerable, some fail to understand this commercial reality. They expect immediate benefits and if they don&apos;t come in less than a year then they damn the project as land-grabbing or a reason for ending all biofuels. Meeting sustainability standards should be made less complicated and expensive for developing countries: Achieving sustainability is good for business because you become more efficient, profitable and competitive as a result. But it&apos;s expensive to achieve and to prove by means of certification. Ever changing standards are difficult to apply to developing country circumstances. Helping groups that don&apos;t yet achieve sustainability standards is broader than just auditing against a set of criteria in order to get a certificate. More needs to be done in the agricultural production process, primarily but not exclusively, in order to even begin to reach for those standards. Resources: CleanStar Mozambique has developed an integrated supply chain teaching farmers how to improve their yields through agroforestry. Farmers produce food crops, including cassava that is later used for flour or for ethanol production, as well as fruit and oil trees. The ethanol is then sold into the clean cooking fuel market Siwa Msangi, senior research fellow, International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington DC, US. @ifpri Energy policies should be tailored to country needs: Africa&apos;s needs are very different from those in the EU. Africa&apos;s energy problems go much deeper to questions of basic infrastructure, and are made harder by the fact that there are so many land-locked countries facing high import prices for everything. Don&apos;t encourage smallholders to plant low-value crops: One of my concerns with how biofuels is being done in developing countries is the promotion of jatropha to smallholders. It may be easy enough to plant, but don&apos;t overlook its low productivity and the lack of readily-usable and valuable co-products (which other edible oilseeds have). I think this plant needs 20 yrs of solid research and development before we can promote it to smallholders, otherwise we&apos;re just transferring risk onto those who can least afford it \u2013 and have to wait three years before they can get their first poor harvest. Mairon G Bastos Lima, PhD researcher in Brazil, Institute for Environmental Studies, VU University Amsterdam. @MaironGBL National biodiesel policies are crucial for making programmes sustainable and locally valuable: Without policies, the equity and sustainability of biofuel production become dependent on the eventual good will of some entrepreneurs. We need to learn from the Nigerian and Brazilian biodiesel policies, which have been limited but has accrued some tangible benefits to small farmers after it demanded features such as mixed food and feedstock cultivation to safeguard food security and the endorsement of a representative social movement or farmer union, to improve their bargaining power face industry. What we still miss are strategies to promote local value. A transition to multipurpose agriculture is inevitable: From an industrial perspective, biomass offers replacements not only for energy but also for a large number of materials today produced from fossil fuels. From a political perspective, biofuel production and biomass-based value-chains offer economic opportunities that agricultural sectors and agriculturally strong countries will simply not forgo. By now more than 50 countries have biofuel policies in place; the issue cannot be reduced to the EU directive. We ought to learn how to make that transition sustainable. Support smallholder farmers to move up the value chain: If we want to talk about equitable agricultural development, we need to see who controls and profits from each stage of the value-chain. So long as small farmers remain only at the bottom, with the least-valuable stage of production, poverty may be alleviated but inequality is maintained. Local capacity building, a term so far missing here, is therefore critical. Richard Bennett, CEO, Sunbird Bioenergy, London, UK. @Sunbird_Biofuel African countries can learn from Nigeria&apos;s clear agricultural policies: Strong political policy from the Nigerian federal ministry of agriculture and rural development is delivering the country&apos;s agricultural transformation agenda that seeks to develop sustainable out-growers programmes, create local wealth and improve living conditions, particularly for women. They have also introduced the new alliance for food security that helps balance food security and energy security policy. Vincent Okello, programme development officer, Practical Action, Kisumu, Kenya Don&apos;t overlook the positivie and negative impacts of biofuels used for household energy: According to the GACC, cooking with biomass fuels such as firewood and crop waste, burnt over open fires and in poorly ventilated houses, contributes to a global disease burden of almost 4m deaths per year. In order to reduce this burden, it is proposed that the use of clean fuels such as biofuels, specifically alcohol stoves, for cooking, offer a much more realistic shot at clean indoor air for cooks and their families. Anna Locke, head of agricultural development and policy programme, ODI, London, UK. @odi_development Studies that look at the impacts of growing biofuels must be multi-dimensional: Too often, studies analysing the impacts of growing biofuels focus only on one element of food security, such as access to land, without looking at the impact on other aspects of food availability and access to food. Focus on planet, people and profit: If biofuel production continues because the price of oil makes it competitive, then we need to ensure they don&apos;t have negative environmental or social impacts, but are economically viable. One step that would benefit biofuels and other investment projects is to improve the transparency of land tenure conditions and procedures, and the process of making and implementing decisions that underpin that. Rachel Noble, policy researcher, ActionAid UK, London, UK. @ActionAidUK Biofuels have potential to transform renewable energy if they&apos;re sustainable: Bioenergy through sustainable advanced biofuels could make a small but significant contribution to meeting the 10% renewable energy transport target set by the EU&apos;s renewable energy directive. ActionAid calculates this contribution could be about 6% by 2020. However, the sustainability of advanced biofuels is far from guaranteed and member states, including the UK, must put in place sufficient policies and safeguards before we embrace this technology. Current EU policies don&apos;t address social impacts: Currently there are no binding social criteria attached to biofuels that can be counted towards EU targets. Countries are only obliged to &apos;report&apos; on the social impacts. However, research has shown that the current EU biofuels target is driving land-grabbing in developing countries in a context where one in eight people go to bed hungry every night. We fully agree there is a need for nuance in this debate, but the wider facts should also not be ignored. Sean O&apos;Hanlon, chief technical officer, Advanced Algae Solutions, Miami, US. @Sean_OHanlon Rotation or inter-cropping can allow for food and biofuels: It could be useful to plan to grow food and biofuels on the same land. This could be done either by crop rotation or by inter-cropping, and would give farmers double the income, if not more, depending upon growing cycles of the chosen crops. David Healy, policy and advocacy officer, Oxfam, Dublin, Ireland. @OxfamIreland The EU biofuels policy is leading to less secure, more expensive food and climate change: Oxfam is campaigning to change the EU&apos;s biofuels policy because it is driving land-grabs in developing countries, leading to dispossession and food insecurity. The inflexible nature of the targets is leading to food price spikes with negative impacts on food and nutrition security. When indirect impacts are taken into account, much of the biofuel production is as bad as or worse for the climate than fossil fuels, often with other negative impacts also.

The American comic bounces into London jet-lagged and bleary, slurping coffee from a paper cup. He has a gilded status as a Hollywood clown and a glossy fiancee in Olivia Wilde, formerly of House. He is not in Kansas any more; the place is a memory. But he is poking all kinds of fun at red-state USA. We&apos;re the Millers casts 37-year-old Sudeikis as a Denver-based pot-dealer who changes his hairstyle and his surname in order to pass as a tourist and smuggle drugs across the Mexican border. Disguise complete, our hero chugs towards the checkpoint in a respectable motorhome, with TLC&apos;s Waterfalls playing on the stereo. Inside sit two tonnes of narcotics and a fake American family cobbled together from the neighbourhood deadbeats. I\u00a0liked the film: it&apos;s slick and funny, a\u00a0meld of Pineapple Express and Addams Family Values. Jennifer Aniston co-stars as the phoney wife, whose pole-dancing day job gets the phoney son aroused. We&apos;re the Millers also serves as a neat calling-card for Sudeikis. Aided by the wardrobe department, he makes a startling transformation from David Clarke to David Miller. One minute he is a shambling Jason Segel type, a stubbled cherub gone to seed. The next he is a new-model Steve Carell, cornfed and uptight, his eyes on the prize. And yes, he says, the Miller gene is in his DNA. &quot;I was raised in the suburbs of Kansas City. Minivans and khakis and culs-de-sac. Wearing polos and tucking them in. We were allowed to play hide-and-seek until the wee hours and there was no crime to speak of.&quot; He grins. &quot;I\u00a0mean, I got in trouble for doing, like, nothing. It\u00a0shows you&apos;re living in a\u00a0safe environment when the cops come to your house at 10.30 on a Saturday to tell you to stop playing basketball. Some neighbour had complained about the sound of the ball bouncing.&quot; That&apos;s it? That&apos;s the extent of his wild-youth stories? &quot;That&apos;s it, I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m not Jay Z.&quot;     Sudeikis: after 10 years on Saturday Night Live, he thinks the time is right to move into film. Photograph: Rex Features/Broadimage    When Sudeikis was a\u00a0kid, his uncle, George Wendt, had a long-running gig playing Norm, the mordant barfly in the sitcom Cheers. Sudeikis remembers going to visit him in LA and being driven around in a flashy BMW. But he stresses that he was never especially drawn to that world in his youth (&quot;I\u00a0was never a child actor, I was child smart-ass&quot;). On the whole he preferred goofing off and dreamed of becoming a professional athlete. Eventually, he left home to play college basketball. The door opens and a waiter enters carrying a pot of coffee. Sudeikis brandishes his cup. &quot;Not for me; I\u00a0brought my own. Because I heard you\u00a0guys piss in the coffee.&quot; The waiter bends to pour out the coffee. His face is a perfect blank. Sudeikis was born without a sense of smell. If his drink contained urine, he would have to taste it to know for sure. If his room sprang a gas leak, he would probably wind up dead. &quot;Well, yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;It nearly happened when I was a kid. Our laundry was downstairs and my dad came down to the basement where I lived during my last few years of high school. &apos;Jeez, Jason, what&apos;s going on?&apos; The sump-pump had broken. It was leaking methane gas and I had no idea. I had headaches for two days afterwards.&quot; Every day the man takes his life in his hands. It is as though he is constantly crossing a busy road blindfolded. Sudeikis shrugs. &quot;I don&apos;t know how I cope, I guess I just evolved. The thing about me is that I&apos;m exactly like Daredevil.&quot; When the college basketball did not pan out, he turned to comedy. He\u00a0performed improv in Chicago, Amsterdam and Las Vegas, shouting to be heard above the\u00a0whir of the slot machines. In\u00a02003, he landed a job on Saturday Night Live, which has been his base for the past 10 years. Sudeikis wrote the scripts and cavorted on screen, doing impressions of everyone from Bill Clinton to Mel Gibson, Joe Biden to James Stewart. But now he is moving on, giving movies a\u00a0shot. In recent years he has cropped up in the likes of Hall Pass, Movie 43 and Horrible Bosses.           &quot;Memorising lines is the biggest difference,&quot; he says. &quot;On Saturday Night Live, things keep changing up until the very last second, so that&apos;s why we use cue-cards. But in film there are no cue-cards, at least not yet, not until you become Marlon Brando and start sticking bits of face tape on the actor you&apos;re talking to. If I tried that now, I don&apos;t think Jen would have liked it.&quot; He shakes his head. &quot;In any case, I\u00a0don&apos;t want to cover up Jennifer Aniston&apos;s face with my Post-it notes. That&apos;s vandalism.&quot; Right now he is in limbo. Having left Saturday Night Live, he finds himself between movies, cut loose, without a structure. He points out that Wilde has been helpful in this regard, having herself quit a role in House. Even so, it&apos;s a weird time. On the one hand, he has the sense that he has somehow arrived. On the other, he can&apos;t yet tell exactly where he has landed.     Border run: Jennifer Aniston, Will Poulter, Emma Roberts and Jason Sudeikis in a scene from We're the Millers. Photograph: Michael Tackett/AP    He explains that Wilde was going to\u00a0accompany him to London, but he advised against it. He didn&apos;t want her at a loose end while he promoted his movie, which in hindsight is ridiculous \u2013 she would have found something to do. &quot;I\u00a0mean, I shouldn&apos;t think, &apos;Oh, just\u00a0because you can&apos;t be around me means you won&apos;t have any fun, you&apos;d just be channel-surfing in a hotel room.&apos;&quot; He pulls a face. &quot;Maybe that&apos;s what I assume everyone&apos;s doing when I&apos;m not there. I\u00a0assume that&apos;s what you&apos;ve been doing\u00a0all your life, until this very moment.&quot; Sudeikis grins at me across the table. &quot;But it&apos;s OK, relax.

NBC&apos;s hilarious video, which features Jason Sudeikis, was filmed at Tottenham Hotspur and also provides cameo roles for some of its best players, including Gareth Bale. Meanwhile, over at Manchester United, their top team has been somewhat distracted by the talents of the magician, Dynamo. But, just in case you thought football was all about laughs and having a good time, Hull&apos;s owner, Assem Allam, reveals some of the hard facts about being an owner. His desire to change the name of the club has caused a lot of controversy and some of his revelations about his interest in the beautiful game aren&apos;t exactly going to win over his critics. But we&apos;ve got more than just the latest football buzz. Take a look at Louise Minchin&apos;s interview on BBC Breakfast with a mosquito expert. For once, the usually cool Mr Minchin does gnat know what to do \u2026 Ellen DeGeneres is a lady who is used to being in control. The recently announced host of the next Oscars ceremony is also accustomed to being supported by a strong production team.

Topless men with flawless physiques perform camp manoeuvres on a stage. As Ibiza&apos;s flagship club, Pacha, celebrated its 40th year of existence, its denizens were in party mood last week. Built in 1973 on former wasteland, a place that started life as an all-night cosy party venue attended by friends, hippies and locals has become the venue of choice for those with deep pockets. Entry can be as much as \u20ac100 (\u00a385), or \u20ac440 for a VIP table, &quot;mixer&quot; drinks are around \u20ac20 and a bottle of water costs \u20ac12. But for those able to afford it, all the fabled glamour of Ibiza is here. Outside it is something of a different story. For all the hands-in-the-air moments, this ever-popular hedonistic island has a dark side that is getting darker. Ibiza is now operating at two different speeds. On the streets of San Antonio, &quot;looky looky&quot; men loiter and ask people if they want to buy sunglasses, and then ask if they want drugs. &quot;I&apos;ve seen English dealers running after them at the end of the season when they don&apos;t pay their debts,&quot; said Peter Nee, Privilege club PR manager. &quot;The police chase them on their bikes sometimes, but it&apos;s all cat and mouse.&quot; Following the arrest in Peru of Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, from Co Tyrone, and Melissa Reid, 19, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, who were stopped at Lima airport for allegedly smuggling \u00a31.5m of cocaine, Ibiza&apos;s drug culture is in the headlines again. Like hundreds of others, Connolly and Reid had spent the summer working in clubs and bars on the island, where the lure of illicit substances, to consume or sell, is constant. In the early days, there was a &quot;happy&quot; drug culture of marijuana, then LSD in the 1970s and ecstasy in the 1990s. Now, people opt for ketamine, GHB and cocaine. Given the high prices in clubs such as Pacha, some succumb to the lavish lifestyle by dealing drugs; others fall into a pattern of free parties at villas and on yachts, sometimes thrown by dubious hosts. Many avoid overpriced drinks altogether, taking drugs as a far cheaper alternative. This young summer workforce, employed as dancers, flyer distributors, waiters and hospitality staff, earn just about enough to live. The Spanish landlords of the cramped apartments, where two or three people share a room, charge them around half their monthly pay. There is hot competition for each job and a constant tussle to get the bar and restaurant owners to pay them the right amount, and on time. Fern Bowler, 20, from Guildford, Surrey, a waitress in San Antonio, said she could see how people can fall into the Ibiza drug culture. &quot;Dealing over here isn&apos;t like back home, it&apos;s normal,&quot; she said. &quot;Doing ketamine would be frowned on in the UK, but here every Tom, Dick and Harry does it. &quot;They sell drugs behind the bars and some people even brought some over with them in protein tubs. Nothing is innocent here.&quot; Another worker, who has been here for five summers, agreed: &quot;Workers on the island can easily fall into the wrong circles. &quot;It&apos;s not the first time someone on the island will have done this. When they look at those girls, people are saying: &apos;It could have been me&apos;.&quot; In July, a British mother of two drowned after going for a late-night swim in Ibiza having taken a cocktail of illegal drugs. Next day, her body was found washed up on the shore. In recent weeks, Grant Weston, 24, from Pembroke, died after falling from a balcony following a night out with friends, and Michael Jordan Hill, 19, from Stockton-on-Tees, Co Durham, was seriously injured after falling from the fourth floor of a hotel. But despite the seamier underside to life on the island, its reputation and prestige persist. More than 600,000 Brits went on holiday to Ibiza in 2012 and tour operators are reporting even higher booking levels this year. Clearly, though, something has been lost through the sheer commercial success of the Ibiza brand. Terry Farley, co-founder of the record label Junior Boys Own, whose artists have included Underworld and the Chemical Brothers, has been going to the island since the early 1990s. He thinks the VIP culture of clubs such as Pacha has become a micro-climate of corporate brands and a world turned upside down by money: &quot;The VIP culture has ruined the island for everyone \u2013 apart from investment bankers and drug dealers,&quot; he said. Bill Brewster, co-author of Last Night a DJ Saved my Life, said: &quot;It always had that element of celebrity, but it never felt like that; it felt like everybody dancing together in a cosmopolitan way. &quot;I do still enjoy it, but the purity of it all has been dissipated by the money. For me, it seems to be a bit of a cash cow for British promoters to fleece gullible clubbers of their money.&quot; Though many former punters might agree with that assessment, there are more than enough new recruits to take their place. But after the events of last week, the high-roller side of the island has been overshadowed by the story unfolding in Peru. The Spanish owner of the Amsterdam bar in San Antonio, where McCollum Connolly briefly worked, has lived in Ibiza for 40 years. He said drugs were ruining the island. &quot;It&apos;s run by an English mafia between Manchester and Liverpool, there were shootings between them a few years ago. Two people have died from drugs just in the last few weeks.&quot; He added: &quot;Ibiza destroys young people. It&apos;s paradise, but it&apos;s also hell.&quot;", "sentences": ["The Spanish owner of the Amsterdam bar in San Antonio, where McCollum Connolly briefly worked, has lived in Ibiza for 40 years."], "title": "Ibiza: 'Nothing is innocent and dealing is normal'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/17/ibiza-drugs-dark-side", "tags": ["Spain", "Ibiza holidays", "Drugs trade", "Clubbing", "Music", "Drugs", "Society", "Spain holidays", "Europe holidays", "Travel", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-18T11:00:00Z", "article": "The case for living in the country      Big city glamor? Balderdash. Try big city cost. If you want to live like a king (or at least be your own landlord), move to the country.  1. It&apos;s cheap. You have to actively try to spend more than $20 on a meal, even a good one. A movie still costs single digits. No one has a clue or cares what brand of clothing you&apos;re wearing, let alone whether your shoes, purse or belt are this year&apos;s season or last. And did I mention housing? You can live in a real house with multiple bedrooms, multiple bathrooms and a garage. Maybe even a pool. And you can own it for under $200,000. Yup, you read that right. I didn&apos;t leave off any zeros.       2. There&apos;s space \u2013 for you, for your dog, for your kids, between you and your annoying neighbors. An ad on the NY subway sums up: &quot;Raising a baby in an NYC apartment is like growing an oak tree in a thimble.&quot; In the city, you live on top of each other. Your kids and your dog barely know what grass is. In the country, you have something called a yard. You run around, kick a football and chase fireflies. You go sledding and build snowmen on fresh snow that hasn&apos;t been trodden by hundreds of others. You can actually identify constellations because you see lots of them each night. You are fascinated by a lot more interesting animals than squirrels, and your dog acts like a dog, you don&apos;t have to carry around bags for its poop.  3. There are no billionaires. And frankly, few millionaires. To put it another way, there&apos;s a lot less income inequality. Since the cost of living is much lower, even those on the median family income (about $50,000 in the US) can have a decent life. You don&apos;t feel poor as you do in big cities where even those earning six-figures still believe they&apos;re &quot;just getting by&quot;. In the country, you aren&apos;t constantly aware of your socioeconomic status. You worry a lot more about the weather. 4. You aren&apos;t reliant on public transit. You don&apos;t have to push your way onto an overcrowded subway car only to find yourself squashed next to someone who smells or elbows you. You aren&apos;t late because there&apos;s been a delay and some robot-like voice has to tell you about it over and over on the speaker. You can drive yourself where you want, when you want. Even if there&apos;s traffic (and there isn&apos;t much outside of cities), you can usually find another way to go. You are in control, and there&apos;s plenty of (free) parking. 5. You don&apos;t get suspicious when people are nice to you. People say hello and &quot;how are you&quot; and generally mean it. You go to the grocery store and have a decent chance of seeing at least someone you know. Your doctor actually calls you back the same day you call with a concern. People don&apos;t size you up constantly based upon your job, social status or income. Volunteer work isn&apos;t something you do for your resume. You feel a part of a genuine community, not just one peon out of millions. The case for living in the city      The countryside? It must be nice if you&apos;re retired \u2026 or dead. If you want to have a semblance of a social life and like to do wild things like, oh, going to the cinema on a Monday night, the city is for you. 1. Walking. It&apos;s a thing. Forget about having to spend a quarter of your paycheck on a car. Forget about feeding your second-hand beater gallons of earth-destroying gas on a weekly basis. And (unless you live in LA) forget about spending two hours a day stuck in traffic. Living in the city means that walking is often an option. And if it&apos;s not, commuting by public transport makes you feel like you&apos;re part of the world: you and others are on the same boat, so to speak, taking time to pause and read, or listen to music, before reaching work or going home. And, from London to Paris, Amsterdam to Vancouver, chances are you will be also be lucky enough to be able to bike everywhere \u2013 making you both fitter and happier.  2. You will never be the underdog.  As Daria would tell you, it sucks to be the odd one out. If you&apos;re a goth, head to London&apos;s Camden Town, which will love to have you. You like playing in all-female netball teams? You&apos;ll find a club. Love mushroom-hunting? Start your own group. In Sydney, where I live, my local park alone is the home to joggers, skateboarders, tai chi lovers and tight-rope walkers. There&apos;s something for everyone. And kiss bigotry goodbye, too: if you&apos;re gay, you will easily find both a welcoming environment. And better dating prospects.      The countryside: not like Gilmore Girls    3. The entire world is (almost) on your doorstep. I don&apos;t know about you, but it would be a shame to die on the way to the hospital \u2013\u00a0or give birth on the side of a road. Which probably won&apos;t happen in the city. You can order anything from online stores and \u2013 miracle! \u2013\u00a0receive it the next day. Museums, galleries, libraries are easily accessible, a lot of them free. And food: enough said. Who likes to have the choice only between a grim pub serving dismal burgers or fish-and-chips and the local Subway branch at the back of a derelict mall? Not me. 4. It teaches you tolerance. The world is a diverse place \u2013\u00a0and in the city, you learn that fast. There&apos;s a reason New Yorkers are considered to be the most thick-skinned people on earth: nothing fazes them, because no one has time to be fazed and they&apos;ve seen it all anyway. Someone is rude to on the subway? Move along. Someone cuts you while queuing in the supermarket? Get ahead and get even. But cities also teach patience and empathy because, after all, you&apos;re all in this together. Compromise is in the very fabric of city living. Neighbours complaining about your Saturday party? You have to reach an agreement. People who don&apos;t act, think, or speak like you do? Kids who annoy you by listening to rap music in the bus? They share your space, too. And you, theirs. It&apos;s an imperfect and fragile microcosm, which, no matter its many drawbacks, seems to work. Almost like magic. 5. The countryside is not like living in Gilmore Girls. If you think the countryside is like living on the idyllic Gilmore Girls&apos; set, you&apos;re mistaken. Nor are you likely to live the Good Life, a la Helen and Scott Nearing, who fed themselves thanks to their homestead until they both died. True country-living means backbreaking work, including thankless chores performed before dawn. Here in Sydney, I pop to the corner shop to get eggs at midnight if I want. And if you&apos;re not a true back-to-the-lander living on a 120-acre farm in the middle of nowhere, you then have to live in a community where everything you do will be scrutinised. Privacy will be hard to maintain. No such thing will happen in the city, where people couldn&apos;t care less whether you like to walk around with your pet snake, like to wear mini-skirts in sub-freezing weather, or sing Bryan Adams&apos; Everything I Do I Do It For You out loud while on your way to buy a baguette. Short of becoming a hermit, if you&apos;re a private individual or an introvert, city life is for you.", "sentences": ["And, from London to Paris, Amsterdam to Vancouver, chances are you will be also be lucky enough to be able to bike everywhere \u2013 making you both fitter and happier."], "title": "City v country: where's the better place to live? | Head to head", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/18/live-in-city-or-country", "tags": ["Life and style", "Housing", "Family", "Work-life balance", "Farming"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-19T14:35:57Z", "article": "By 2050, flood damage in the world&apos;s coastal cities is expected to reach $1 trillion a year as sea levels rise and global warming triggers new extremes of heat, windstorm and rain. More than 40% of these prodigious costs could fall upon just four cities \u2013 New Orleans, Miami and New York in the US and Guangzhou in China. Stephane Hallegatte of the World Bank in Washington and colleagues looked at the risks of future flood losses in the 136 largest of the world&apos;s coastal cities. Any coastal city is always at some risk \u2013 by definition it is at sea level, and often on an estuary or floodplain, and very often began as a seaport. But risks increase as the environment changes: some coastal cities are subsiding; sea levels are slowly but surely rising as the oceans warm and the glaciers melt; and for two decades researchers have repeatedly warned that what used to be &quot;extreme&quot; events such as once-in-a-century floods are likely to arrive considerably more often than once a century. But, Hallegatte and colleagues point out in Nature Climate Change, there is another factor: populations are growing, and even in the poorest nations there is greater economic development. At bottom, for any future disaster, there will be more potential victims, with more investment to lose. In 2005, average global flood losses are estimated to have reached $6 billion a year. This figure is expected to grow to $50 billion a year, and unless cities put money into better flood defences, losses could pass the $1 trillion mark. To make their calculations, the authors matched average annual losses (and in a city like New Orleans, much of it already below sea level, this is estimated at $600 million) against a city&apos;s gross domestic product, to provide a measure of how much should be set aside to pay for such losses. Both New York and New Orleans have already undergone catastrophic flooding this century, and flood hazard can only increase. Some cities \u2013 Amsterdam in the Netherlands is a classic example \u2013 are highly exposed to flood risk, and the once-a-century flood could cost the Dutch $83 billion, but in fact Dutch sea defence standards are probably the highest in the world. Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and Alexandria in Egypt have less to lose, but in relative terms both are far more vulnerable. Prophecies such as these are intended to be proved wrong: the idea is that a prophet warns of horrors to come, people take steps, and as a consequence the horrors do not arrive. But as disaster professionals have learned again and again, governments, city authorities, investors and even citizens tend not to listen to prophecies of doom: scientists and engineers repeatedly described what could happen to New Orleans if it was hit by a powerful-enough hurricane, and in 2005, as Hurricane Katrina arrived, the levees gave way, with catastrophic results. But, the scientists warn, Miami, New York and New Orleans are especially vulnerable, because wealth is high but protection systems are poor, and governments should be prepared for disasters more devastating than any experienced today. The paper&apos;s authors argue that with systematic preparedness and adaptation, annual flood losses in the great global cities could be cut to $63 billion a year. Engineering projects can help, but will not be enough, so civic authorities should also be thinking about disaster planning and comprehensive insurance programmes to cover future losses. Since risks are highly concentrated \u2013 any city piles millions of people and billions of dollars of investment into a relatively small area \u2013 flood reduction schemes could be highly cost-effective.", "sentences": ["Some cities \u2013 Amsterdam in the Netherlands is a classic example \u2013 are highly exposed to flood risk, and the once-a-century flood could cost the Dutch $83 billion, but in fact Dutch sea defence standards are probably the highest in the world."], "title": "Coastal cities face $1 trillion floods by 2050: study", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/19/coastal-cities-trillion-floods-2050", "tags": ["Flooding", "World news", "Environment", "Natural disasters and extreme weather"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-19T20:01:00Z", "article": "It is a new low for British &quot;democracy&quot; when those who seek to defend us against excessive surveillance are targeted by &quot;anti-terrorist&quot; powers (Greenwald&apos;s partner detained at Heathrow, 18 August). The problem is not who &quot;really&quot; is a terror suspect; rather, that these powers permit detention and questioning of individuals without any defined threshold of suspicion or need to give a reason. It is the only power in British law that gives police carte blanche to go fishing for information about political or religious activities or \u2013 as in this case \u2013 journalistic sources, in a way that gives the victim no right to silence or legal support. In fact, as your coverage correctly points out, it is an arrestable offence to refuse to answer any question, however unreasonable. The proposals in the antisocial behaviour, crime and policing bill, to reduce the nine hours to six and allow access to a solicitor only after search and questioning has taken place, fail to address the Big Brother quality of these powers. There also seem to be no safeguards against unreasonable seizure of phones, computers or other property. This outrageous incident underlines the need to amend the bill drastically before it becomes law. Anne GrayLondon \u2022\u2008I have attended on several occasions to advise persons detained under schedules 7 and 8 of the Terrorism Act 2000. In my experience schedule 7 interviews are often conducted in a &quot;no man&apos;s land&quot; where the airport authority can override police and deny a lawyer access to their client if the lawyer does not happen to be carrying their passport with them (even if the lawyer can satisfy the police as to their identity). The lawyer has to attend in person since it is an imprisonable offence for the lawyer even to generally advise not to answer questions: ie the lawyer has to decide on a question-by-question basis what to advise. Not many experienced lawyers are able to attend at such short notice. Police are not bound to wait for the lawyer and on the outward leg of a journey a person detained is likely to be more anxious about missing their flight than waiting for legal advice or the implications of a carelessly worded reply. The police can and do use these factors to ask irrelevant questions.Name and address supplied \u2022\u2008While the detention of David Miranda is scandalous, it is certainly not the first time this &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; legislation has been used for intimidation and investigation of political dissent. I have been detained twice when re-entering the UK. The first time was in early 2008, when I returned from a holiday in Germany with my then boyfriend. We were detained by the Met&apos;s anti-terrorism unit at St Pancras station. They questioned us about military bases, Nato and other related issues, as I was then working at War Resisters&apos; International and involved in the preparation of an anti-Nato action in Brussels (organised publicly, with nonviolence guidelines). The second time was in 2011, on my way back from an anti-Nato meeting in Brussels. I was detained together with a fellow campaigner at Holyhead, this time by Welsh anti-terrorism police. While the detention must have been scary for David Miranda, I hope his case raises awareness about the wide-ranging abuse of anti-terrorism powers by police.Andreas SpeckLondon \u2022\u2008David Miranda&apos;s detention was an extreme case of a large-scale harassment, especially of Muslims and political activists monitored by MI5. Although rarely held for nine hours, many detainees have been asked questions about their political associations, religious beliefs or mundane details in MI5&apos;s files. Tom Watson MP expressed doubt that Miranda is &quot;a terrorist suspect&quot; but the political problem is the opposite: anyone detained under such powers becomes (or already was) a &quot;terror suspect&quot; by definition. Parliament shamefully legislated a broad statutory definition of terrorism and authorised powers well designed for politically motivated harassment. Increasingly, we are all terror suspects. How will we stop this large-scale injustice? Les LevidowCampaign Against Criminalising Communities (Campacc) \u2022\u2008I was stunned by the harassment of Glenn Greenwald&apos;s partner. The UK is not to be outdone by the US authorities, it seems \u2013 or is to do their bidding, as if moved by the dictates of a single political brain. This seems as good a time as any to say thank you for the tremendous work, both in breadth and timeliness, done by the Guardian in reporting on the NSA surveillance revelations. Poitras, Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill are an inspiration (as is Snowden, of course), and the paper&apos;s support of their work has opened the door for citizens like me to ask pointed and informed questions of their congressional representatives. I hope the entire Guardian staff will remain firm in its purpose to continue reporting on this story. It is one of the reasons I subscribed to your paper.Sheila NewberyBerkeley, California \u2022\u2008Please publish in full every detail of this episode at Heathrow airport, including as precisely as possible all the questions David Miranda was asked during his detention and how much officers&apos; time and other resources were spent.

The rest of us hang our reproductions in the knowledge that even the good ones are far from faithful to the originals \u2013 for which the going rate is \u00a324m. But not any more. The Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam has developed high-quality 3D reproductions of some of its finest paintings, with what it describes as the most advanced copying technique ever seen. Axel R\u00fcger, the museum&apos;s director, said: &quot;It really is the next generation of reproductions because they go into the third dimension. If you&apos;re a layman, they are pretty indistinguishable [from the originals]. Of course, if you&apos;re a connoisseur and you look more closely, you can see the difference.&quot; Each reproduction is priced \u00a322,000 \u2013 somewhat more than the cost of a postcard or poster. But the museum is hoping to increase access to pictures which, if they were sold, would go for tens of millions of pounds to Russian oligarchs or American billionaires. The 3D scanning technique has so far reproduced Almond Blossom (1890), Sunflowers (1889), The Harvest (1888), Wheatfield under Thunderclouds (1890) and Boulevard de Clichy (1887). Further ventures into Van Gogh&apos;s back catalogue are planned. Other museums are taking a close interest in the commercial potential of 3D, given that the Van Gogh museum expects to raise substantial funds from sales. The revenue will go towards planned renovations, as well as the preservation of a collection of 200 paintings, drawings and letters. R\u00fcger said: &quot;It is really fascinating to start an ambitious and commercial product of this kind. For museums, the financial situation is such that we all need to think about new products, new income streams, new business ideas to secure our finances.&quot; The replicas, called Relievos, are being created by the museum in partnership with Fujifilm, with which it has had an exclusive deal for three years. Such is the complexity of the technology, known as Reliefography, that it has taken more than seven years to develop and only three a day can be made. It combines a 3D scan of the painting with a high-resolution print. The &quot;super-accurate&quot; reproduction even extends to the frame and the back of the painting. Every Relievo is numbered and approved by a museum curator. There is a limited edition of 260 copies per painting. R\u00fcger said: &quot;This particular process has been developed with paintings in mind. The work of Van Gogh lends itself particularly well, since the pictures are so rich in surface structure. We have been working with them on the colour quality and fine-tuning.&quot; Asked whether those who could afford to pay \u00a322,000 would prefer an original painting, even if by an artist other than Van Gogh, R\u00fcger said: &quot;These are separate markets.&quot; When the series was launched in Hong Kong last month, the museum&apos;s curators chose a shopping mall rather than a gallery. &quot;There was enormous interest there. We had people there who bought on the spot,&quot; said R\u00fcger. &quot;For someone interested in Van Gogh, this is the closest you can get to the original without it being the original.

Lord Adonis, a former transport secretary and architect of the scheme, spoke out as unease spread within both Labour and Tory ranks about the rising costs and economic benefits of the plans. While the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, remains in favour of HS2, which will run initially from London to Birmingham and then, in phase two, branch off with separate lines to Manchester and Leeds, shadow chancellor Ed Balls is said to be less convinced, particularly if the costs rise above the latest sharply increased government figure of \u00a342.6bn. On Friday, Balls appeared to qualify his party&apos;s commitment, saying there could be no &quot;blank cheque from a Labour Treasury for HS2&quot;. His comments followed an intervention by another former Labour transport secretary, Alistair Darling, who called for HS2 to be abandoned, saying the money could be better spent on upgrading existing routes and other small-scale infrastructure projects. Incensed at signs that support might be fracturing, Adonis hit back in an article for the New Statesman, insisting that the case in favour was as strong as ever. Warning against cancellation or delay, he said the lessons of history had to be heeded. It would be folly, he argued, for Labour under Miliband to repeat the mistakes of Harold Wilson&apos;s government, which had cancelled plans for the Channel tunnel and a new airport at Maplin Sands in the Thames estuary after the 1974 general election. The country was still being held back because of its past failure to take big transport decisions. &quot;We are still paying the price in the current impasse over a third runway at Heathrow when the international airports serving Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt have six, four and four runways respectively. It would be a similar act of national self-mutilation to cancel HS2 in 2015, six years into the project.&quot; Insisting that the need for HS2 was more to increase capacity than speed \u2013 and countering the idea that money would be better spent elsewhere \u2013 he added: &quot;Detailed costings that I commissioned in 2009 suggested that to secure just two thirds of HS2&apos;s extra capacity by upgrading existing lines would cost more in cash terms than building HS2. So there is no free lunch or pot of gold which can be diverted to other projects in anything but the very short term, with more costly consequences thereafter.&quot; But the time saved for travellers would, nevertheless, be considerable. &quot;As HS2 proceeds further north, the time savings become steadily greater: nearly an hour off every journey between London and Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds. The connectivity benefits are also dramatic. HS2 transforms links between the Midlands and the north, as well as between London and those conurbations. HS2 includes a direct interchange with Crossrail, the new east-west underground line through London, opening in 2019, which will convey passengers to the West End, the City and Canary Wharf in a fraction of the time and with far less congestion than presently.&quot; The issue has also become divisive within the Conservatives, with former deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft saying last week that David Cameron &quot;must scrap HS2 and scrap it now&quot;. Several Tory MPs and ministers with constituencies along the proposed line fear that they will suffer at the next general election unless there is a government U-turn. Senior figures within Labour are also divided, with some on the front bench now believing that the money could be better spent building new homes and on other projects with a clearer and more obvious economic benefit. Many Labour MPs in the north believe that rather than spreading prosperity northwards \u2013 and narrowing the north-south divide \u2013 HS2 will suck even more prosperity southwards as a result of faster links.", "sentences": ["&quot;We are still paying the price in the current impasse over a third runway at Heathrow when the international airports serving Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt have six, four and four runways respectively."], "title": "Abandoning HS2 would be act of national self-mutilation, says Lord Adonis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/24/abandoning-hs2-self-mutilation-adonis", "tags": ["HS2", "Rail transport", "Transport policy", "UK news", "Andrew Adonis", "Transport", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-25T05:00:00Z", "article": "Take me there: Urban Campsite, Amsterdam A campsite near Amsterdam is offering guests the chance to spend the night in a work of art.

Friday&apos;s showpiece at the Eden stadium in Prague, he stressed, was &quot;an opportunity&quot;, though the silverware on offer was not the priority. &quot;After the Europa League last year, this is important for us,&quot; said the Chelsea manager. &quot;The Champions League is a different planet. I don&apos;t want my players to feel that, just because they did well in the Europa League, they&apos;ll do well in this competition too.&quot; Mourinho is acting as educator these days, his frequent reminders this is a young squad \u2013 certainly when compared to Bayern Munich&apos;s seasoned champions \u2013 serving to underline the long-term nature of the project he has assumed at Stamford Bridge second time round. That many of this team were at the club when Roberto Di Matteo&apos;s side oversaw victory in the elite competition at the Allianz Arena in 2012 hardly matters. This is about readjusting after last season&apos;s success in the lesser competition: a wake-up call before the confrontations with Schalke, Basel and Steaua Bucharest to come, even if the last two of their Champions League group opponents were actually beaten en route to the lesser trophy last season. All concerned would like to deliver a statement of intent in Prague. Chelsea were humiliated in this match last season, Radamel Falcao and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid running amok in Monaco with the 4-1 defeat noted by Roman Abramovich as evidence of Di Matteo&apos;s apparent limitations as a manager. The Super Cup never used to feel like a priority, but it effectively contributed heavily to the Italian&apos;s dismissal. The current squad were scarred by the whole experience. Branislav Ivanovic has spoken since of seeking redemption. Petr Cech, albeit a local keen to return to Prague, even mentioned competing in this fixture as a priority on the flight out to Amsterdam for last season&apos;s Europa League final. They will both surely play a part against Bayern. Samuel Eto&apos;o, now signed from Anzhi Makhachkala on a one-year contract, and Willian are not in the Czech Republic but Juan Mata, who has been relatively under-used to date, will hope to start with Mourinho reaffirming he remains integral at the club. &quot;He didn&apos;t play at Manchester United but I always have my reasons, and I have a duty to explain them to the players,&quot; he said. &quot;That I did. We have no problem. He&apos;s a very important player for us, I want him to stay, he wants to stay.&quot; David Luiz trained on Thursday night but he may be limited to a cameo role after hamstring trouble in a match that will test Chelsea&apos;s credentials. Bayern are under new management and Pep Guardiola is still finding his feet \u2013 &quot;The players have helped me more than I have helped them so far,&quot; admitted the Spaniard \u2013 but they are a side that still oozes power, presence and poise. &quot;Bayern&apos;s strength is the team,&quot; said Mourinho. &quot;The team is made up of end products, a team of players in the best moment of their careers. I guess their average age is 27 or 28, all very experienced, all year after year in the best competitions, not just with the club but the national team. They come from a season when they showed they were the perfect team, because only perfect teams can win the treble. So that&apos;s their best quality: this incredible footballistic power, the personality they have, and as end products they are fantastic.&quot; And, for all the Chelsea manager&apos;s attempts to deflect the subject, it will eventually come back to a duel between Mourinho and Guardiola. Chelsea had twice courted the Spaniard, immediately after Di Matteo&apos;s Champions League triumph and once they had lost faith in the Italian at the start of last season, but had been unable to convince him to come to London. Regardless, the former Bar\u00e7a manager hopes to coach in the Premier League at some stage. &quot;I&apos;d like to live that experience, but in a few years yet. Chelsea have a super trainer now. And Bayern do, too.&quot;", "sentences": ["Petr Cech, albeit a local keen to return to Prague, even mentioned competing in this fixture as a priority on the flight out to Amsterdam for last season&apos;s Europa League final."], "title": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: Super Cup gives Chelsea chance to signal their intent", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/29/jose-mourinho-chelsea-bayern-munich", "tags": ["Uefa Super Cup", "Chelsea", "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Bayern Munich", "Pep Guardiola", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-08-31T07:00:00Z", "article": "It was a beautiful spring day when I decided to go and sunbathe outside my parents&apos; house \u2013 not a cloud in the sky. I was a 21-year-old university student at the time, living with my parents in Georgia. I&apos;d spent the night before at my friend&apos;s house and when I came home the next day my mum said Dad was on his way over to have lunch with us \u2013 something he often did when he had time at work. That morning I went upstairs, put\u00a0on my new swimming costume, grabbed a towel and pillow and went out to catch some sun. Mum and I always sunbathed in our driveway \u2013 unlike our back garden, it gets much more sun. Driveways here aren&apos;t like British ones: they&apos;re usually wider and, I thought, very safe with plenty of visibility. We do it all the time around here. I was lying on my back, with the top of my head facing the street, talking to my friend on the phone, when I heard Dad driving down the road. Looking up and over my shoulder, I saw him stop and check the mail. I figured if I saw him he must have seen me.\u00a0 But he didn&apos;t. He pulled up the driveway and the front of his four-door sedan hit the back of my head and crushed it forward. My chin hit my chest.\u00a0 That was it. It was a clean break and I was paralysed from the neck down, although I didn&apos;t know it at the time.\u00a0The shock must have made my body go into automatic mode because I didn&apos;t feel any pain. I even told my friend: &quot;I just got run over. I&apos;ll call you back.&quot;\u00a0 Dad jumped out the car and that&apos;s\u00a0when he realised he&apos;d hit me. He was on autopilot, looking forward to coming inside and having\u00a0lunch with me.\u00a0 At first Dad thought he&apos;d run over a bucket lying in the drive but when\u00a0he realised he&apos;d hit me, he started crying, saying: &quot;Oh my God! I&apos;m so sorry.&quot;\u00a0 He called 911, as well as screaming for help. He kept saying: &quot;I love you. You&apos;re going to be OK.&quot; I tried to reassure him by saying: &quot;It&apos;s OK, Dad. I just can&apos;t feel my arms but I&apos;m\u00a0going to be all right.&quot; Mum came running out, yelling at the neighbours, knocking on doors and trying to get help. To this day she blames herself because she didn&apos;t call Dad and tell him I was in the driveway. At first I thought everything was fine, but when the paramedics arrived and put me on a stretcher I\u00a0found it hard to breathe. No one was allowed to ride in the air ambulance with me, so I told Dad: &quot;If\u00a0I die, don&apos;t blame yourself. I\u00a0know it was an accident. You didn&apos;t mean to do it.&quot;\u00a0 It was important to me that Dad knew that \u2013 whatever happened \u2013 and it still is.\u00a0 That night I had six-hour surgery to fuse my vertebrae together but the next morning my parents and I\u00a0listened as the doctor told me I was paralysed from the neck down. I was devastated \u2013 thankful to be alive, but unsure of what lay ahead.\u00a0 My parents and I cried but they tried to stay positive in front of me. They wanted to focus on rehab therapy and getting as much movement back as possible.\u00a0 In the days and weeks ahead Dad couldn&apos;t stop apologising. He\u00a0kept beating himself up. He was worried that I wouldn&apos;t be able to have a boyfriend or do normal things like travel or live by myself.\u00a0 But I&apos;ve never got depressed or mad at him. He still can&apos;t talk about the accident without crying. I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll ever stop feeling guilty. But every 25 March \u2013 on the anniversary of the accident \u2013 that&apos;s our day to do something together. On the five-year anniversary we went to Paris and Amsterdam but sometimes we&apos;ll just have dinner and talk.\u00a0 Even though life is different, it&apos;s still good. I can go anywhere and do anything \u2013 with the help of friends and family \u2013 like scuba-dive or hiking and camping, things that I liked to do before the accident. Looking back I&apos;m surprised that I&apos;ve come this far. I think I have a great, normal life. My boyfriend, John, and I are talking about marriage and starting a family. When I was younger I was more of a mother&apos;s girl but since the accident, I&apos;ve grown closer to Dad. I make sure I see him every day because I want him to know I&apos;m doing OK, and I know that when he sees me he feels better.\u00a0 \u2022 As told to Marissa Charles Do you have an experience to share?

Today, more than 50% of the global population lives in cities; by 2050, that figure\u00a0will have risen to 75%.\u00a0 This mass migration to cities could result in crowded streets rife with air pollution,\u00a0traffic accidents and congestion. Or it could see a boom in clean, compact urban centres with safe, healthy communities. The way the world&apos;s cities operate in the future will be shaped by how they are designed and developed now. Many cities face major hurdles when it comes to traffic safety, air quality, and physical inactivity. As urban populations swell, these challenges will become all the more pressing. More than 90%\u00a0of\u00a0road traffic\u00a0deaths occur in middle- and low-income countries \u2013 precisely where urbanisation is accelerating most rapidly. About\u00a01.3 million people\u00a0die prematurely every year due to urban air pollution, a figure that will increase as more cars take to the road.\u00a0Already, 1.2 million people die and up to 50 million are injured\u00a0in\u00a0traffic accidents\u00a0annually. Nearly half of these incidents occur in cities. While cities face great challenges, they are also engines of economic growth. It is important city planners work to maintain that economic activity, even as they develop urban designs that are sustainable and good for public health. Smart urban planning can dramatically improve traffic safety, air quality, physical activity in the world&apos;s cities. It all starts with a vision: what kind of cities do we want to live in? How much time do we want to spend commuting, or with our families and friends, or pursuing our favourite activity? Do we want to accept traffic fatalities and injuries as the norm? How important is it for us to live in a healthy environment? For city dwellers, such issues can greatly impact quality of life. Some planners choose to expand the outer limits of a city as the population grows; the result is urban sprawl. In cities such as Mumbai, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, and Istanbul, many people are forced to travel considerable distances to go to work, obtain services, and generally go about their lives. The number of cars on the road goes up with urban sprawl, as does the risk of road accidents. Air pollution gets worse, and quality of life declines. However, forward-thinking planners can design compact cities that have a positive impact on human health. In areas with small blocks, vehicles make more frequent stops and typically travel at slower speeds. Cities with lower average car speeds and less complex intersections are safer for car passengers and pedestrians alike. Compact urban design can also encourage physical activity. Dense cities such as Amsterdam, New York, and Copenhagen offer residents more opportunities to cycle or walk. Because more trips can be made without a car, fewer vehicles are on the road. This reduces the risk of traffic\u00a0crashes\u00a0and decreases greenhouse gas emissions and other types of\u00a0air pollution. Finally, denser cities make high-quality public\u00a0transport\u00a0much more affordable to build. That is goods news from a public health perspective. Research from the World Resources Institute&apos;s Embarq Centre for Sustainable Transport has shown that well-designed mass transport systems are many times safer than private cars, the typical method of travel in a sprawling city. For example,\u00a0in Guadalajara, 99% of traffic accidents involve private vehicles (pdf). Only 1% of crashes occur along the Macrobus bus rapid transit (BRT) corridor. The magnitude of the challenges that cities face calls for new structural solutions. And some cities are making progress on that front. Embarq\u00a0is working with officials in more than 50 cities across six countries to redesign streets and public spaces, give people better options for getting around, and improve mass transit systems. In Mexico City, for example, Embarq has supported the construction of almost 620 miles of BRT corridors. These transit systems have cut commuting times by nearly 12m hours annually, reduced traffic-related injuries and fatalities by roughly 40%, and eliminated more than 113,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year. Many of today&apos;s booming cities are expanding, which is exacerbating urban challenges. But it need not be so. City planners must focus on smart design, public transport, and creating new opportunities for walking and cycling. Urban communities \u2013 and the environment \u2013 are depending on it.

By marrying one of the world&apos;s oldest organizing tools, the petition, to one of its newest, the social-media loop, Change.org is putting companies and governments under tremendous pressure to change their policies, sometimes in a matter of a few weeks or less, and it has invited everyone around the globe to participate.&quot; Jordan Raynor, co-founder, Citizinvestor     Jordan Raynor  Photograph: JR    Jordan Raynor is a co-founder of Citizinvestor - a crowdfunding and civic engagement platform for government projects.

But the models he had hired failed to show up, and a harsh, hot mistral was blowing, making conditions for painting outdoors unbearable. So he improvised: he took bunches of Proven\u00e7al sunflowers, then at their golden-blooming best, and arranged them in locally made, half-glazed earthenware pots. He started work on Monday morning and by Saturday he had made four sunflower pictures. Two of these are now among the most beloved, celebrated and valuable paintings in the world: they hang in Munich and in the National Gallery, London. Two are lost to public view \u2013 one was destroyed in an American bombing raid on Japan during the second world war, the other vanished into private hands after it was exhibited in Ohio in 1948. Now fresh details have emerged about the lost paintings. The Van Gogh expert Martin Bailey has tracked down a previously unknown 1920s print of Six Sunflowers \u2013 the work that was destroyed \u2013 so that for the first time since the war it can been seen in its original bright, vibrant colours, and with\u00a0a hitherto unseen original frame that Van Gogh painted to complement the colours of the subject. In addition, Bailey has tracked the &quot;missing&quot; painting, charting its progress through private hands after the war to being sold in the 1990s to a &quot;very discreet, private collector&quot; who owns a handful of Van Goghs. Bailey, who publishes his research this week in a new book, The Sunflowers Are Mine, found the 1920s image of Six Sunflowers in a small museum in Japan, tucked away in a portfolio of C\u00e9zanne\u00a0prints. One other, much poorer quality, reproduction exists, lacking the detail of the frame. It is also in much less vibrant colours than the print unearthed by Bailey, which matches the description that Van Gogh wrote of the work in a letter to his brother, Theo. The orange frame \u2013 bright where it follows the sky-blue background of the picture and paler where it meets the lilac of the table on which the flowers sit \u2013 was &quot;a revolutionary idea in 1888 when the work was painted,&quot; said Bailey. &quot;Paintings were normally hung in gilt frames, or for very modern works in white-painted frames \u2026 Van Gogh clearly meant it as an integral part of the\u00a0work.&quot; The painting met its doom on the same day that Hiroshima was destroyed, in a separate bombing attack on Ashiya. Long since removed from Van Gogh&apos;s painted frame, which he had had run up by the local carpenter in Arles, it was framed in elaborate gilt and hung above the sofa of a wealthy collector, Koyata Yamamoto. As fire engulfed the house, the large frame made the picture too heavy to rescue. Bailey has charted the lives of the four sunflower paintings, as well as the three copies Van Gogh made later of two of them, which now hang in museums in Philadelphia, Amsterdam and Tokyo. They began as pictures the artist made to decorate Paul Gauguin&apos;s bedroom, and could not sell, and ended up among the most revered and expensive paintings ever. Bailey believes that a sunflower painting would, if it reached the open market, make &quot;way beyond \u00a3100m&quot;. The National Gallery sold 26,000 postcards of its version last year. The paintings have remarkable histories. During the war Fifteen Sunflowers, the version that hangs in the National Gallery (it actually belongs to the Tate), was sent for safe keeping to Muncaster Castle in Cumbria, high above the old Roman port at Ravenglass. From there it was sent to the Trossachs to receive attention from a German picture conservator who had fled the Nazis. In his farmhouse north of Glasgow, the conservator replaced a gloomy Rembrandt on one wall with the cheerier sunflowers picture. Alongside was &quot;Van Gogh&apos;s Yellow Chair, a wonderful late Turner and Whistler&apos;s Waterloo Bridge, not a bad little collection to brighten up our wartime exile!&quot; he wrote. Wartime conditions meant he lacked proper tools, so when he relined the canvas of Fifteen Sunflowers he used a cheese grater to distribute wax on the back of the work, a domestic iron to spread it and a dentist&apos;s burnishing implement to smooth lifting paint on the front. &quot;They are methods that would horrify today&apos;s conservators,&quot; said Bailey, &quot;but the painting hasn&apos;t needed very much work since.&quot;", "sentences": ["Bailey has charted the lives of the four sunflower paintings, as well as the three copies Van Gogh made later of two of them, which now hang in museums in Philadelphia, Amsterdam and Tokyo."], "title": "Van Gogh expert sheds new light on lost sunflower paintings", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/04/van-gogh-lost-sunflower-paintings", "tags": ["Van Gogh", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-09-04T17:06:45Z", "article": "     Audi - &quot;Boxing Referee&quot; (Starts at 00:06) - UK Jonathan Glazer doesn&apos;t make many commercials these days as he concentrates on directing feature films instead, but in the same week as his latest movie - Under The Skin \u2013 wows audiences at the Venice Film Festival, his first advert in three years hit our TV screens.

I&apos;ve also swum where there were no changing rooms \u2013 it&apos;s the downside to &quot;wild&quot; swimming (or upside when you consider the state of some of them). I&apos;ve been around long enough to see &quot;progress&quot; that sometimes doesn&apos;t feel like that. And having once got changed out of a wetsuit in a minibus with nine other people I hardly knew after a swim in a glacial lake in freezing rain, you&apos;d imagine I&apos;d be loth to moan about basic facilities. You&apos;d be wrong. The signs pool management need to put up in changing rooms usually give you an idea of the kind of thing patrons would be up to, if they could. &quot;No spitting, no shaving&quot; has been my favourite to date (at Tooting Leisure Centre, for completists). If it hadn&apos;t been for that sign, I&apos;d have been hawking (yes, that word again, it means bringing up phlegm) and scything through my undergrowth with great enthusiasm. At a Virgin gym, I saw a &quot;No paparazzi!&quot; sign, again presumably because if you&apos;re a paparazzo, a sign would be enough to deter you from your mission. &quot;There&apos;s Jennifer Aniston in her scanties. Oh if it weren&apos;t for that sign \u2026 &quot; Being suggestible, the idea of checking out whether my fellow bathers were &quot;famous&quot; hadn&apos;t occurred to me until then; to be honest, Pippa Middleton could have been flossing her bits and I&apos;d have been hard pushed to care less. I once saw someone blow-drying their feet, but I&apos;m sure readers will have seen weirder. The worst changing rooms have a very particular smell, similar to the tigers&apos; enclosure in the zoo after a downpour, a feral urine/wet hay fusion. Then there are the mouldy showers with damp plastic curtains that glue to your skin. Clumps of matted black hair in the drains. You can almost see the veruccas lying in wait on the grubby beige tiled floors (or maybe those are bits of rice cake). Tiny graffitied cubicles that you can&apos;t sit down or turn around in. Puddles of lukewarm stagnant water of dubious provenance on the floor. Council posters featuring young people looking at you with haunted eyes. Ach, and lockers. Lockers are a particular annoyance. You pay 20p. You lock your stuff and go for a swim. You return to get your shower stuff. You open your locker and get your shower stuff. Then unless you put another 20p in, you have to leave it open while you shower. Or lockers with padlocks. &quot;Did you bring your own padlock?&quot; No, I tend not to carry such things about my person. So you get given a padlock, lock your glasses in your locker, then can&apos;t see to open the bloody thing again. Lockers are a minefield. It&apos;s not a shocking revelation to say you&apos;re more likely to find a decent changing room in a private gym. But that doesn&apos;t mean all private gyms have nice changing rooms. Sometimes they have extra little features that don&apos;t quite work \u2013 I went to one that had a mini-sauna in what I bet used to be a cupboard. I sat on a bench, knees pressed to the glass door, staring out at people, a tragic shop-window display. Like I was offering very niche services on an Amsterdam street. I was certainly hot. What private gyms don&apos;t tend to have are mixed changing rooms. That&apos;s a bit of &quot;progress&quot;that makes my heart sink \u2013 the changing village. If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a changing village full of children to drive an adult completely mad. Why do architects never ask swimmers (or more specifically, me) what they want? I understand the thinking behind them \u2013 there is always that time when small boys become slightly less small but not completely independent of their female carers, when to have them in a women&apos;s changing room seems odd. (When they&apos;re about 22, or so.) I do understand that it means people can take kids swimming and not have to rely on the kindness of strangers to help them dress. And hey, it&apos;s a beautiful thing, the family milling together in the changing village, Mummy here and Daddy right next door, not separated by some fascist gender-based rulez. But what about my rights to nudity? I just want to get naked in the shower. You can&apos;t have a proper wash if you keep your costume on, or a decent spit and shave. I realise nudity can cause embarrassment even in single-sex environs (most notably to my own child) but it&apos;s really not on in the changing village, apparently. Some people see &quot;no nudity&quot; as a bonus \u2013 young men, most notably. It seems to really get their goat, the thought of older gents in the buff. I&apos;ve had conversations with young men where they clearly, volubly express how the sight of a naked older man, tackle swinging gaily as a bellringer&apos;s rope, makes them want to pluck out their own eyes. I don&apos;t know what it is about the more pendulous older male genitals that&apos;s such a problem; I don&apos;t think that same visceral reaction applies in the women&apos;s changing rooms, but maybe if I asked some young women they&apos;d tell me how gross it is to see a pair of old boobs. My response would remain the same: get over it.

The news came as Vodafone&apos;s takeover battle for German broadband and television company Kabel Deutschland reached a nail biting finish, with fears the deal could fall at the final hurdle by failing to secure enough support from shareholders. In the US, Verizon attracted over 3,000 orders from more than 800 investors in a debt raising exercise that is set to eclipse the next three biggest corporate bond deals in history, including Apple&apos;s record $17bn issue this year. Verizon is expected to raise between $45bn to $49bn, more in debt than the gross domestic product of Tunisia, Slovenia, Lebanon and some 100 other countries. Demand was so high from dollar investors that a planned roadshow with meetings scheduled in Paris, London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam to attract sterling and euro investors was cancelled. The money raised will help fund Verizon&apos;s $130bn offer for Vodafone&apos;s 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, a joint venture between the two groups that has grown to become America&apos;s largest mobile phone network. Verizon&apos;s deal is bigger than the combined size of the next three largest corporate bond deals in history: the Apple trade and offerings from pharmaceutical groups Roche and Abbvie. Vodafone has said it will use the windfall from its US investment to improve the speed and coverage of its networks, investing in 4G technology, and in expanding its range of services. But a key deal in Vodafone&apos;s strategy of moving from mobile phones to selling more broadband and television services hangs in the balance. Its \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.5bn) offer for Kabel Deutschland will expire at midnight Frankfurt time on Wednesday unless at least 75% of the German group&apos;s shareholders accept the deal. Including shares already tendered, Vodafone held 19.88% of Kabel Deutschland&apos;s stock by mid afternoon on Tuesday 10 September, Vodafone said in a statement on Wednesday. That compares with close to 12% last Friday. &quot;There is a significant risk that we can&apos;t get 75%,&quot; said one analyst, who asked not to be named. &quot;Typically you would end up with a large wodge coming in the last day, but when you see a big gap and a significant other shareholder increasing their stake it makes you think it will be tougher to get that 75% hurdle.&quot; The hedge fund Elliott Capital Advisors doubled its stake in the German group to 10.9% last week. Hedge funds sometimes hold on to stock until after a deal is approved, demanding a higher price in order to be squeezed out at a later date when the buyer wants to take full control. Despite pressure from activist investors and major shareholders, who support the deal but fear it may fail, Vodafone said it would not lower the threshold for acceptances, or extend the deadline, or raise the price of its \u20ac84.50 per share offer.", "sentences": ["Demand was so high from dollar investors that a planned roadshow with meetings scheduled in Paris, London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam to attract sterling and euro investors was cancelled."], "title": "Verizon barters for $49bn bond sale record", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/11/verizon-cable-bond-sale-vodafone", "tags": ["Verizon Communications", "Telecommunications industry", "Business", "Vodafone", "US news", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-09-13T15:33:49Z", "article": "One of the panels on the Great Tapestry of Scotland, a stitched history of the nation that was unveiled last week in the Scottish parliament, is devoted to A Satire of the Three Estates, a morality play by David Lyndsay, which was first publicly performed in 1552. The caption boldly proclaims it to be &quot;the greatest Scottish play ever&quot;. I was startled by the confidence of this proclamation. The objection is not necessarily that obvious rival candidates immediately leap to mind; Macbeth, despite its superstitious theatrical nickname, is not strictly a &quot;Scottish play&quot;, but a play about Scotland written by an Englishman and therefore as ineligible for national top 10s as John Osborne&apos;s The Hotel in Amsterdam would be in a survey of Netherlands drama. My scepticism, however, was whether an entire theatrical tradition could be reduced to a single winning candidate. The temptation, though, is to play the game elsewhere, beginning in the rest of what more or less remains the UK. In England, it seems wilful and implausible to look beyond Shakespeare and the subsequent run-off between Hamlet and King Lear. The latter takes my vote because of its greater poetic and psychological density and the advantage, in a nationalistic exercise of this kind, of being one of only 12 of Shakespeare&apos;s plays to take place in England, due to his frequent reliance for sources on legends and stories from wider Europe. Although my choice is inevitably affected by a complete ignorance of Welsh-language drama, it seems to me that, at least with regard to scripts in English, Wales may have the unusual distinction that its greatest play is a radio drama: Dylan Thomas&apos;s Under Milk Wood (1954). Later adapted for stage, TV and film, the piece has certainly become the primary dramatic representation of Welsh speech and atmosphere \u2013 but I am happy to be corrected if this is simply a foreign perception. Another candidate of mine, Alun Owen&apos;s great TV play No Trams to Lime Street (1959), has the disadvantage of taking place not in Wales, but in Liverpool. It is in choosing an Irish representative, though, that the selection becomes most complex. Technically, She Stoops to Conquer (1773), The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) and Waiting for Godot (1953) all qualify to be among the greatest \u2013 certainly, the most influential \u2013 Irish plays on the basis of the birthplaces of Oliver Goldsmith, Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett. However, all emigrated, and Goldsmith&apos;s and Wilde&apos;s comedies take place in England while Beckett&apos;s play is located in limbo and was premiered in Paris in a French text. Another remarkable Irish drama \u2013 Seamus Heaney&apos;s The Cure at Troy (1991), his adaptation of Sophocles&apos; Philoctetes \u2013 is also disqualified by national confusion. If we follow the regulations set by A Satire of the Three Estates, King Lear and Under Milk Wood by choosing an example in which both writer and play represent the nation, the choice narrows. George Bernard Shaw, though he emigrated to England, did write one specifically Irish script, but John Bull&apos;s Other Island (1904) is weakened for our purposes by not being even the best play by Shaw, let alone all the writers from the island. Which leaves, for me, a shortlist of JM Synge&apos;s The Playboy of the Western World (1907), Sean O&apos;Casey&apos;s The Plough and the Stars (1926) and either Translations (1980) or Dancing at Lughnasa (1990) by Brian Friel. The O&apos;Casey and the earlier of the Friels have the ammunition of dealing with vital aspects of Irish history (the Easter Rising and the 19th-century land seizures), although recent revivals of Lughnasa have strongly made the case that this may be the play in which Irish writing most fully achieves its long dream of matching Chekhov. The O&apos;Casey play is probably the winner, especially if the other two parts of the writer&apos;s Dublin trilogy \u2013 The Shadow of a Gunman and Juno and the Paycock \u2013 are included. While this game is merely speculation \u2013 and my selections are intended to invite objection and contradiction \u2013 it&apos;s striking how, even in cultures with long theatrical histories, a shortlist is fairly easily compiled, although this may reflect the narrow range of texts that are regularly studied and performed. In American drama, for example, the debating candidates soon come down to a primary run-off between something by Eugene O&apos;Neill \u2013 probably Long Day&apos;s Journey into Night (1956), which brings the poignancy of having been posthumously premiered \u2013 and either Death of a Salesman (1949) or The Crucible (1953) by Arthur Miller. Edward Albee would also get some votes, with my own ballot favouring the undervalued A Delicate Balance (1966), which captures 20th-century American neuroses, rather than the more celebrated Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1962). A case could also be made for two nation-defining epics of modern US theatre, written from previously marginalised perspectives: Tony Kushner&apos;s Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes (1993) and August Wilson&apos;s The Pittsburgh Cycle (1982\u20132005). If contenders could enter 10 plays, the last would perhaps claim the prize, although this year&apos;s British revival of Fences, with Paulette Randall directing Lenny Henry, has provided further evidence \u2013 after a recent Denzel Washington revival on Broadway \u2013 that this single play from the cycle is fit to go into the ring with the established American classics.

Last\u00a0week the Football Association condemned the use of the word by fans, and this week it&apos;s been announced that the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters&apos; Trust is to poll members about the continued used of the chant. I welcome both these developments \u2013 although not as much as I welcome David Cameron weighing in on the other side of the argument by backing the right to chant: from a campaigning point of view, that&apos;s a dream come true. But the debate involves a number of misconceptions. Primary among these is the idea that it&apos;s all about Spurs. It isn&apos;t. Our film was sparked by the behaviour of a Chelsea fan who, sitting a few seats behind me and Ivor one Saturday, decided to upgrade the chant \u2013 regularly heard at Stamford Bridge whenever anything Spurs-related comes up \u2013 to a more pointed one of &quot;Fuck the fucking Yids! Fuck the fucking Jews!&quot;. The chant, and various antisemitic tropes which always grow out of it \u2013 involving hissing to represent gas and celebratory references to Auschwitz \u2013 exists far beyond White Hart Lane: at Chelsea, Arsenal, Millwall, West Ham, even at Ajax, in Amsterdam. However, there is of course a particular issue with Tottenham, some of whose fans passionately feel the Y-word is part of their identity and that their chanting of it is wholly positive. I\u00a0respect and acknowledge that. But here are the reasons why it is good that\u00a0this is being addressed. First, Spurs fans often tweet me, forcefully, to say that historically the chant was a response to antisemitic abuse levelled at them. That&apos;s as may be; but truly, it doesn&apos;t matter who started it. The fact is that whatever its origins, their continuing use of the Y-word legitimises and sustains the racist abuse aimed at Spurs by other fans. It&apos;s a call and response dynamic, like many at football matches. So the more Spurs do it, the more it comes back, with menaces. Many Chelsea fans who I have challenged feel they are justified because &quot;the Yids is what Spurs call themselves&quot;. Second, any campaign aimed at stopping the chanting of antisemitic abuse at football matches can&apos;t then say: &quot;But of course it&apos;s OK for this one set of fans because they mean it nicely.&quot; It&apos;s simply not workable. Third, most Spurs fans are not in fact Jewish: the club&apos;s &quot;Jewishness&quot; is just a historical association with the area. It&apos;s doubtful that more than 5% of those in the ground at home games are actual Jews (only 0.4% of the UK is Jewish, so 5% is way above average). So the reclamation argument does not apply, unless it&apos;s OK for a race-hate word to be reclaimed by people who do not own it. The equivalent case would be a club in Brixton made up mainly of white fans adopting the N-word as their &quot;badge of honour&quot;. This, I think, would be stopped fairly quickly. The last point is the key one. Let me say it again. Yid is a race-hate word. It was daubed across the East End by Oswald Moseley&apos;s Blackshirts, along with the word Out. The only possible reason why a culture that has tried to dismiss other race-hate words to the margins of language would consider it acceptable is if the racism of which it is a part is somehow less offensive, somehow less significant, than other racisms. Which must be, I guess, what a lot of people consciously or unconsciously think \u2013 if it had been the N-word or the P-word, it wouldn&apos;t have got past David Cameron&apos;s lips. This, at heart, is what this is about for me. It&apos;s not, in the end, to do with football, however much it was sparked by the miserable experience of 30 years sitting as a Jew in football grounds listening to huge groups of non-Jews bat an insulting word for my race back and forth in an endless slanging match. It&apos;s about trying to ensure that there is a level playing field around offensiveness. Ideally, I would be very uninterested in banning any words. But if the race-hate words used to denigrate black or Asian people are to be banned or considered unacceptable, then the same should apply for the vocabulary aimed at Jews. Because the truth is, up till now, that vocabulary has not been considered equivalently offensive. A friend of mine \u2013 a Watford fan who heard his fellow fans chanting the Y-word aggressively at Spurs fans once \u2013 was told, on complaining to a steward: &quot;I don&apos;t hear any racism.&quot; This is all our campaign has been trying to do: make the racism heard, above the chanting.", "sentences": ["The chant, and various antisemitic tropes which always grow out of it \u2013 involving hissing to represent gas and celebratory references to Auschwitz \u2013 exists far beyond White Hart Lane: at Chelsea, Arsenal, Millwall, West Ham, even at Ajax, in Amsterdam."], "title": "Yes, David Cameron, 'Yid' really is a race-hate word.

Hundreds of thousands of dogs, cats, guinea pigs, tropical fish, parrots, rabbits and even the odd rat have passed through the Airpets handling and quarantine centre since its founder converted it from a pig farm 47 years ago. &quot;But we try to put [customers] off hamsters,&quot; says Lacey. Her colleagues break out into giggles. &quot;They don&apos;t make it,&quot; she adds. &quot;They don&apos;t live very long, little hamsters. The flight coming over, then the [four-month] quarantine. The average lifespan is, what, a couple of years? I wouldn&apos;t pay all that money for a hamster, no I don&apos;t think so.&quot; And it is a lot of money. Flying in a hamster from New York plus the legally enforced four-month stay in the quarantine cages would cost at least \u00a32,000. The cost of sending a pet overseas depends on the animal&apos;s size, but Nick Foden-Ellis, Airpets managing director, says it is &quot;rarely less than a business-class ticket for the same route&quot;. A recent job sending a chocolate labrador to Sydney cost more than \u00a34,000. Despite the economic downturn business has been booming for Airpets and the dozens of other pet importing and exporting firms. &quot;We&apos;ve had the busiest summer for 10 years,&quot; says Foden-Ellis. The firm has recorded a recent rise in pet exports to Australia after its currency fell against the pound, he says. The pound has recovered to A$1.71 from A$1.44 in March. &quot;The exchange rate change adds a huge amount to disposable income. People that might not have been able to afford to take their pets with them and might have left them behind with a relative now feel they can afford to take them with them.&quot; He says exports to Australia \u2013 the most expensive destination as it requires a stopover \u2013 are up 8%-10%. Australia is Airpets&apos; biggest export destination accounting for 40% of all pet travel. &quot;Everyone has been watching [ITV show] Poms in Paradise,&quot; he says. Official figures from the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency show 139,000 dogs were brought into the UK last year compared with 85,000 in 2011. Imports of cats jumped 74% to more than 14,000. Even ferrets, popularised in recent years by Paris Hilton and Jonathan Ross rose from 68 in 2011 to 93 in 2012. The agency, part of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, also reports a big rise in families importing rabbits, chinchillas, rats, guinea pigs, fish, snakes and even frogs. It says imports of cats and dogs to the UK exploded on 1 January last year when the pet passport scheme made it much easier for people to move pets from the European Union and certain other countries to the UK. &quot;Overnight, it meant the end of mandatory quarantine for thousands of animals that had rabies jabs and vet certificates,&quot; says Foden-Ellis. &quot;We opened at midnight on New Year&apos;s Day as some of our animals were eligible to leave without seeing out the rest of their sentence. Four or five people came in to collect their pets, we had some champagne.&quot; While it is now much easier to bring in animals, it still requires planning with vaccinations for rabies and check-ups several weeks in advance. &quot;People don&apos;t think about how tricky it can be,&quot; says Foden-Ellis, a former paratrooper. &quot;An awful lot of our customers are people who go on holiday to north Africa, Cyprus or Spain and fall in love with a street dog and want to bring it home with them. They&apos;ll manage to get it on a flight back from Spain or wherever, but when they arrive here they&apos;ll be asked for documentation. &apos;Well, I haven&apos;t got it,&apos; they&apos;ll say. That means it will have to go into quarantine, which can cost \u00a31,500-\u00a32,000.&quot; Sadly, he says, when some people find out the size of the bill they fall out of love. &quot;We will never destroy an animal. That&apos;s why if you check out these guys&apos; staff profiles you&apos;ll see how many pets they&apos;ve got. They&apos;re predominately strays that people haven&apos;t been able to afford the quarantine bill for.&quot; While the number of strays Airpets handles is rising, they are a tiny proportion compared with the pets which executives take when posted abroad. &quot;There has been a huge rise in pets going out to Asia and Bric [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries,&quot; he says. &quot;As those economies grow businesses are sending their people there, and animals are becoming more accepted as family pets in Asia.&quot; Laura Nolan, an Airpets customer who took her cat, Gizmo, from Plymouth to Sydney, says the trip cost up to \u00a316,000 including her own flight and visas. &quot;We had her since she was a kitten and we both agreed that we wouldn&apos;t have been able to leave her behind and not know what happened to her.&quot; Despite the cost, Nolan adds, she will take Gizmo with her if she ever has to move again. Foden-Ellis also boasts a string of celebrity customers, some of whom even fly out their pets with them on holiday. &quot;We have movie stars, footballers, everyone,&quot; he says. One of the world&apos;s best-known footballers regularly books his dogs on transatlantic flights, he lets slip, before threatening to hunt me down if the Guardian names him. Mike Sawyer, sales and development manager of rival pet transporters JCS Livestock, says his firm has also recorded an increase in business. &quot;We have got a couple of people who take their pets on holiday with them; one customer takes his dogs to New York back and forth at least twice a year and another client sends his dogs to Australia and back,&quot; he says. &quot;Another client shipped their dog to America for a two-week holiday. Luckily it was a small dog \u2013 you pay by the size.&quot; Sawyer points out that the airlines make much more than the handlers. Ram\u00f3n Delima, vice-president of special cargo at Air France-KLM, which claims to transport more animals than any other airline, says animal transport does not follow socioeconomic trends because pets are largely seen &quot;as part of the family&quot;. He refuses to say how much money KLM makes from transporting animals, but it&apos;s a much higher margin than regular cargo. &quot;It&apos;s not as simple as transporting a box. We have an animal hotel in Schiphol [airport near Amsterdam]. We take full care of them \u2026 dogs are walked in the park, literally. We have animal attendants, just like cabin attendants for passengers.

In June, Haim played Glastonbury to acclaim \u2013 three times, once on the Park stage, twice on the Pyramid stage, the second time as guests of Bobby Gillespie and Primal Scream. In July, the Twitter-steering website Buzzfeed declared their boisterous single The Wire &quot;the best rock song of the summer&quot;. In August, their debut album Days Are Gone still some weeks off, the New Yorker marvelled at Haim becoming &quot;everyone&apos;s favourite band in America&quot;. Personally, I&apos;d have called up that last one for a few hundred rereads. But Haim, in Amsterdam, with time on their hands, chose to immerse themselves in fiction. &quot;Fan fiction,&quot; Este explained. &quot;There are chapters and chapters of it!&quot; said Alana. &quot;There&apos;s a whole subculture of this stuff.&quot; Much of it was about the boy band One Direction, though Haim had recently earned an ongoing serial of their own. In the last instalment, things had become steamy between Alana and One Direction&apos;s Liam; now everyone anxiously awaited the results of a pregnancy test. &quot;When we found this on Facebook,&quot; said Este, &quot;it was like, Hanukkah.&quot; Habitually dressed in leather and lace, these Jewish Californians play irresistible guitar music with Danielle, the dark-browed middle sibling, in the lead as chief guitarist and vocalist. She studs her lyrics with percussive &quot;Hahs!&quot; and &quot;Huhs!&quot;, layering in rhythm where there&apos;d normally be just melody (&quot;Rhythm is the foundation of everything we do&quot;).

Their sound has not quite united critics \u2013 was this &quot;west coast rock layered with R&amp;B&quot; or a &quot;winning update of 80s US mainstream pop&quot;? \u2013 but it was liked enough for Haim to be named the BBC&apos;s Sound of 2013 in January. Industry peers have put up noisy support, too, the Arctic Monkeys mooting a collaboration, the xx, Florence Welch, Katy Perry and Ryan Adams announcing themselves fans. &quot;I&apos;m like the fourth Haim sister,&quot; said Angel Haze, the Detroit rapper. &quot;Honorary Jew shit.&quot; Pondering all this encouragement, Alana said: &quot;We&apos;re just happy they know how to pronounce our name.&quot; People tend to say Hame, which is wrong, or Hime, which will do. The girls say it the proper Israeli way (their father is from Jaffa) with a second-syllable hop at the end, High-im. It&apos;s the\u00a0Hebrew word for life, which came to feel appropriate as I spent the day with them. The Haims sang, swore, told stories incessantly, Danielle and Alana in slow, so-Cal drawls, Este at greater speed and volume. &quot;I think I have undiagnosed ADHD,&quot; said Este, who at one point got noisily stuck in a toilet; who impulsively invited me, within a minute of first hellos, to join the band (&quot;We have bongos. Don&apos;t we have bongos?&quot;); and who had had a cunning riff she&apos;d prepared, meant to lead me astray, about a supposed weed habit. &quot;It&apos;s Amsterdam so of course I have my bong. It goes everywhere with me. It&apos;s the only way I can play a show\u2026 &quot; While I scribbled this down she pulled a porcelain jug out of her bag, a water bong meant to ease sore throats. &quot;I pass on grass, bro. As a diabetic, I can&apos;t. It gives you the munchies.&quot; Este&apos;s diabetes might have ruined Glastonbury for Haim. As Este tells it, she almost died in front of a crowd of 35,000. Alana: &quot;You didn&apos;t almost die.&quot; But she did forget to snack, &quot;and by the third-to-last song I couldn&apos;t feel my arms. My eyes were rolling back in to my head.&quot; Este fled the stage, Danielle vamping chords to cover it (&quot;I thought it was a wardrobe malfunction&quot;) while her sister took in fistfuls of wine gums. When she returned, she had to play sitting down, &quot;like BB King&quot;. So eat, Este&apos;s sisters kept telling her in Amsterdam, eat! It was one of many potential hurdles to navigate as we whiled away the hours before their show. They told me they were allergic to bees, a constant threat as we walked beside the canals and bike paths. They had interviews to do with Dutch journalists, one of whom, unlucky dude, asked Este about being a female bassist. Her rebuke began: &quot;The fact that that is even a question in 2013\u2026&quot; and the journalist was still apologising a while later. Afterwards, the Haims, dutiful daughters, had to call their parents.            Sound check at the venue was delayed and then delayed again, poor Dash twiddling his thumbs at his drum kit while the sisters phoned home. Their mother, Donna, cried (she\u00a0missed them), and Alana cried (she was\u00a0bunged up with flu). At the same time, Danielle and Este were instructed not to leave Holland without\u00a0checking out Amsterdam&apos;s novelty museum, the Heineken Experience. Este: &quot;Last time my mom was here was in the 70s. She won&apos;t remember to buy me, like, insulin for my diabetes, but she&apos;ll remember the Heineken Experience.&quot; Their parents, Donna and Moti Haim, raised the sisters in a suburb of LA called Studio City. In her youth Donna sang and played guitar in coffee shops. Moti, who&apos;d moved from Israel to California to play semi-professional football, was a keen drummer. Once Alana was old enough to hold up a cowbell the family formed a covers band. &quot;Our dad would be like, &apos;Do you have homework? OK then, let&apos;s go jam in the living room.&apos;&quot; Donna sang and Moti drummed. Alana graduated up the percussion tree and then to piano. Danielle was the lead guitarist and Este \u2013 struggling to keep up with her younger sister in their guitar lessons \u2013 was persuaded to switch to the bass. &quot;My dad showed me a video of Tina Weymouth playing bass in Talking Heads. I thought she was pretty, so I agreed.&quot; They called themselves Rockenhaim. It was an idea,\u00a0the girls insist, that came to Moti in a dream. Some kudos, here, should go to the youth of Studio City, because the Haims\u00a0weren&apos;t teased or bullied about any of this. Danielle: &quot;I always thought\u00a0it\u00a0was cool that we were in a band with our parents.&quot; Este: &quot;Everyone\u00a0at school\u00a0was super supportive. It was something different, I guess.&quot; After one show in their local neighbourhood, Este and Danielle were invited to be a part of a pop quintet called the Valli Girls. Brightly clothed, dead-eyed, they hadn&apos;t a hope. One of their early songs was called It&apos;s a Hair Thing and featured the lyric &quot;Grab your cell phone /Get your laptop /We&apos;re going out to have fun /And shop&quot;. Este: &quot;It wasn&apos;t necessarily the music we wanted to be making.&quot; Danielle: &quot;You live and learn.&quot; Around 2007, Rockenhaim slimmed their line-up to sisters only, their name to Haim, added Dash on drums, and played a first show for about 80 people. This would be Haim&apos;s best-attended gig for a while. The sisters got used to playing around LA to crowds of 20, 10, three. &quot;In general,&quot; Moti once said, &quot;we had to beg people to come.&quot; Este was studying for a music degree, in 2009, when Danielle was asked to play backing guitar for the singer-songwriter Jenny Lewis. At a New York gig with Lewis, she was spotted by the Strokes&apos; founder Julian Casablancas, then looking to staff a band for his solo work. Danielle called her sister at college. Este: &quot;I dropped the phone. I was like: &apos;Fuuuck this. My sister&apos;s going on tour with Julian Casablancas? Why am I here studying?&apos; That really lit a fire up my ass, to make Haim happen.&quot; Este was chairing her university&apos;s events committee at the time. &quot;Trying to settle on a figure that didn&apos;t look too shady&quot;, she booked Haim to play on campus. &quot;We got $1,000. So thank you very much, Este Haim.&quot; They spent the money following Casablancas on tour \u2013 all of them, Danielle, Este, Alana, even Moti, who drove. Every night, before Danielle played in Casablancas&apos;s band, Haim opened the show.            The former Stroke gave them advice. &quot;Julian told us: disappear, come back in a year with stronger songs and hit the ground running.&quot; By the time Alana had finished high school the sisters had a new manager, Jon Lieberberg, and a producer, Ludwig G\u00f6ransson. They put some early tracks online in February 2012, including the thrilling, twitchy break-up song Forever. A month later, gigging at South by South West in Texas, they caught the ear of a British DJ, Mary Anne Hobbs, then with Xfm. Hobbs played their stuff. Soon, Radio 1 did too. Hobbs explained Haim&apos;s appeal to me: &quot;Infectious melodies, hard-hitting hooks, choruses you could bawl. And they felt like a real gang.&quot; Polydor signed Haim that summer and they got an American deal with Columbia six months later. By then, the xx had been in touch, asking the sisters to support them when they played in LA. I happened to interview the British band before the show and watched the xx&apos;s Oliver Sim break the heel off his shoe in his rush not to miss Haim&apos;s set. A few weeks later, I sat with Mumford and Sons backstage at a gig where they watched Haim&apos;s single, Don&apos;t Save Me, on YouTube. It was agreed in the room that this was pretty much the perfect pop song. In Amsterdam this was something the band, who between 2007 and 2012 sometimes outnumbered their own audience, were still getting used to: fans. The first person in the queue for the show was an earnest-looking young Belgian whom the sisters recognised because he&apos;d been tearing around Europe in the wake of their tour bus, watching four Haim gigs in five days. &quot;They stole my heart,&quot; he told me, and when Haim&apos;s show got under way he stood front and centre, belly against the stage, doggedly eyeballing Danielle. I gathered she was his favourite. Earlier, when they were reading the fan fiction, I&apos;d asked: who was the hero? Which sister came off best? And Este replied immediately: &quot;Danielle. As usual.&quot; The middle Haim, apparently, was the charmed one \u2013 the most accomplished guitarist, the one who could do power chords and solos before she was 12, the one asked to tour the world with Julian Casablancas. I looked out for signs of bitterness about this, some sort of sisterly discord, and unearthed precisely one instance. Este, at a young age, cut off all of Danielle&apos;s hair. Afterwards, in a fit of self-rebuke, Este took off her own eyelashes too. This early fiasco seemed the extent of any rivalry. At one point, I watched Este and Danielle inspect the insides of Alana&apos;s nose, at length, for visible snot. &quot;We&apos;ve always been close,&quot; they told me. Just the tiniest of squabbles. &quot;Your purse? I didn&apos;t take your purse. No, wait, I took it last night. I took it.&quot; Otherwise, it was all in-jokes and near-telepathic sentence completion. As Mary Anne Hobbs put it: &quot;They&apos;re like sisters you&apos;d want in your own family.&quot; Haim&apos;s set in Amsterdam ended with an extraordinary expression of sisterhood, a carefully synchronised few minutes of percussion in which each of the Haims took up sticks and played a bit of pulled-apart drum kit. Este rolled and rim-shotted a pair of timbales. Alana battered a floor tom. Danielle thudded out a bass beat, somehow keeping her guitar baying at the same time. They worked the Dutch crowd into a frenzy and left the stage to roars. The tour was over. In Haim&apos;s dressing room, a new instalment of the fan fiction awaited. Alana wasn&apos;t pregnant!

Velpent called for government restrictions on sugar in food and a ban on soft drinks in schools. So are Mars bars the new cigarettes? An anti-sugar movement is emerging. Endocrinologist Dr Robert Lustig&apos;s lecture, Sugar: The Bitter Truth, has picked up four million views on YouTube. The latest National Diet and Nutrition survey shows all age groups exceeded the recommended 11% of energy coming from sugars added to foods. For children aged between 11\u00a0and\u00a018 the mean intake was 15.3%. Since the survey is self-reported it is likely that most people underestimate their intake. The solution Why are we eating more? We like sugar and manufacturers have made some foods sweeter. An analysis found that Hovis wholemeal bread had doubled in sugar content between 1978 and 2013. A\u00a0meta-analysis paper (that combines the results of studies) published this year found that increased intake of sugar led to weight gain. It also showed that children who had one sugary drink a day were 55% more likely to be overweight than those who did not. An accompanying editorial argued that sugar interferes with metabolic processes that protect against diabetes and heart attacks. Another study found that replacing 5% of calories from saturated fat with calories from sugars or other high-glycaemic-index carbohydrates increased the rate of heart attacks by 33%. A Princeton University Review study\u00a0found that rats experienced changes to the dopamine and opioid receptors in their brains after being flooded with sugar. This made them sugar-dependent. The authors queried whether adults could also develop a dependency. Whatever the conculsion, it is worth cutting down on sugar. Be aware of how much your food contains. Fat-free products often have high sugar levels to make them palatable, so try to avoid them. More sleep will also make you less likely to crave sugar. Recommended limits are 50g a day in a 2,000-calorie diet. A\u00a0teaspoon is 4g.

With a menu built from salatim (cold vegetable dishes, mostly) and hummus, mezze plates and kebabs, Zahav is deceptively simple in some ways; but the menu also contains dishes like grilled duck hearts and crispy haloumi with golden raisins and carrots.

We are Tim and Tom. We&apos;re both from the UK, but Tom has been living in Amsterdam for the past 14 years. We originally met on Soundcloud when working on solo projects. Collaborating produced some funky stuff and we became really good friends. We knew we had found each other&apos;s Simon and Garfunkel. Describe your music-making process Since we&apos;re both in different countries we have to send and share our projects with each other. We&apos;ve used Dropbox to share all of our projects for such a long time now that we couldn&apos;t work without it! In terms of writing the music we both play integral parts in this process. Typically one of us will start the initial idea, whether its a chord sequence, a drum pattern or a bass line, and then we will send it over to the other person who will add / chop and change it. As the projects grow it becomes a massive collaborative process and we have so much fun doing it. We tend to write lots of songs, but only a select few get to see the light of day. If our feet start tapping whilst working on it, then thats the sure sign that the song will be put in the &apos;good&apos; pile.       What does disco mean to you? Melody and harmony play a huge part in our music. We love playing around with live instruments such as guitars and old synths and disco happens to be full of all that good stuff! Disco is like black coffee and fried chicken. Its not all about the flares and the massive gold chains. Its music which you can&apos;t help but dance to. Music that to the vast majority of people is timeless. If its funky everyone can feel something in that type of music. What are your thoughts on the current state of dance music? Well a couple of weeks ago, Swedish duo Daleri made a mash-up out of the main hooks from the top 10 Beatport dance chart. Needless to say, the mash-up sounded like one long song. In terms of mainstream dance music, we&apos;re not big fans and the majority of tracks that get played in festivals by charting DJs all sound the same. There are two sides to the coin when it comes to commercial dance music. On the one side you have music which is written and produced by DJs and producers who are still very much still in creative control of their music, and on the other you have more commercially accessible music which is built upon the framework of modern pop music. The music David Guetta produces is quite simple and nothing that a bedroom producer couldn&apos;t write after a year on a PC using FL Studio. However, every song he writes has a vocal hook in it driven by a commercially successful pop singer that helps carry the song along.\u00a0 Some of the songs we play in our DJ set are by artists that you may not have heard of \u2013 Eumig and Chinon, Futurecop, Tobtok, Robotaki, Majestique \u2013 these guys excel at their ability to write great music, yet are nowhere near as succesful as the popular names in commercial dance music who knock out the same tired sounding crowd pleasers.       Who would you class as your musical peers? Thats a tough question. We often see other musicians and producers and think to ourselves &apos;why can&apos;t we sound as good as them?&apos; Tobtok and Oliver Nelson are great producers, although we consider these guys to have a more solid and refined sound than us, so it&apos;s great to know that equally they love our music just as much as we enjoy theirs! Thats not to say that we don&apos;t sometimes think &apos;You bastards!&apos; for having written such a great hook. It&apos;s not a competition by any means, but if they write good music, it keeps us on our toes. We know we have to deliver something great!

The author of the book Bonus, about his time in that bank, Wawoe is currently an HR consultant for banks and a lecturer in human resources at the Free University in Amsterdam. &quot;People ask, when will bankers have enough? But it&apos;s not about the money. It&apos;s a highly addictive status game. Pay marks your status in the organisation. This is why there is no saturation point. &quot;I remember giving a \u20ac2m bonus to a banker. It was mostly in options but still. His first question: &apos;How much is my co-worker getting?&apos;. The status game is played on many levels: do you have your own car park? If so, how close to the entrance? What car do you drive? If it&apos;s provided by the employer, what&apos;s the model? Audi has a series, 4,6,8 \u2026 I have seen bankers pass around photos of their car, of the upholstery, of the sound system. Having your own driver is a crucial status marker. Some will leave their car with their driver waiting outside, or use their car for very small distances, simply in order to be seen as having a driver. &quot;Then there&apos;s the flying. I have flown business class and it does something to you. Over there is a long line of sweaty people and you are walking past all that, with your platinum card. Have you noticed that people in business class are far more likely to look at passengers making their way to economy class? They want to be seen sitting in business class. I never catch people in the first rows of economy class doing that. &quot;Watches send important signals, and so do suits. Bankers are able to read each other&apos;s shoes, see if they are of the \u00a3500-\u00a31,000 a piece variety. Pin stripes, a pochet (breast pocket handkerchief), handmade shirts with your initials sewn in, to signal they are bespoke. &quot;Let me tell you what I believe is the biggest problem in banking. No banker will ever admit this because that would undermine their deepest sense of self. The biggest problem in banking is measuring performance. &quot;Professional tennis players operate on a level playing field with their opponents, using the same surface and balls, the same wind speed. Their performance can be measured. But now you are the CEO at a major British bank. Tomorrow the pound crashes and your bank has the worst year in history. That is far beyond your control. I am not saying CEOs or bankers are clueless gamblers in a casino. On the contrary, you need skills to be a good banker, absolutely. What I&apos;m saying is that finance is simply too complex, with too many unknown unknowns and too many crucial factors beyond an individual banker&apos;s control, to adequately measure their yearly performance. &quot;Many in investment banking will tell you they work in a meritocratic environment. And yes, you can often attach a number to their activities. But that&apos;s not the same. I am having mint tea right now in this restaurant. That mint tea I can measure because a few years from now this mint tea is not going to turn out to have been something else entirely. &quot;Take professional cycling. For years Lance Armstrong was feted as the greatest cyclist of all times. His performance looked great until new information emerged. Now he is universally despised. Take Barclays&apos; former CEO Bob Diamond. He was very close to a takeover of ABN Amro. I remember how he came over to tell us, literally, &apos;I&apos;m gonna make you rich&apos;. In the end it was Fred Goodwin at RBS who, with Santander and Fortis, bought ABN Amro. This was a disaster because ABN Amro was a mess. Since Diamond had failed to close the deal, he escaped and went on to be considered for many years London&apos;s top investment banker. Until some of his traders turned out to have been rigging Libor. &quot;How do you measure Diamond&apos;s performance? Or that of then ABN Amro&apos;s CEO Rijkman Groenink? Certain complex financial instruments may look great for many years, suddenly explode and take down your bank. How do you measure the performance of those who built, bought or sold those instruments? &quot;Why will no banker ever be able to admit that performance cannot be measured adequately? Because those performance numbers inform the system of &apos;variable compensation&apos; or bonuses, and that&apos;s how they keep score! &quot;Incidentally, this is how I have come to define the glass ceiling. It&apos;s the point in the hierarchy of an organisation where performance becomes essentially impossible to measure and other factors become decisive. Whether you&apos;re a &apos;fit&apos;, if you know the etiquette at a networking event, play golf, know how to talk about the news in the right way \u2026 Many women don&apos;t get that, and try to work twice as hard. This means they miss out on the very social events that determine their career prospects. &quot;Many investment banking teams are essentially groups of friends forever travelling the world. Primarily, they&apos;ll try to hire somebody they can spend all that time with. &quot;Management often focus on the wrong side of the equation. To increase performance you don&apos;t need bonuses, you need better training. I have worked with quite a few bankers who did not understand the products they were selling. That was the problem, not motivation. If you incentivise them to sell those products, it&apos;s even dangerous. &quot;Bonuses work for simple work such as stacking items in a supermarket. If everything depends on people&apos;s willingness to work, then variable rewards do encourage them to work harder. But when the skill is very hard or impossible to measure, then bonuses are prone to lead to undesirable behaviour. Especially in banks where liability is often zero, because profits go to the banker but losses to the shareholder or taxpayer. &quot;Banking is a game and bonuses are the prize, like medals for athletes. Bankers want to compete, and will continue to do so even after we alter the playing field, for instance by drastically cutting or even abolishing their bonuses. Why don&apos;t managers focus more on this? Well, for one thing, management in banking is a disaster. Of course it is. What makes you effective as a trader, asset manager or dealmaker doesn&apos;t automatically make you a good manager. And it is from those ranks that the top management is recruited. &quot;Retail banking has the best management. The reason is that most managers there have worked their way up while working with relatively transparent products. The simpler the product, the better the management. As operations becomes more complex and opaque and performance becomes harder to measure, the quality of management decreases. You see that in banks and you see it at universities, hospitals \u2026 And, as they say, a fish rots from the head. &quot;I have seen people change after a bonus, seen them become unhappy. Suddenly their benchmark changed, they began to compare themselves to a whole different set of people. Parents know how this works. Imagine I give only one of my children a chocolate. Of course the other will start crying \u2026 Now I don&apos;t give any chocolates to anyone. Everyone is happy. &quot;When I started out at the bank I did not get a bonus, nor expected one. In later years I got a \u20ac1,000, which I really enjoyed. It felt like a little extra. A few years later I went to work for the bank in Monaco, where they promised me a \u20ac5,000 bonus when I did well. At the end of my assignment I got \u20ac30,000 and you know what? I felt cheated. This is what a bonus does to you. I have seen it happen to so many bankers. &quot;A lot of the blame of what is going wrong in the world today can be laid at the door of bonuses, and the system of targets underpinning them. I am in my early 40s. In secondary school in the 80s we would read about the Soviet Union. I can&apos;t help thinking how the target culture is reminiscent of a plan economy, somehow trying to force reality into conforming to the centrally agreed-upon numbers. &quot;Back to status. I like asking my students where they think they are on the global wealth spectrum. All the way on one side is Bill Gates, and then 7 billion people all the way to the other extreme: a beggar in India. Most Dutch students think they are among the 60% wealthiest people. The reality is, an average Dutch student belongs to the 9% richest people on Earth. But this is not how they see themselves and it&apos;s not what the mass media tell them. &quot;Try telling yourself every morning as you get up: wow, I belong to the richest people on Earth. Very few people can do this. Same with bankers. They live in their own world, and they look at what their peers have. &quot;Same with a bank&apos;s CEO. At least he should have been happy and content, right? He was sitting at the very top of his monkey&apos;s rock, as we call it in Dutch. But he wasn&apos;t happy because he was no longer comparing himself to his colleagues on his own rock. His sights were now set on other even bigger rocks in the distance. So he wanted his bank to grow, become as formidable as those others. &quot;So there&apos;s that, and simultaneously this CEO also finds himself under immense pressure. When fund managers at, say, pension funds have to decide which banking shares to buy, they will compare the returns promised by different banks, and they will compare banking as a whole with other sectors in the economy. So if you are a bank&apos;s CEO and you want your share price to go up, you need to promise high returns. How does a bank do that? One way is to cut your own pay. Another is to take more risk, or work the sales force. &quot;As long as the targets and bonus culture persists, I find it hard to blame bankers for being &apos;immoral&apos;. What is moral behaviour? Obeying the rules and doing as you&apos;re told? In society that&apos;s what makes an upright citizen, isn&apos;t it? Someone who keeps to the law. But in banking the rules say: hit your targets. Sell this CDO [collateralised debt obligation] even if you don&apos;t want to. Go along with what was agreed upon. &quot;So when we tell bankers to be moral, we want them to be moral in a different meaning of the word \u2013 to think for themselves, use their own moral compass and go against the system they find themselves in. That is a very difficult thing to do for people, go against an entire system. &quot;In a bank that ranks all sales people, the one who sells 60 mortgage insurances is better than the one who sold 20, even if the former sold those 60 to people who didn&apos;t need that mortgage insurance in the first place, or had no idea what they were buying. The system pushes people to disregard their conscience and take a purely rules-based perspective on morality: did I break any laws? No, in that case I am OK. What&apos;s more, I&apos;ll be rewarded and celebrated. &quot;On a lighter note, then. What kind of animal is the HR officer? Well, we exist to help others excel. Is there an animal that lets another animals do that? If the alpha male chimpanzee is the leader of the pack, I would say we are the beta-male chimpanzees: there to make others achieve their goals. &quot;HR know everything, all the shit happening in the bank, from fraud to drinking problems to who&apos;s getting what in the next bonus round, to who&apos;s in line to get made redundant \u2026 What makes HR people powerful in a bank is that they have regular access to the top people. In that sense we are somewhat like ladies-in-waiting, a conduit to the powerful.&quot; \u2022 To comment on this interview, please visit the accompanying blogpost", "sentences": ["The author of the book Bonus, about his time in that bank, Wawoe is currently an HR consultant for banks and a lecturer in human resources at the Free University in Amsterdam."], "title": "Former HR head at ABN Amro: 'We are beta-male chimpanzees' | Joris Luyendijk", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2013/sep/25/hr-abn-amro-beta-male-chimpanzees", "tags": ["Banking", "Business", "Financial sector", "Money", "Work & careers", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-09-26T07:18:00Z", "article": "We may have got James Bond slightly wrong. Yes, he is a prodigious drinker, heavy smoker and consummate killer, but when it comes to his womanising, the author of his new incarnation believes that the spy was more honourable than some think. &quot;It seems to me he wants a relationship,&quot; said William Boyd. &quot;It is not just casual sex.&quot; Boyd was speaking at the launch of his new Bond book, Solo, at which he was asked who his favourite Bond girl was. &quot;I&apos;m not too keen on the expression &apos;Bond girl&apos; because I think Bond has relationships with women,&quot; he said. Having said that, he named the character Honeychile Rider \u2013 &quot;nothing to do with Ursula Andress playing her in the movie \u2026 I think she is a very interesting Bond woman&quot;. Boyd should know, having reread every Bond novel to the point where he now has a Mastermind-level knowledge of the them. It was all preparation for Solo, published on Thursday, in which Boyd joins Kingsley Amis, Sebastian Faulks and Jeffery Deaver in succeeding the 14 Bond novels written by Ian Fleming, who died in 1964. Lucy Fleming, the writer&apos;s niece, said her uncle described himself in Who&apos;s Who as simply the author of several books of suspense. &quot;He must be looking down, or possibly up, at us in amazement and have a big grin on his face.&quot;     William Boyd holding his new James Bond novel Solo in front of a Jenson car outside the Dorchester hotel in London.  Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA    Solo was launched at the Dorchester in London as a nod to Boyd&apos;s Bond, who early on celebrates his 45th birthday in the hotel. In the book, Bond has dinner alone \u2013 pan-fried Scottish scallops with a beure blanc sauce accompanied by a bottle of Taittinger Rose 1960 followed by fillet of beef, rare, with pommes dauphinoise and a bottle of Ch\u00e2teau Batailley 1959. Across the room, he spots a beautiful woman. The book then charts a Bond &quot;recklessly motivated by revenge&quot; and sees him travel to the war-ravaged west African nation of Zanzarim, to stop a civil war, and Washington where he discovers a web of geopolitical intrigue. Boyd, author of novels including Any Human Heart and Restless, said he had been given &quot;no instructions, no remit&quot; by the Fleming estate or the publisher. But he added: &quot;It is my invention, but you&apos;d be a fool not to nod to certain aspects of the Bond novels we love.&quot; M is there, as is a &quot;rather frosty exchange with Moneypenny&quot; and Bond&apos;s CIA friend Felix Leiter. There are weapons, cars, snappy clothes and &quot;a lot of eating and drinking&quot;. But Boyd said he had included some very personal touches in the novel, including his methods for the perfect vinaigrette and the perfect vodka martini. Boyd admitted he had experience of the heavy drinking culture that Bond inhabits, because of his upbringing in Africa: &quot;My father, who was a doctor for heaven&apos;s sake, would come home from his clinic and have two very large pink gins before lunch \u2026 and then drink whisky in the evenings.&quot; He said: &quot;The thing is with the literary Bond, as opposed to the cinematic Bond, is that he&apos;s a very complex character. I mean he is a cool, capable guy and he&apos;s a very successful operative, but what makes him fascinating for readers is the darker side. He&apos;s troubled, he makes mistakes, and I think that three-dimensional portrait of him you get in the novels explains why he&apos;s not just some cardboard caricature spy, he&apos;s a real living, breathing, interesting individual.&quot; Boyd said he had discussions with the current 007, Daniel Craig, about whether he should write the book: &quot;I knew he was going to say yes.&quot; The writer agreed there were elements of racism and misogyny in Fleming&apos;s Bond: &quot;There&apos;s no doubt they are reflective of the unthinking attitudes a man of his class, era and education would have.&quot; Boyd said he had not set out to make his Bond ultra-modern but the book was set in 1969, a time of huge shifts in attitudes when &quot;an intelligent man such as Bond could not be unaware of the way society and values were shifting&quot;. The book was launched extravagantly. Boyd signed seven copies that were each placed in locked briefcases to be driven in seven vintage Jensen cars to Heathrow. From there they would accompany BA pilots, in their cockpits, to Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Zurich, Los Angeles, Delhi, Cape Town and Sydney where they would be handed to a designated recipient. Boyd said he had been a fan of the books more than the films since reading From Russia With Love as &quot;an illicit thrill&quot; after lights out at his boarding school. Boyd does not expect Solo to become a film, not least because they are now set in the present day, but if it does he at least knows the actor he would want to play Bond; as Fleming once said, 007 looked like the swarthily handsome American songwriter and performer Hoagy Carmichael. &quot;Daniel Day-Lewis looks like Hoagy Carmichael.&quot;", "sentences": ["From there they would accompany BA pilots, in their cockpits, to Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Zurich, Los Angeles, Delhi, Cape Town and Sydney where they would be handed to a designated recipient."], "title": "William Boyd's Bond: it's not just casual sex.

Last year was also a record year, with the show breaking through the 50,000 visitor barrier for the first time. In fact, the broadcast event has been growing steadily for the last few years, despite the sometimes deep pessimism found in the broadcasting industry itself. One reason for IBC&apos;s continued growth, but also that pessimism, is the continuing move away from conventional broadcasting and towards internet-based, or &quot;over the top&quot; (OTT) services. There are far more companies \u2013 and in some ways, more people \u2013 involved in audio and video than just a decade ago. They just might not all consider themselves broadcasters. Technology giants such as Cisco and Microsoft jostle for space with smaller, online startups; keynotes from Google staffers attract large crowds and plenty of press coverage. Regular broadcasters could be forgiven for feeling edged out. But this pessimism might well be easing, if the views of delegates and exhibitors at this year&apos;s IBC are anything to go by. The broadcast industry seems to be bouncing back: there is a sense that there is more money around, there are deals to be done, and above all, there are plenty of viewers and listeners hungry for quality content. &quot;People have been glum for the wrong reasons,&quot; says Bill Roberts, director of video product management at Adobe, the creative software publisher. &quot;Never before has more content been captured or consumed. The barriers to content creation are low, but monetisation is changing for the first time in 50 years.&quot; The trend Roberts alludes to is the way creating broadcast content is becoming cheaper and more democratic: cheaper cameras, such as DSLRs \u2013 stills cameras that can record high-quality video \u2013 easier video editing tools, and above all, cheap or even free content distribution over the internet. Business models, though, are only just catching up. Monolithic, often state-backed broadcasters that control both production, and distribution through the transmission networks, are losing ground to more creative, more flexible and sometimes better-resourced satellite and cable channels. Increasingly, they are losing ground too, to internet-only, or &quot;internet first&quot; operations. As Roberts points out, OTT video distributor Netflix has branched out into original content, creating the US series House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. And Netflix can more properly be called an internet-first service rather than purely an online service: the company recently announced its programming would be available to Virgin Media subscribers, via their set-top boxes. This greater convergence between online and conventional broadcasting is a trend that has been apparent at IBC for a number of years now. As Marco Vernocchi, global head of media and entertainment at Accenture, the management consultancy, points out, broadcasters are trying hard to tap into the interactivity and social media feedback the internet can provide. The &quot;fourth screen&quot;, where viewers interact with a channel or programme via a tablet device or smartphone, is here to stay he believes, and broadcasters will continue to invest in it. &quot;Broadcasters understand the importance and power of this,&quot; Vernocchi says. &quot;They are smart people. Are they able to compete with more technology-driven platforms? Probably not yet. But they understand the challenge and they are working on it.&quot; But broadcasters are also looking at ways to stand out from the growing crowd of internet and OTT services. One way to do this, some experts believe, is through 4K or &quot;Ultra HD&quot; video. Ultra HD was certainly one of the main talking points at this year&apos;s IBC, as it was at the IFA consumer trade fair in Berlin earlier this month. Moving to 4K will mean a significant investment by programme makers, broadcasters and, ultimately, consumers. Currently, a 4K TV costs around \u00a34,000, although cheaper 4K devices, such as tablet computers, are coming on to the market. On the production side, the cost of 4K acquisition remains high. Sony has launched an &quot;entry-level&quot; 4K camera, for US$6,500. Canon&apos;s 4K EOS-1D C DSLR was recently approved for HD TV making by the European Broadcasting Union, yet there is no standard for 4K. That camera is being used by production companies such as Stargate Studios, which, among other programmes, works on Dr Who for the BBC. The fact that the cameras are smaller and lighter than conventional cine cameras and relatively inexpensive makes them ideal for shooting &quot;plates&quot; for greenscreen work, says Sam Nicholson, the studio&apos;s CEO. But there is wariness around 4K too: no-one in broadcasting wants, or can afford, a repeat of 3D TV, an equally-hyped technology that failed to win over consumers. But there are differences between 4K and 3D, according to both broadcasters and manufacturers. &quot;4K&apos;s value is already being recognised in post production,&quot; says Kieran Magee, director of professional imaging at Canon Europe. &quot;And if you have good enough 4K, it has the same [immersive] effects as 3D&quot;. Moreover, 4K TV works without the need for viewers to wear special glasses, and 4K equipment generally works well in HD too, something that was not always true for 3D.      &quot;We&apos;ve already seen 4K cinema and cinematography, and we&apos;ve demonstrated how 4K live production is coming on stream&quot;, says Peter Sykes, strategic technology development manager at Sony Europe. &quot;It&apos;s about putting the 4K experience into as many hands as possible.&quot; But broadcasters are also seeing 4K as a way of setting their content apart from the mass of consumer-generated, often rough and ready material, available online. &quot;Content creators are pushing 4K as a differentiating element, to compete with consumer content,&quot; says Accenture&apos;s Vernocchi. &quot;They need to create something of higher and higher quality. The manufacturers, the TV sets, are getting ready for that.&quot; And the fact that 4K is an evolutionary improvement over HD TV could well count in its favour. Already, producers are shooting material in 4K to give more options in post-production, or to future proof their content, even if channels cannot transmit 4K yet. Unlike 3D, 4K is not an entirely separate workflow.      &quot;Transmission is still the missing link for 4K,&quot; says David Mercer, principal analyst at industry research firm Strategy Analytics. &quot;And the industry is still recovering from the transition to HD, so they are cautious about spending millions to move to 4K. But there will be a push to persuade consumers to buy Ultra HD TVs. Ultimately, the big driver will be the pay TV channels: there is a growing view that 4K can drive new revenues.&quot; If that is the case, then there should be a few more smiling faces on the early morning flights to Amsterdam this time next year.

The fucking world is running out of gas.&quot; So begins John Updike&apos;s novel Rabbit Is Rich, which is set in the 1970s, when it seemed like the world was indeed running out of gasoline. Set against a backdrop of American unease heightened by petrol rationing and long fractious queues at gas pumps, Updike&apos;s story illustrates how important oil is to the smooth running of things, both automotive and sociopolitical. America runs on gasoline. So does the American dream, as shown in so many stories, songs and films that hymn the open road and the fast car as the ultimate symbol of freedom. This is one of the subtexts of Gasoline, a book of photographs of American gas stations rescued from various newspaper archives and edited into a visual meta-narrrative by the British photography writer David Campany. It&apos;s an intriguing book, not least because its publication chimes with the 50th anniversary of one of the most iconic photobooks of all time: Ed Ruscha&apos;s Twentysix Gasoline Stations. Ruscha commercially printed his book of wilfully anonymous photographs as an antidote to the overly precious, limited-edition, collectable artist&apos;s book, producing a first print run of 400 and selling it for $3 a copy. As Campany notes in an interview included in Gasoline, the very &quot;stylelessness&quot; of Ruscha&apos;s images has become their defining aspect. &quot;The problem is that photographs don&apos;t remain unspecial and styleless for long. In unforeseen ways, the passing of time renders them significant.&quot;     Gasoline Shortage Baltimore & Maryland. 15 June 1979. Pat Sullivan, Frustrated.       Photograph: Richard Childress    So it is with these found images of gasoline stations. They are, Campany notes, &quot;a good measure of what is going on in society&quot;, whether that is austerity or growth, changes in car manufacture or the decline of industrial cities and the freeways that link them. The cover image is one of the most striking: a young woman slumped on the steering wheel of her car, her head resting on her forearm as if exhausted or exasperated. This is the image from which the entire project sprang. Her name is Pat Sullivan and she was photographed while waiting in line at a gasoline station in Baltimore in 1979. A press cutting on the back of the original image, also included in the book, reads: &quot;Pat Sullivan lowers her head in despair while waiting for gas in a long line yesterday at Lafayette and Charles. The lines were long again this morning ...&quot;     Gasoline Shortage Balitimore & Maryland. 15 June 1979. Pat Sullivan, Frustrated.    Photograph: Richard Childress    Campany was struck by the beauty of the image, which like most of these photographs has been marked by the grease pen of a newspaper&apos;s art director. &quot;The hair and the car have been retouched almost as if the newspaper wanted her to look her best even at this low point ... But that image was so evocative that I felt I wanted to place it in a story of the second half of the 20th century.&quot; Which is just what Gasoline does. There are images of gas station attendants and customers, iconic signage from a time before global corporations became tarnished \u2013 Gulf, Shell, Esso, BP \u2013 as well as local roadside stations in all their vernacular splendour, and sites where gasoline stations are about to be built or have just been demolished. There is black humour \u2013 a neon sign that reads We Wash Foreign Cars With Imported Water \u2013 and characteristic American stoicism \u2013 another reads No Gas Happy Holidays. There are images of gas stations that have just been robbed, destroyed by hurricanes, flooded and hit by cars. Gasoline is an observational history of post-war America that is as richly suggestive as Twentysix Gasoline Stations is blank and detached. It shows how central gasoline is to the American way of life but, as Campany notes, it could also be read as &quot;an allegory about news photography. Or a minor history of car design, or vernacular architecture, or street graphics, or outfits worn by pump attendants. All of the above.&quot; NOW SEE THIS The second edition of the Unseen photo fair opens on Thursday 26 September in Amsterdam, showing new and previously unexhibited work plus forums, panels, an independent book fair and upcoming talent selected by Foam magazine.

Never mind that! We have debuts for Denis Law and George Best, an emotional post-Munich return for Bobby Charlton, a stat-tastic Indian summer for Johnny Giles, United all strung out on drugs, and the signature performance of Big Ron&apos;s classic Cunningham-Regis side. These two should get it on more often ... 1) Manchester United 2-2 West Bromwich Albion (August 1962) Matt Busby spent most of the summer of 1962 chasing Torino striker Denis Law. Or, to be strictly accurate, chasing the haughty Torino president Angelo Filippone, whose blessing was required to sign the unhappy emigrant. First Busby flew to Amsterdam, where he knew Filippone would be watching the European Cup final between Benfica and Real Madrid, hoping to be granted a bit of facetime. Filippone could not be bothered to meet. A date was arranged in Lausanne - which the Torino overlord failed to grace with his presence. So yet another confab was set for Turin. Having been assured that this one really was on, Busby once again put in some hard yards. Bolting from Majorca, where United were involved in a pre-season tournament, he jumped on a flight to Geneva, then zipped over the Alps in a fast motorcar - only to find Filippone once again couldn&apos;t be arsed to show. His second in command was sent instead, but he quoted Busby a fee of \u00a3200,000, a price that would have outstripped the world record paid by Internazionale for (the original) Luis Suarez by nearly \u00a350,000. At this point, many gallons of steam whistled from the exasperated United manager&apos;s lugs, as he skipped around the room on both feet in the &apos;Animated&apos; style. That&apos;s an end of that, then. And after all that effort too. A month later, a Torino mandarin phoned Busby and offered Law to United for \u00a3115,000. Simple as that. Busby, scratching his head in contemplation of this post-palaver volte-face, quickly did the deal anyway. Law gave Busby an instant reward for all this breathless bother. In the opening match of the new season against West Bromwich Albion, he scored with a glancing header after seven minutes. It was United&apos;s second goal of the game, David Herd having opened the scoring after 90 seconds. The 51,685 souls who had traipsed into Old Trafford were cock-a-hoop. But the goodtime vibe didn&apos;t last long. With Don Howe tackling hard, Law was afforded little room for the rest of the match. Derek Kevan pulled one back for the visitors on 75 minutes with a rasping shot, then with five minutes to go, Keith Smith pounced on a poor Maurice Setters backpass to equalise. The bumper crowd, proving preposterous impatience isn&apos;t a modern disease, made their displeasure known. &quot;One cannot recall having heard the slow handclap at Old Trafford so early in the season,&quot; reported the Guardian. &quot;Is this a record?&quot; David Moyes will be thoroughly grateful times have changed. 2) Manchester United 1-0 West Bromwich Albion (September 1963) A year on, another epochal debut. With winger Ian Moir injured, Matt Busby decided it was time to blood a 17-year-old George Best. Fellow youth teamer Eamon Dunphy thought the young Irishman&apos;s ascension had come too soon. He had blamed Best for United getting knocked out of the previous season&apos;s FA Youth Cup - &quot;He fucked around on the left wing all night,&quot; recalled Dunphy in his Busby tome A Strange Kind of Glory \u2013 and wasn&apos;t sure there had been any improvement in the interim. Easy to knock that analysis in retrospect, but Dunphy was right about the timing in some respects. Best approached his debut with trademark insouciance \u2013 he sat in the corner of the dressing room idly flicking through the club programme, then popped out for a cup of tea with his mates, only returning a quarter of an hour before kick off \u2013 but the match would prove a stern test for the young whippet. He was up against the no-nonsense Welsh international Graham Williams, and so rough was the treatment meted out, the Guardian noted he &quot;twice sought refuge for short spells on the opposite wing&quot;. Busby sent the young man back to the reserves for three months to think on. &quot;He was a schoolboy among men,&quot; noted Dunphy, &quot;and he played like a schoolboy as well.&quot; Then again, Best started the move which led to the only goal of the game, slipping a short pass to Nobby Stiles, the busy midfielder shuttling the ball across the area to David Sadler, who belted home. The wise Busby brought a refreshed Best back against Burnley at the end of December, the young winger scoring on his second league outing in a 5-1 win. Three weeks later, Best scored his second goal for United&apos;s first XI, against - one goal away from the perfect symmetry - West Bromwich Albion, an angled drive which was the culmination of some fucking around on the wing. 3) West Bromwich Albion 2-2 Manchester United (March 1958) On the evening Manchester United made their emotional return to action after the Munich air disaster, beating Sheffield Wednesday 3-0 in the fifth round of the FA Cup at a sepulchral then celebratory Old Trafford, West Brom were seeing off Wednesday&apos;s neighbours United in the same competition atThe Hawthorns. Their 4-1 victory set up a home quarter-final against Manchester United, a match which the manager Vic Buckingham approached with relish. &quot;We will win 6-0,&quot; he announced. The prediction was rooted in logic. West Brom had seen off the Busby Babes early in the 1957/58 season, Bobby Robson the two-goal hero in a 4-3 victory at The Hawthorns, and United were obviously a weakened proposition after the tragedy. The Baggies, on the other hand, were looking certain of a high finish in the first division, even if catching the runaway leaders, Wolverhampton Wanderers, looked beyond them. It was the last hurrah for some of the superlative side which had won the 1954 FA Cup and narrowly missed out on the Double. One could understand Buckingham&apos;s confidence. But it didn&apos;t quite work out as Buckingham had hoped. United were buoyed by the return of Bobby Charlton, astonishingly back in red a mere 23 days after the harrowing crash. The staunch young man took all of five minutes to set up the opening goal for Ernie Taylor. West Brom equalised through Ronnie Allen, finishing off a melee in the box also involving Derek Kevan and Robson, but Alex Dawson&apos;s header reclaimed the lead for United before half-time. United held on until 86 minutes, but their brave, youthful endeavour caught up with them. &quot;Players too young to make the ball do the work had done it all on their own legs,&quot; reported the Manchester Guardian, &quot;and now those legs, no more than human, could do no more. The furious pace and enthusiasm of their play and the emotionally charged atmosphere had, until now, obscured some of the technical shortcomings which, at slower pace, became sadly obvious.&quot; Allen thundered a 30-yarder which Harry Gregg could only parry. Roy Horobin lashed it home. Albion had earned themselves a replay at Old Trafford, but the semis were beyond them. The replay remained goalless until 90 seconds from time, when Charlton set up Colin Webster for the only goal. &quot;There have been some remarkable ovations since the United team first took the field after the Munich disaster,&quot; noted this paper, &quot;but nothing like the cheers from the crowd of over 60,000 when the all-important goal was scored, and it continued long after the final whistle.&quot; United were in the semi-finals, a fact relayed almost immediately to Matt Busby, still in a Munich hospital. His reaction? &quot;Bang on! Wonderful!&quot; Meanwhile let&apos;s be scrupulously fair to Buckingham, who wasn&apos;t that far off the mark, despite it all. By a quirk of the fixture list, West Brom returned to Old Trafford in the league three days later - and thrashed United 4-0. 4) West Bromwich Albion 4-0 Manchester United (October 1976) The Baggies really had United&apos;s number in the mid to late Seventies. Here&apos;s the first of three famous thrashings, from the start of the 1976/77 season, when Johnny Giles, the erstwhile Leeds legend but also a member of United&apos;s 1963 FA Cup-winning side, put Tommy Docherty&apos;s entertaining Coppell-McIlroy-Macari-Hill team to the sword with a little swash and buckle of his own. Giles, 35 years of age, his glory days behind him, raged against the dying of the light in a one-man show. &quot;It is one thing having a brain which tells you where a pass should go,&quot; reported this paper, &quot;but another to have the physical coordination and skill to put it there.&quot; These were the days long before statistics and raw data had taken over, and reading the sports pages felt like studying for a PhD in fractal geometry, but so dominant was Giles&apos; display that our man Richard Yallop felt the need to tot up the numbers. Giles made 71 passes that afternoon, and only four went astray, some total in an era where possession was at a premium in English football. &quot;You have to add to that the quality of each pass, the weight with which it was delivered, making it always immediately controllable by the receiver. For anybody who believes the beauty of football lies in its passing, the afternoon was a joy.&quot; The cherry on the cake was a screamer into the top corner from 25 yards which evaded the desperate stretch of Alex Stepney. A real energy piece, especially when you consider Giles was also managing West Brom and the Republic of Ireland at the same time. (His was the first name on \u2013 arguably the club&apos;s greatest contribution to football, this \u2013 Albion&apos;s poetic and Waltonesque managerial roll call of the 70s and 80s: Johnny, Ronnie, John, Ron, Ronnie, Ron, Johnny, Nobby, Ron, Ron.) The thrashing knocked the stuffing out of United, who won only one of their next 10 games (a futile first-leg Uefa Cup win over Juventus, 1-0, which was easily overturned in Turin) and flirted with the relegation places before turning their season around with an unbeaten run of 14 wins in 16 league and cup matches. Albion should have beaten United in that run - they were 2-0 up in the return at Old Trafford thanks to another measured display from Giles, a glittering performance from new \u00a3110,000 signing Laurie Cunningham, and a goal from the &quot;immensely promising midfield player&quot; Bryan Robson, but Gordon Hill netted a penalty and Steve Coppell scored an injury-time equaliser. Still, it was becoming clear that this West Brom vintage were beginning to enjoy playing against United. 5) West Bromwich Albion 4-0 Manchester United (October 1977) Giles didn&apos;t stick around, though. Less than a month after that 2-2 draw at Old Trafford, he announced his resignation as player-manager, in order to return to Ireland to develop the game back home. &quot;I must make it clear that I am not leaving in search of higher income or because of any disagreement, for I have been treated with courtesy and consideration,&quot; he said. &quot;Football and football management are precarious professions. I frequently wonder why the government, which cares so much for the well-being of each and every member of society, does not make it compulsory to print a health warning on a manager&apos;s contract, so high is the mortality rate.&quot; Ronnie Allen took over. It was all change at United, too, Tommy Docherty having got his zip stuck during the summer, Dave Sexton taking his place. But the trend of Albion enjoying themselves at United&apos;s expense continued apace, with a repeat of the previous season&apos;s scoreline. John Wile \u2013 &quot;mobile, versatile in defence and attack, and arrogantly dominant in the air&quot; \u2013 opened the scoring for Albion with a header, and United were polished off in the second half with three goals in a 12-minute blitz, a couple from David Cross and one from Cunningham. United were thoroughly outplayed \u2013 again \u2013 but this time they at least had an excuse. A couple of days later, they were due to play an exhibition match in Iran. As advised by government quacks, the team had been given cholera vaccinations the week before. Nobody, however, had considered the potential side effects. The Greenhoff brothers were laid low, while several other members of the team became distracted and queasy. A zoned-out United were thumped 4-0 in the Cup Winners Cup by Porto, then lost by the same score here. After winning 2-0 in Iran, the strung-out selection rounded off this chemically assisted sequence with another loss, 2-1 at Aston Villa. Steve Coppell later suggested that a deal had been struck between United and the government to throw some diplomatic shapes in Iran in exchange for help in lifting the European ban then placed on the club&apos;s feisty support. Quadruples all round! 6) Manchester United 3-5 West Bromwich Albion (December 1978) To get some sort of idea of Laurie Cunningham&apos;s enchanting grace, here&apos;s Arthur Rowe, the architect of Tottenham&apos;s famous push-and-run title winners of 1950/51 and advisor to Orient in his dotage, who said this to the legendary Frank Keating in the mid-70s while the player, then 17, was still at Brisbane Road: &quot;Tell you the truth, nothing much in our game now turns me on - but this boy Cunningham excites me more than anyone I can remember. When I turn up for training and little Laurie&apos;s off sick, or with another batch of players, I&apos;m always terribly disappointed, you know, really terribly.&quot; &quot;And that,&quot; noted Keating, &quot;from the man who&apos;d seen it all.&quot; This was arguably Cunningham&apos;s, and certainly this fondly remembered team&apos;s, signature performance. They timed their arrival at Old Trafford perfectly: United had just lost 3-0 at Bolton before suffering a Boxing Day massacre at Anfield, where Liverpool tonked them 3-0. United&apos;s unhappy holidays had to bottom out sometime, surely, and they sort of did here, in as much as they didn&apos;t play particularly badly at all. They were just steamrollered by a team at the very top of their game. United&apos;s notorious 70s support were, even by the unenlightened standards of the day, making a show of themselves, booing every touch of Cunningham, Cyrille Regis and Brendan Batson to the rafters. The knuckleheads dragging United&apos;s name through the gutter that day got their karmic comeuppance in one of the greatest top-flight games of all time. United gave as good as they got in the first half. Brian Greenhoff opened the scoring with an outrageous volley into the top right from the edge of the area. Cunningham, abuse ringing around him, teased a pass in from the left and set up Tony Brown for the equaliser. The winger then stepped it up, sashaying past two desperate challenges before taking out two more men with a pass that found Regis on the edge of the box. A smooth backheel found Len Cantello, who roofed home. Gordon McQueen&apos;s header and McIlroy&apos;s snaky run regained the lead for United, before Brown bundled home at the end of the first half, the six-goal spoils shared. The second half was all about Regis, who had a header cleared off the line by Greenhoff, saw a 25-yarder clawed away from the top right by Gary Bailey, sent Cunningham through to score West Brom&apos;s fourth, and Cantelloed a fifth into the roof of the net to put a sheen on the scoreline. The gulf in class was perhaps best illustrated by that Cunningham goal: as the winger made his way down the inside-right channel before burying the ball in the bottom left, Stewart Houston took a wild swipe at his ankles, but connected only with fresh air. United were thrashing around helplessly in a match the Observer called The Avalanche in the Snow. Granada Television offered champagne to each side&apos;s men of the match, with the managers selecting their favourites. Sexton went for Steve Coppell, while Ron Atkinson gave Regis the nod after announcing that it would be a &quot;toss-up between one of the coloured front people&quot;. Oh Ron!

Once again this hugely significant event for the world&apos;s content owners offered some fascinating insights into the fast-moving and converging marketplace we work in, with this year&apos;s show highlighting four interesting new publishing and delivery opportunities and trends. Europe&apos;s internet bandwidthThe increasing availability of high bandwidth internet connectivity and capacity in Europe allows not only the consumer to enjoy their media more easily, it also allows technical facilities to better support the digital travel of media files from origination to destination digitally. New compression technology allows transportation of even heavier files (think of 4K or Ultra HD movies or series), contributing to efficient use of that same bandwidth. Even one step further, using software as a service (SaaS) products in the media industry potentially removes the need for content owners to invest in capital intensive technology themselves. Delivery of the latest episode of a popular series within 24 hours of its release in the USA, not only means a greater audience being reached faster and delivering greater monetisation, it also reduces the demand for pirate copies. MetadataThe convergence of metadata and media, embedding the data to enrich the content offering, is more than just an opportunity for media owners. This is changing the landscape for (advertising placement within) programming and movies, allowing customers to interact with the content in a more personalised and responsive way. Netflix, fresh from scooping its first-ever Emmy Award, is a great example of a company that is embracing technology and the use of data it retrieves from its customers. Content everywhereBy presenting your media on the right platform, in the right configuration at the right time, the opportunities for media owners to multiply the value of their content is growing exponentially. Not only does serving multi territories with multi languages become relevant, but also multi devices with multi specifications, and multi moments in time with multi versions, opens a wealth of additional monetisation opportunities for great content. With every new platform and device come a new &apos;standard&apos; way of operating so this is no simple task, but technology is there to help. Within our operations our focus is on delivering many versions of the media to many platforms and screens as efficiently as possible. Fibre rolloutEurope&apos;s high paced fibre rollout for the B2B and B2C market certainly evokes a discussion on using fibre as a very viable delivery method for media owners as well. Traditional satellite distribution of channels to be included in cable or DTH offerings is being seriously challenged by fibre distribution. Fibre is way more cost-effective to launch channels across Europe, where the option exists. The rollout of high speed connections across Europe to support the consumer demand for internet is also providing an opportunity for broadcasters. The demonstration we built for IBC last year, showed a broadcast service being carried over a standard UPC 120Mb/s consumer connection. So as IBC becomes a distant memory, once again we are all left excited about the future opportunities for our industry. From pan-European data highways and high-capacity internet exchange hubs, to efficiencies in compression and smart data storage, technology has taken a huge step forward and has opened up a number of opportunities for the European broadcasting industry.

Eurostar and Keolis, both majority-owned by the French state rail operator, SNCF, have announced a joint venture to bid for the contract. The Department for Transport (DfT) will start vetting bidders next month, with a view to restoring the line to the private sector in March 2015. The east coast franchise is currently run by a government-owned company, Directly Operated Railways (DOR). It was brought in to operate the line as East Coast after National Express defaulted on the London-Edinburgh franchise in 2009, when the transport group admitted it could not afford the \u00a31.4bn in payments due over the life of the contract. By contrast, East Coast has paid more than \u00a3600m in premiums to the government over the past two years. Labour has said it would keep the east coast mainline in public hands. At its conference the shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, attacked the &quot;nonsense&quot; of allowing foreign state-backed firms to run UK railway franchises while excluding DOR. Deutsche Bahn, the German state-owned rail company, is also a prominent player in Britain through its ownership of Arriva, the business that operates the Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry and Arriva Trains Wales franchises. The DfT has said it will try to attract bids from as many international firms as possible in order to promote competition. A bidders&apos; day in July attracted interest from firms in Europe and the far east. Keolis, which already operates four train franchises in the UK in a partnership with Go-Ahead Group, will be the lead partner in the bid, with a minority share to be held by Eurostar. It marks a further potential expansion for Eurostar, which last week announced it would start direct services between London and Amsterdam.

Celtic discovered precisely that. Anger was the overwhelming emotion in Glasgow&apos;s east end after the dismissal of the Celtic captain, Scott Brown, proved the defining moment of a taut encounter. Brown&apos;s departure on the hour was sufficient to hand Barcelona the impetus they needed to secure victory by a single Cesc F\u00e1bregas goal. It was a success they barely merited from a match that regressed into the realms of the bad tempered for the closing 30 minutes. Thereafter, discussion inevitably surrounded Brown&apos;s clash with Neymar. Brown was punished for a needless kick after a foul on Bar\u00e7a&apos;s Brazilian forward, a matter that Neil Lennon regarded as unduly harsh. &quot;I think it was very soft,&quot; said Celtic&apos;s manager. &quot;If there was any contact, it was minimal. There was a lot more going on in the game that warranted heavy punishment. I don&apos;t think Neymar does himself any favours with the way he behaves at times. I don&apos;t think I need to justify my defending of my captain; I think the sending off is uncalled for and unnecessary.&quot; Lennon could be happier with events in Amsterdam, where a draw between Ajax and Milan keeps Celtic&apos;s hopes of progression to the last 16 alive. The Barcelona coach, Gerardo Martino, used universal managerial language when assessing what occurred between Brown and Neymar. &quot;I couldn&apos;t see it,&quot; insisted Martino, before refusing to comment on Neymar&apos;s behaviour. Celtic hope could be derived from recent history. Last November&apos;s win over Bar\u00e7a here created shockwaves all over Europe, while earning Lennon and his players the kind of glowing recognition that could never arrive on account of dominance in Scotland. The ominous flipside to the events of last season for the hosts was that Barcelona could be forewarned and forearmed for their latest visit to Glasgow. Martino&apos;s team have won their opening seven La Liga matches in creating a club record; Lionel Messi was missing for this Group H tie but a front three of Pedro, F\u00e1bregas and Neymar looked a suitably potent antidote to that. The opening hour was noticeably low on clear-cut chances, in itself a credit to Celtic. That much apparently frustrated Neymar, with the striker fortunate to escape without a booking for throwing himself to the ground, 20 yards from the Celtic goal, after 25 minutes. The former Santos player slid the ball narrowly wide, five minutes short of the break, when meeting a Dani Alves cross. That served as a reminder to Celtic, who had impressively kept the Catalans at arm&apos;s length, as to the value of concentration. Xavi proved likewise, with a free-kick that prompted Fraser Forster into an unorthodox save only seconds before half-time. A hitherto tame contest was to explode into life 40 yards from the Celtic goal. Brown fouled the marauding Neymar, in itself not an incident worthy of a red card. Where the Celtic midfielder erred was offering a kick towards an opponent who would never be slow in making the most of it. This Champions League has not been kind to Brown, who fouled Mario Balotelli in the San Siro a fortnight ago in conceding the free-kick that led to Milan&apos;s second goal of a 2-0 win over Celtic. Brown gave little by way of protest before heading to the dressing room but the home support more than made up for that, with Neymar&apos;s every move thereafter met by enraged noise. Amid this almighty din, Lennon&apos;s response was to introduce James Forrest and Beram Kayal from among his substitutes. That almost paid off immediately as Forrest&apos;s half-volley forced an excellent Victor Vald\u00e9s save. From the corner, Charlie Mulgrew sent his free header agonisingly wide. Bar\u00e7a predictably supplied immediate punishment. The substitute Alexis S\u00e1nchez crossed for F\u00e1bregas, anonymous to that point, who floated a header past the stranded Forster. Only brilliance from the goalkeeper prevented Barcelona from adding late gloss to their win. A bigger margin of victory would have been unduly cruel towards the hosts, who had suffered quite enough after Brown&apos;s premature departure.", "sentences": ["I don&apos;t think I need to justify my defending of my captain; I think the sending off is uncalled for and unnecessary.&quot; Lennon could be happier with events in Amsterdam, where a draw between Ajax and Milan keeps Celtic&apos;s hopes of progression to the last 16 alive."], "title": "Celtic 0-1 Barcelona | Champions League match report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/01/celtic-barcelona-champions-league", "tags": ["Champions League", "Celtic", "Barcelona", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-02T10:34:00Z", "article": "     This Mazzy Star-ish, folksy song is one of the highlights on Strasbourg-born Elsa&apos;s recently-released second album Marvelously Dangerous.

Now in its second year, it comprised two big buildings full of galleries touting their wares, plus a book market showing the state of independent publishing and the growth of what the catalogue calls &quot;beautiful books and their creators&quot;. There was also a Living Room chill-out zone, where photographers and the public mixed, watched films and took in talks as well as various &quot;pavilions&quot; \u2013 the Bright Young Things&apos; Pavilion and the Foam Magazine Pavilion. And there were bars, after-hours&apos; parties and a stall selling the ubiquitous frites with mayonnaise. The Unseen idea \u2013 &quot;to focus on undiscovered photography talent and unseen work by established photographers&quot; \u2013 was stretched to the limit here, and there was much familiar work on show. But I was immediately taken with an installation at the Steven Kasher Gallery stand, in which artists Martin Hyers and William Mebane paid homage to Uranian Phalanastery. (No, me neither.) An art collective founded on New York&apos;s Lower East Side in 1974, it was a mystical and esoteric venture. Its gurus saw Uranian Phalanastery as a mind-expanding pursuit that would challenge the constrictions of creativity, art and life itself, while altering the collective consciousness of America. I was guided through the site-specific installation \u2013 five mural-size prints that evoked the Uranian Phalanastry interior in all its jumbled strangeness \u2013 by a current devotee called One-Sun. It was half an hour well spent in a time capsule with walls that recreated the 1970s building and were overlaid with related ephemera: copies of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, outsider paintings, pamphlets, flyers \u2013 some of which featured visiting artists such as Claes Oldenburg and Jim Dine \u2013 and risqu\u00e9 pin-ups. A strange and intriguing installation that stood out from the ordered commercialism of the fair.     Edgy and often erotic ... Kiss by No 223, whose work is continually censored in China. Photograph: No 223 courtesy Stieglitz19    I was taken by the work of Lin Zhipeng, a Chinese photographer who goes under the name No 223, and whose edgy, often erotic work is continually censored by the authorities. Todd Hido&apos;s eerie night photographs of rural America looked even better than they do in his excellent books and seemed to unconsciously echo the work of Astrid Kruse Jensen, which is even more dreamlike and atmospheric. I also enjoyed Ashkan Honarvar&apos;s odd photocollages, in which the nude female body is reconfigured and adorned with fruit, leaves, butterflies, porcelain and fabric. It was interesting to see a large grid of Cristina de Middel&apos;s prints from her recent book with Self Publish Be Happy, which reworks West Side Story in a series of staged street tableaux. On a wall, they carried a weight I had not sensed before and seemed like a unified work. Over at the book market, Self Publish Be Happy were doing brisk business with their new publication, Lorenzo Vitturi&apos;s limited-edition book Dalston Anatomy, which merges brash documentary, makeshift sculpture and collage in its evocation of the energy of London&apos;s Ridley Road Market. My eye was drawn to a quieter corner where one Jim Reed, a native of Tennessee, was selling his one-off artists&apos; books which merge text and found photographs beautifully. Each one is handmade and ornately put together, then sold in an edition of one through his Easter Trouble Press. This is the ultimate example of the artist&apos;s book as art object and you can feel the love that he has put into each object. Next to him, a young photographer who uses analog, Lena Grass, had her first book, Nachtigall (Nightengale) on display. Darkly beautiful and nocturnal, it suggests a state of mind as much as any linear narrative. Well worth seeking out. As is Tranquillity by Heikki Kaski, which won the Unseen Dummy Book award. Comprising images of a place in California called Tranquillity, it was described by one of the judges, Jorg Colberg as a &quot;quiet, subtle and very well done book that needs a little time.

Two years ago I left the US for Amsterdam. I donated my hulking SUV to a local charity the night before my plane was due to leave. As a lifelong gearhead who has owned over 20 different cars I knew it would be tough going at first, both physically and emotionally. One of the first times I stepped out into the local bike lane, while huffing like a marathon runner and pumping my creaky legs as fast as I could, I was easily passed by a young mom in a bakfiets cargo bike with two kids in it, blond hair waving gently in the wind. But while there&#x27;s times I curse my lack of auto convenience (you try hauling enough beer for your rugby team drinkup in saddle bags) I don&#x27;t miss owning a car. Driving, yes. Owning a car? Never. No financial drain, no parking headaches, no sitting in crammed streets going nowhere, no feeling drained by the morning commute. I also dropped 20 kilos and soon enough I was overtaking moms in cargo bikes with ease. I still love cars, but now driving is a rare treat done on vacation, and in its way its far more pleasurable. I get to admire the beauty of automobiles without worrying where the dough for that next transmission rebuild will be found.

Elizabeth Gilbert&apos;s novel is a botanical odyssey through the 19th century, global in ambition, revelling in the period&apos;s insatiable curiosity about its world. While Henry and Alma Whittaker are\u00a0inventions, Banks was a historical person who accompanied Cook on his first voyage and gave us eucalyptus, acacia and Banksia. Gilbert fills in the historical gaps with exuberant brio. Opening with Banks, she closes with the British naturalist and contemporary of Darwin, Alfred Russel\u00a0Wallace. Picaresque in form, grotesque in characterisation and antic in disposition, The Signature of All Things whisks us through more than a century and from Kew to Hawaii, where Henry sees Captain Cook being clubbed to death. Two pages later Henry is off to\u00a0Peru, and settles in Philadelphia. Alma\u00a0will visit Tahiti and settle in Amsterdam. Her story is a historical-fantastical jeu d&apos;esprit, a feminist fable, a cabinet of curiosities, a scholarly romp. And very long indeed. Gilbert&apos;s bestselling memoir of her\u00a0pilgrimage to Italy and India, Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman&apos;s Search for Everything, followed her quest for wisdom after her divorce. When Alma takes off for Tahiti, she too sails in the\u00a0aftermath of a failed marriage and\u00a0to feed a gargantuan appetite for knowledge. The novel takes its title from Jakob B\u00f6hme&apos;s The Signature of All Things (1622), a work that enthrals Alma&apos;s dottily mystical husband, Ambrose Pike. According to B\u00f6hme, God imprinted prescriptions for human\u00a0ailments in medicinal plants \u2013 brain-shaped walnuts for headaches, celandines for jaundice. This archaic lore does nothing for Ambrose&apos;s health, nor can it satisfy Alma&apos;s curiosity \u2013 traditionally the sin of Eve, linked with lust and gluttony. Her concupiscent eye gobbles the world. Gilbert is fascinated by the 19th\u2011century passion for exploration, taxonomy and classification that led, via Darwin&apos;s barnacles, to his concept of evolution by natural selection. Sundry village entomologists and botanists were amateurs of biology. Gilbert&apos;s Alma is a comic-heroic magnification of this phenomenon. &quot;Less is more&quot; is hardly the author&apos;s watchword. The novel displays its own\u00a0narrative excesses in those of the\u00a0heroine: six-foot giantess Alma&apos;s knowledge of &quot;global bryology [was] excruciatingly dense&quot;; she is aware that &quot;my world has become too detailed&quot;. Gilbert&apos;s style is comparable: long paragraphs effloresce with superabundant detail. It&apos;s a tall tale, told with verve and wit \u2013 but all on the same note. And as the style of heavy levity can rarely adapt, so character cannot change, only disport itself in further prodigious arabesques. Alma&apos;s specialism \u2013 producing the novel&apos;s loveliest writing \u2013 is the microworld of moss. Beneath the magnifying glass, Alma studies &quot;a stupefying kingdom ... the Amazon jungle as seen from the back of a harpy eagle&quot;, with different continents where moss grows in mountain ranges, tiny deserts and &quot;deep, diminutive fjords&quot;. The microworld is equivalent to a view of\u00a0the firmament, &quot;as seen through one\u00a0of William Herschel&apos;s mighty telescopes&quot;. This focused writing is a\u00a0relief from prolix description. &quot;Who will ever kiss this encyclopaedia of a head?&quot; wonders Alma. Her amatory life is chiefly a matter of erotic self-discovery in the closet, where she triggers &quot;an up-fire, a\u00a0vortex of pleasure, a chimney-effect of heat ... a burst of phosphorescence&quot;. Her husband furnishes no heat and little light: he absconds, an unfit specimen of manhood. When Alma follows in Ambrose&apos;s wake to Tahiti, a\u00a0eureka moment of her own during a violent ball game triggers a discovery capable of pre-empting Darwin&apos;s in On\u00a0the Origin of Species. Thence comes her &quot;theory of competitive alteration&quot; \u2013 recognised by Alfred Russel Wallace on\u00a0a visit in 1883: &quot;Miss Whittaker ... There\u00a0were three of us.&quot; Gilbert cannily associates her heroine with the less acknowledged work of evolutionary discovery in Victorian England: ideas we still call Darwinian were also conceived and explored by other minds, &quot;comrades in\u00a0obscurity&quot;. \u2022 Stevie Davies&apos; Awakening is published by Parthian.", "sentences": ["Alma\u00a0will visit Tahiti and settle in Amsterdam."], "title": "The Signature of All Things by Elizabeth Gilbert \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/05/signature-things-elizabeth-gilbert-review", "tags": ["Science and nature", "Environment", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-05T23:05:20Z", "article": "&quot;I met him only once; he was sick by that time \u2013 it was the last year of his life. We had a talk \u2013 he was a nervous man, wary.&quot; So says Bernard Haitink of his meeting with the great Dmitri Shostakovich in 1975, after a performance by Haitink&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam in Moscow. &quot;Shostakovich said he had been moved by our concert, and I was terribly moved that he had been so,&quot; he adds. What a fitting encounter: between the last great composer of his kind and the last maestro from that golden age of conducting still touring and performing. Haitink, who was born in Amsterdam, turns 85 next year. His contemporaries Carlos Kleiber and Sir Colin Davis died in 2004 and this year respectively; Haitink really is in a league of his own. And as though to demonstrate his indefatigable commitment, he arrives in the UK this week for the first of two concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra that no one in the audience will forget: of Shostakovich&apos;s 4th and 15th symphonies. One from the depths of Stalin&apos;s terror \u2013 and seen by many as Shostakovich&apos;s requiem for it \u2013 the other his own personal valedictory symphony, written in 1971. &quot;The choice of these two,&quot; says Haitink, &quot;is simple \u2013 they&apos;re the symphonies I like most.&quot; He confesses: &quot;I&apos;m not sure I like all the Shostakovich symphonies \u2013 the quartets are more evenly superior; the symphonies are uneven for me.&quot; Haitink admits of his meeting with Shostakovich that &quot;at that time, I didn&apos;t know his music very well. I knew him as the composer of the 5th Symphony, and the great 8th.&quot; A year later, however, &quot;someone in management at the London Philharmonic suggested we do the 10th. I said, &apos;I don&apos;t know it, but let&apos;s look at it.&apos; And so it started, an entire symphony cycle, initially with the LPO, and continued with the Concertgebouw.&quot;     Haitink in rehearsals in the early 1970s. Photograph: Erich Auerbach/Getty Images    The cycle, for Decca, was crucial to the installation of Shostakovich&apos;s music into the western repertoire, from which he had been inexplicably scarce before the 1970s. Until then, great performances had been under Soviet and eastern European batons: Mravinsky, Kondrashin, Svetlanov Sanderling, Arvids Jansons and the composer&apos;s son, Maxim. Haitink thus came to the fore among great western interpreters of Shostakovich. Aside from his time with the LPO, Haitink has a lambent history with British orchestras and British music. He was director of the Glyndebourne Opera for a decade from 1978, and music director of the Royal Opera during an especially dynamic period from 1987 to 2002. He has often performed with the LSO as a guest, recently releasing a Beethoven symphony cycle, recorded live and hallmarked by, among other qualities, electrifying tempi. He has also re-recorded these two Shostakovich symphonies of late \u2013 a gale-force account of the 4th with the Chicago Symphony and a spacious, powerfully reflective 15th, also live, with the orchestra that has become synonymous with his name, the Concertgebouw. Haitink&apos;s reputation goes before him as among the less voluble conductors; rarely interviewed, supposedly hard to impress, Haitink speaks with his music. &quot;I&apos;m a musician, a conductor. I&apos;m lost for words,&quot; he says. Yet on the subject of these symphonies and the task ahead in London these next two weeks, he could not be more articulate\u00a0or refreshing to hear. Shostakovich began writing his 4th Symphony in the autumn of 1935, with his reputation high after the success of the opera Lady Macbeth of Mtensk. But during his composition of the symphony, the opera was assailed by Stalin himself through the pages of Pravda. &quot;Instead of repenting,&quot; Shostakovich later wrote to a friend, &quot;I wrote my 4th Symphony&quot;, a thrilling climax to what can be called his &quot;modernist&quot; period.     Shostakovich in the 1930s: 'Much of his work was like a skeleton \u2013 there was nothing superfluous.' Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    But Shostakovich withdrew the 4th, scheduled for premiere on 30\u00a0December 1936. It&apos;s a matter of conjecture whether he was pressured into doing so by the composers&apos; union, or did so of his own will to keep the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as himself, out of great danger. &quot;Amazing to think,&quot; says Haitink, &quot;that neither Shostakovich nor anyone else heard the symphony until 25\u00a0years later. It disappeared during the war, and he himself had only the piano version.&quot; An archivist at the Leningrad Philharmonic came upon the orchestral parts and assembled a score for premiere in 1961 during the Soviet &quot;thaw&quot;, nearly a decade after Stalin&apos;s death. The symphony is massive. Bold and challenging, volatile, dissonant and technically complex \u2013 alternating between attack and rumination. &quot;An incredible monster in many ways,&quot; says Haitink, &quot;and quite a strain on all of us, with the sheer volume of sound, and that first movement alone lasting nearly half an hour. &quot;It is incredibly powerful and moving\u2026 At times, impossible to play loud, because it&apos;s already louder than loud. There are huge passages of immense struggle; then everything comes to rest and there are reflective passages of beautiful writing for what becomes no more than a chamber orchestra. When Shostakovich heard it he said he hadn&apos;t known it was such a good piece!&quot; It&apos;s easy to forget how Shostakovich forms part of recent history. He outlived Jimi Hendrix by five years, and the 15th Symphony was premiered 15 years after West Side Story. It&apos;s an intimate and, one suspects, more personal work than his others for full orchestra \u2013 many have been tempted to find autobiographical references. The opening is extraordinary, said by the composer in his notes to represent a toyshop coming alive at night, and introduces a number of direct quotations from other famous music that flavour the entire work \u2013 first, Rossini&apos;s William Tell Overture. Why? &quot;Because the Rossini fits perfectly,&quot; says Haitink. &quot;Shostakovich himself said he didn&apos;t know why, just that the quotations had to be there.&quot; Then Haitink asks rhetorically, warming to his wider theme: &quot;Why is it that we need answers and explanations from Shostakovich all the time? This is great music and his reasons lie in the music.&quot; The glorious final movement is a searing symphonic farewell, at times beautiful and unsettling. &quot;I find it extremely touching,&quot; says Haitink, &quot;especially in the wake of the chords from Wagner, which entirely set the mood for this last movement.&quot; It opens with the Fate motif from Wagner&apos;s Ring, later associated with Shostakovich&apos;s own musical signature, DSCH.     Shostakovich in the 1950s.  Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    The final passage is an eerie and extraordinary valedictory symphonic statement, of clattering sounds against a single line held in the strings, fading to silence. The conductor Kurt Sanderling, who worked often with Shostakovich, found these sounds to represent fluctuations in hospital machinery, which diminish into a straight line on a screen once the patient loses life. Haitink has his own vision: &quot;It is like a skeleton. Much of Shostakovich&apos;s work was like a skeleton \u2013 there is nothing superfluous. A skeleton that is very frightening but also very beautiful and powerful.&quot; But for all the melancholy that pervades the finale, Haitink challenges the two-dimensional figure with which we are so often presented of Shostakovich in innumerable programme notes: depressive, miserable, laden. &quot;He was too great a musician to be miserable,&quot; insists Haitink. &quot;Sometimes his music depresses you; he embraces you in this sadness \u2013 this is Shostakovich. But he is cynical, perhaps sarcastic, also quirky and humorous. However,&quot; adds the maestro wisely, &quot;what Shostakovich does to hide himself is quite another thing.&quot; Significantly \u2013 and rarely \u2013 at no point during his discussion of these works does Haitink mention Stalin or explore the persecutions to which the composer was subject. &quot;We all know he was under political pressure,&quot; he says, &quot;but I don&apos;t want to think about that any more. How much was this music the work of the man and how much the consequence of political pressure?&quot; A view has formed in the west that places Shostakovich and his music almost exclusively within a historical context, defined by the composer&apos;s tortuous, often terrifying fortunes and misfortunes at the authorities&apos; whim. A didactic forging of what might be called a &quot;New York Shostakovich&quot;, stereotypically viewed from America as the dissident composer of a soundtrack to the Soviet narrative. There is a secret Russian voice running through Shostakovich&apos;s music and, one might presume, an element of confessional, but Haitink seeks to liberate a universal Shostakovich, as important to now as any time. &quot;I can&apos;t stand all that,&quot; he says boldly, &quot;the tying of every note to the political pressures. What do we know? Shostakovich knew what he wanted. Both the first and last resorts are the score itself. To start meddling with the score with extra-territorial interpretation \u2013 I hate this. There&apos;s quite enough in the score. The music is a colossal enough task in itself, without these considerations.&quot; Haitink recalls again the man he met in 1975: &quot;That special character he exuded, but haunted all the same. How do we know that he was like that because he was the victim of the political pressures? Maybe that is who he was, the man himself, and he&apos;d have been that same Shostakovich wherever he had lived. I wonder. What matters is the music he wrote and what we will play.&quot;", "sentences": ["We had a talk \u2013 he was a nervous man, wary.&quot; So says Bernard Haitink of his meeting with the great Dmitri Shostakovich in 1975, after a performance by Haitink&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam in Moscow.", "Haitink, who was born in Amsterdam, turns 85 next year."], "title": "Bernard Haitink: 'Shostakovich was too great to be miserable'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/06/bernard-haitink-shostakovich-london-interview", "tags": ["Bernard Haitink", "Classical music", "Dmitri Shostakovich", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-08T11:05:32Z", "article": "Location Husets Biograf is part of the three-building Huset KBH complex in the heart of Copenhagen that provides space for spoken word, standup, theatre, live music and film within its labyrinthine sprawl of rooms. The building The three buildings that comprise Huset KBH were squatted in the late 60s by groups of anarchists, hippies, artists and craftsmen who staked out their spheres of influence within what was now known as Huset (the House). The city eventually assumed administration of the place, transforming it into a multi-use &quot;culture house&quot; offering a variety of film, music, live theatre and functional dining experiences in the style of similar institutions on the Continent such as Amsterdam&apos;s more famous Milky Way. The cinema in Huset has been in continuous operation since 1973. With 63 seats and an atmospheric cafe, it is Denmark&apos;s cosiest venue as well as one of the most charming and eccentrically decorated.  The programme Husets Biograf stopped showing commercial arthouse features in 2011, when the industry started to phase out 35mm film printing and distribution. The venue had no way to meet the expensive upgrade to hard-drive projection. So it morphed from a marginal one-screen, second-run arthouse into a throwback repertory that might be described as a pocket-size mix of the Prince Charles and the old Scala Cinema, but with a more updated and community-based edge. It tends to favour cult, underground, grindhouse and midnight-movie style fare \u2013 it&apos;s home to both The Room and The Rocky Horror Picture Show \u2013 but its activities don&apos;t stop there. Husets Biograf also hosts monthly arrangements with foreign embassies, gives space to local film-makers, and \u2013 every August for the past eight years \u2013 stages a week-long extravaganza of open-air, drive-in style cinema, with movies unspooling on 16mm. Every month, a top name in Danish film production visits the cinema to screen clips and talk with guests in the auditorium, which basically resembles a giant living room. The venue is home to the Copenhagen short film festival and the Faces in the Dark Horror and Grindhouse festival, and has just staged Denmark&apos;s first sex workers film festival to great success. It also hosts the city&apos;s longest running children&apos;s film club, and has just put on a &quot;stop wasting food&quot; benefit. Its wild diversity of programming can be attributed to the open-minded Danish mentality, the absence of censorship and its own stubborn insistence not to be bound to any profile or brand. It is Denmark&apos;s most accessible and grassroots screening space, and occasionally hosts live music. The clientele Husets Biograf caters to a young clientele of students, hipsters, foreign visitors and film buffs, and stands as the country&apos;s most internationally-minded venue, with 99% of all films screened in English or with English subtitles. Further comments Husets Biograf is the last cinema in Denmark that still screens Super 8, 16mm and 35mm film and teaches 35mm operation to anyone who wishes to join the support group.

The\u00a0second week, you think: right, now I can get\u00a0over my jet lag, this is really good fun. And then, after the second week, it&apos;s a disaster. I\u00a0have\u00a0kids and a wife; you spend a lot of the time\u00a0quite homesick.&quot; He is at home in London, gearing up for last weekend&apos;s UK launch of Homeland season three, which has some ground to make up after a disappointing second season. Lewis is at the zenith of his fame, ebullient with success and exposure, and throwing out an energetic charm that rests, one imagines, on a firm faith in his own likability. (&quot;Where is your dress from?&quot; he asks. And, later, exhibiting high-level surveillance\u00a0skills that feel, as in Homeland, mildly operational: &quot;You bite your fingernails, but not all\u00a0of them.&quot;) He is in a jacket and tie, and has come straight from tea at the Ritz with a couple of bankers who\u00a0won him in a charity auction. It&apos;s an odd sort of duty, but two years into his post-Homeland celebrity, the 42-year-old is getting used to it, as well as to furtive stares in public places. (Sergeant Brody or no, a 6ft 1in redhead is hard to miss.) &quot;I\u00a0think we&apos;re OK,&quot; he says, sliding into his seat at a restaurant in Piccadilly, while a ripple of recognition moves through the room. The problem with Homeland season two was that, after a solid start, it rapidly descended into a\u00a0series of Houdini-like escape scenes and ludicrous strands of coincidence. The show&apos;s premise \u2013 CIA operatives battle terrorist sleeper cells on US soil \u2013 suddenly looked absurd. &quot;Yeah, I&apos;m aware of the criticisms,&quot; Lewis says. &quot;People feel betrayed. It&apos;s like football matches. There&apos;s a\u00a0sense of betrayal if it doesn&apos;t live up to expectation. We gave all our time to this shit.&quot; He\u00a0grins. &quot;People get irate.&quot; It&apos;s hard to imagine getting this kind of assessment out of his co-star Claire Danes. Lewis&apos;s Britishness gives him a certain licence, perhaps, and he is almost ostentatiously robust about the show and his own prospects within it. The success of Homeland took everyone on the production by surprise, and the success of the Danes/Lewis love affair upset the writers&apos; planned trajectory. Lewis is pretty sure they had intended to kill him off by now, and had to change\u00a0direction when the public responded to their weird chemistry. His strength as an actor has always been his ability to play ambiguity, particularly the bad behaviour of men in torment. (Think of Soames in the 2002 ITV remake of The Forsyte Saga, a monster for whom one nonetheless felt sorry.) As Sergeant Brody, Lewis has undergone more twists and turns of character than he ever did when he was doing Shakespeare. The appeal of the character lies in his cold, clear intelligence and inscrutable motivation, although it must be said I know a lot of women who enjoy watching him for less elevated reasons. If season two went off the rails, he says, it was because everyone was\u00a0caught on the hop by the success of season one. &quot;I think we had second novel syndrome. Second album syndrome. They ended up having to make melodramatic leaps and start using coincidence, which is never good. That&apos;s where the criticism was; that it wasn&apos;t quite as taut, psychologically, as season one. Suddenly characters were doing all sorts of extraordinary things. In its defence, Alex Gansa and the writers have always maintained that this is a fictitious world, not least because the CIA don&apos;t operate on home soil. So the whole thing is spurious. And second, look, we&apos;re not making a documentary.&quot;     Lewis as Brody in season three of Homeland. Photograph: Kent Smith/Showtime    For a long time Lewis wasn&apos;t interested in doing television. After Eton, he went to the Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama and for six years worked exclusively in the theatre. He had grand notions, which he looks back on with a mixture of nostalgia and derision: &quot;You&apos;re passionate and earnest and young, and you want\u00a0to talk about the theatre and acting all night\u00a0long; the romance of being on stage and the\u00a0shared experience of fellow actors and rehearsal rooms.&quot; He has one particularly embarrassing memory. &quot;When I was at drama school, I remember going to Amsterdam for new year and sitting with friends on the front of a P&amp;O ferry in the wind, having some sort of Titanic moment, declaring ourselves to be the new kings of theatre.&quot; He\u00a0makes a face. &quot;But that&apos;s the image.&quot; He had been taken to the theatre a lot as a child. His father worked in the City and his parents sent him to boarding school at the age of eight, so that North Carolina homesickness is nothing to those early years at school. He remembers the first term vividly. &quot;I ran around like a headless chicken, full of nerves, for two weeks. And then I cried for a\u00a0week. There was still caning when I was there. We were caned for the greatest sin there was, which was talking after lights out.&quot; Seriously? &quot;Yeah. Because it made everyone tired.&quot; He\u00a0raises an eyebrow. &quot;And if the school was tired, it couldn&apos;t operate well.&quot; So that happened to you? &quot;Yes. Regularly. Until my mother complained. It\u00a0was the end of the 70s. Things changed massively through the 80s. That was the end of a\u00a0more Dickensian way of schooling.&quot; What did she say to the school? &quot;Well, my mum\u00a0being my mum, she didn&apos;t complain because she thought it was being cruel to me, but\u00a0because it was clearly not working. Which was brilliant. Because I was being repeatedly caned. It&apos;s shocking to Americans \u2013 of course they can&apos;t believe it.&quot; He eventually came to enjoy Eton and, on the occasions he&apos;s been back, has always been struck by the privilege of having been there. &quot;I remain sort of interested and slightly befuddled by my five years there. It&apos;s such a rare existence. It feels a little bit like another time, another world.&quot; Lewis isn&apos;t surprised people are so curious about old Etonians, not least out of a revived hostility towards them for their over-representation in the Cameron government. When he was at school, he says, he felt harshly judged for different reasons. &quot;With the promotion of the middle class, being privileged was a mark against you. Thatcher was a grammar school girl and surrounded herself with those people in her cabinet \u2013 obviously there were exceptions such as Douglas Hurd. But the emphasis was on the ordinary man, working. And I can remember being very aware of the feminist movement in the\u00a080s; Andrea Dworkin, people like that, who were incredibly ferocious. And we all ducked down under the parapet. It felt like the start of new man-ism, and everyone had to be more sensitive, and certainly you didn&apos;t shout about your accent too much, or your male, privileged credentials. Because you might get a punch in the\u00a0gob. That&apos;s what I felt.&quot; This carried on into the Major government, and\u00a0then, &quot;with the Labour government coming in, even though Blair had been privately educated, it felt as if the old Etonian thing had been put out to pasture. And so for 20 years it had\u00a0novelty value. It wasn&apos;t in the spotlight at all.&quot; And now, once again, and to the annoyance of liberal Etonians, it&apos;s a byword for unearned privilege. &quot;With these guys suddenly back in power, it feels as if we are going back to the days of Lord Douglas Home, when Etonians were running the country, the time of empire \u2013 a\u00a0somewhat patriarchal time.&quot; Lewis was a fish out of water to some extent, in that he didn&apos;t want to go into the City, the law or the army. &quot;There are always writers coming out of these places, but fewer actors. There are one or two older actors \u2013 Hugh Laurie, although he won&apos;t thank me for calling him that \u2013 but a generation ahead. Then myself and Dominic West, and below us Tom [Hiddleston] and Eddie Redmayne.&quot; He was raised in a home where he had to knock on the living room door before entering if his father was in there. &quot;Ha! My kids don&apos;t do that. But I believe in good manners and structure, and sometimes a bit of formality. I believe in honour. There&apos;ll be plenty of times in your life \u2013 I\u00a0was saying this to my son the other day \u2013 when you&apos;re going to be really challenged. And there&apos;s going to be an easy way to deal with it, but it may not be the honourable way. All you should try to do is behave with honour. If you can. At all times.&quot; What triggered that lesson? He laughs. &quot;I had probably done something dishonourable myself.&quot; When he graduated from drama school, a\u00a0lot of Lewis&apos;s peers got off to a very quick start and &quot;were suddenly making rather glamorous movies: Joseph Fiennes, Ewan McGregor&quot;. But for years he was happy with the RSC. Then the hours started to pall. And something else: &quot;I started to feel that the theatre world was rather a small one. I&apos;ve always equated life with travel, with places to see and go. Theatre takes away your evenings and weekends. And after six or seven years, it really started to bother me that I was going to work when everyone else was coming home. I\u00a0was dying to just get up in the morning and live the day.&quot; What does that say about him? &quot;I don&apos;t know. It\u00a0might mean that at heart I&apos;m quite conventional. Maybe yearning for something that\u00a0was a bit more structured. But, of course, preferable to getting on the tube at 7am to go to an office and turn in a full solid day.&quot; He worried that he was backing his career into a corner. &quot;The idea that I would be one of these slightly over-the-top, fruity actors who would have an illustrious career on stage, but wouldn&apos;t start getting any kind of film work until I was 50 and then start playing wizards.&quot; By the time Lewis was invited to audition for Band Of Brothers, Steven Spielberg&apos;s second world war mini-series, in 2000, he was aching to\u00a0get on to bigger things. (He nearly messed up the second audition by going on a massive bender the night before. &quot;I&apos;d already seen Tom Hanks, and didn&apos;t realise they were going to want to see me again. I\u00a0had quite a sweaty meeting the next day. They videoed me the whole time. Gaunt and\u00a0sweaty.&quot;)     Lewis nearly messed up the second audition for Band of Brothers by going on a massive bender the night before. Photograph: HBO    He got the part, and the exposure led to film offers. At that stage he could have dropped everything and done what many British actors do: sit in LA for a year, attending every movie audition going and having a miserable time. He\u00a0was cured of the desire to go down that road by the experience of shooting a Hollywood movie\u00a0in Canada. &quot;A film called Dreamcatcher, arguably one of the biggest turkeys ever made. Poor Larry Kasdan [Body Heat, The Big Chill] didn&apos;t make a film after that. He went into a long depression. It had good ingredients: it was from a\u00a0Stephen King novel, and with a thrusting young cast. But I found it a bloated and corrupt and lonely experience.&quot; Why corrupt? &quot;Corrupt because of the length of time it took to make, and there was just this acceptance that we would keep spending millions of dollars to slowly churn out 30 seconds of film every day. It\u00a0was my first experience of a slow-moving studio film, where I had to try to keep my marbles\u00a0to do one line on Friday.&quot; Afterwards, he\u00a0&quot;slightly ran away&quot;, returned to England and did The Forsyte Saga. Since then, Lewis has worked enough in the US\u00a0to feel no particular culture gap with the American cast of Homeland. One of his favourite co-stars is Mandy Patinkin, whose brooding, agonised performance as Saul Berenson is perhaps as large a part of the show&apos;s success as the Carrie-Brody dynamic. Patinkin is a legend of musical theatre, and Lewis has modest ambitions in music; he likes to form amateur bands on set and has hung out with Patinkin, whom he finds &quot;funny, sincere. Outrageously talented. Hyperactive. And enjoying the time of his life. The sound recordist recorded us doing an a\u00a0cappella version of Bohemian Rhapsody. We were supposed to be doing some gritty interrogation scene and suddenly found ourselves singing show tunes.&quot; Patinkin kept correcting him. &quot;No, no no no, that third note&apos;s wrong. Da-DA-da.&quot; He laughs. &quot;I realised I was with the master. It wasn&apos;t just a singalong.&quot;     Lewis and his wife, the actor Helen McCrory, in Los Angeles earlier this year. Photograph: Getty Images    When Lewis&apos;s wife, the actor Helen McCrory, and their two children fly out to see him, they get out of town and do all the touristy things or hang out by the pool. &quot;It&apos;s a country club life. Pools and barbecues.&quot; It must be tough, the separation, but he says McCrory has been very good about it. &quot;Helen is incredibly generous and happy for me. She&apos;s phenomenal.&quot; Presumably the deal is that he would do the same for her? &quot;Weeelll... I&apos;m still the man of the house.&quot; He laughs. &quot;Helen is in fact about to do a\u00a0Showtime series called Penny Dreadful. And her involvement might be substantial. Don&apos;t know where they&apos;re filming yet, and she will go to it. We decided it was a great thing, by John Logan, a\u00a0fabulous writer, and Showtime is a fabulous place to be at the moment. She says no to a lot of things in order to be around as a mum. We both say no to more than we say yes to. But then you have to figure out a time when you&apos;re both around, otherwise you&apos;re always single parents. Quite difficult.&quot; The couple were living separately when she got\u00a0pregnant the first time. &quot;I never wanted to live with anyone,&quot; Lewis explains. &quot;I had never lived with anyone. So there was a lot of double toothbrushing. We had our two separate places. We should&apos;ve kept them!&quot; They wouldn&apos;t go the Helena Bonham Carter-Tim Burton route and have adjoining houses? &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want that. Well, sometimes. No. It&apos;s\u00a0important to have a big enough house in order to have space. And we&apos;re very lucky in that we were able to do that. Let&apos;s find a place and have a\u00a0baby; we did it all at the same time. That&apos;s a\u00a0little bit the way our lives are.&quot; He is locked into Homeland for seven seasons, which doesn&apos;t mean anything in terms of security. &quot;You have to sign up for a long time, then they&apos;ll\u00a0kill you at their leisure.&quot; In fact, he wouldn&apos;t be surprised if he got the chop relatively\u00a0soon. &quot;I think the writers are desperate to kill me. I&apos;m a pain in their arses, because Brody is quite a difficult character to write. There&apos;s a\u00a0high head count on Homeland. Any one of us could get it at any point.&quot; A pair of girls who have been watching him come up to the table and shyly ask for an autograph. Lewis obliges.

When he decided to return to Amsterdam, she was five and unprepared for her new life. She remembers looking out of the aeroplane window during its descent into Schiphol and thinking the lights below were &quot;stars that had fallen out of the sky and were scattered on the land&quot;. It took time to adjust. &quot;For a\u00a0year or so I felt like my real life was going on without me back in Africa and I was living this parallel life here. It was painful in a way, this feeling that I had left my home behind.&quot; We are sitting in Sassen&apos;s studio-cum-office situated up a tiny alley just off Prinsengracht. Save for a rug on which her five-year-old son Lucius&apos;s toys are scattered, the space is ordered and calm. In an adjacent room her partner, Hugo, and her assistant, Pef, field calls and organise her schedule. She is explaining how these formative memories, as well as the intense dreams that she still has about her childhood, have found creative expression in her photography. &quot;To me, Africa is vivid colours and strong contrasts of light and dark,&quot; she says. &quot;I remember looking at women and children sitting under the trees sheltering from the sun and, even as a child, seeing these graphic shapes.&quot; Sassen&apos;s photography is by turns beautiful and unsettling, characterised by disorientating formal experimentation. Although she now devotes more time to personal documentary projects, often involving travel to the remotest parts of Africa, she is best known as a fashion photographer who has built her reputation on breaking the rules. On 19 October a\u00a0retrospective of her commercial photography, Viviane Sassen: In and Out of Fashion, spanning the years 1998 to 2012, opens at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery . Like a handful of mavericks before her \u2013 Guy Bourdin and Juergen Teller spring to mind \u2013 Sassen has reinvented the form by following her instincts. What is striking about her images is that the clothes and the models are mere props for her imagination: a pair of legs stick through holes in a wall; a girl with a bright red face leans over on a pavement as if defying gravity. She uses mirrors, scissors, paint and Photoshop to mess with the viewer&apos;s preconceptions about what a fashion photograph is. It is a\u00a0long way from the glossiness of Vogue, closer to a post-digital photographic surrealism, though Sassen often still shoots on film and applies Photoshop &quot;in the most amateur and unfinished way&quot;. She is, she says, &quot;always impatient and eager to finish&quot; and finds the constraints of &quot;all the hair and make-up stuff&quot; too frustrating. &quot;Documentary and fashion are like the two sides of my personality,&quot; she says. &quot;Both are intuitive, but my personal work is more introverted and reflective. Plus it&apos;s just me and Hugo and maybe an assistant. With fashion, there can be 30 people on a set for a big campaign shoot. Mostly I prefer to work quickly with a small crew. It&apos;s about being energetic, extrovert and flamboyant. We just go crazy, and it&apos;s like I am in a trance. It&apos;s just go, go, go!&quot; Sassen is such a centred presence it&apos;s hard to imagine her thriving on this freneticism. She studied fashion at the Royal Academy in Arnhem and briefly became a model, working for Viktor &amp;\u00a0Rolf before she transferred to do a photography degree at Utrecht in 1992. &quot;I did my thesis on the photography book as a medium because I was so inspired by artists such as Nan Goldin, Larry Clark, Araki and Richard Billingham. People who make intimate documentary work about their own life on small cameras with great energy.&quot; Sassen used photography, she says, to explore her sexuality as a teenager, making nude portraits of herself, her boyfriends and female friends. &quot;I think that the experience I\u00a0had of being shot by male photographers shaped what I\u00a0was attempting to do, to show a different kind of sexuality than that created by the male gaze. One that is more fractured, disjointed. I have always been a very shy exhibitionist, &quot; she continues, laughing. &quot;Trying to hide but wanting to show.&quot; Sassen&apos;s work first appeared in the 2000s in a literary magazine called Austerlitz and a photography zine called SEC. &quot;There were all these crazy fashion magazines: Fantastic Man, Self-Service. I\u00a0just sent some of my work off to Purple Fashion magazine, and they published it.&quot; She worked with a pool of friends, including fellow photographer Emmeline de Mooij, who became her model, assistant, stylist and the first of several muses. &quot;We were working with simple ideas,&quot; remembers de Mooij in an interview for the In and Out of Fashion catalogue. &quot;It was all about form. For props we used ordinary household stuff; sometimes we bought flowers. We always worked intuitively.&quot; Now, it seems, she is frustrated by the conservatism of fashion photography even if she enjoys the freedom it&apos;s afforded her. &quot;For me, fashion is one big playground, a place to experiment,&quot; she says. &quot;But I have always had this love/hate thing with it. I don&apos;t really like the business side or the superficiality. You see more and more images of multiple models with multiple sunglasses and multiple bags. It&apos;s all product, product, product and not much creativity.&quot; One of the best ways to appreciate Sassen&apos;s work is through her photobooks. Flamboya merges documentary and fine art to find a new way of looking at Africa, one that is neither exoticising nor straightforward reportage. Parasomnia is a more dreamlike exploration of Africa that draws on those childhood memories and vivid dreams. She shows me new black-and-white images from a trip to Surinam that merge landscape, observation and staged portraits of her latest muse, a young man called Etan. She seems to be moving further away from fashion towards a kind of heightened documentary, where atmosphere and mystery are key elements. &quot;Definitely,&quot; she says, smiling. &quot;The title, Parasomnia, is a\u00a0term for sleep disorders \u2013 sleepwalking, sleep talking, night terrors.

Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG) has agreed a joint venture with Manchester Airports Group (MAG), UK construction group Carillion, and the Greater Manchester Pension Fund on the development which is expected to create around 16,000 new jobs and attract international businesses. The deal was announced by the chancellor, George Osborne, who is in China on a five-day trade mission. The area surrounding Manchester airport will become Britain&apos;s first &quot;airport city&quot; and include 5m sq ft of offices, hotels, advanced manufacturing space, logistics and warehousing. MAG began its search for joint venture partners at the end of 2012 and said it had sought companies which could bring global development expertise as well as access to international tenants and financing capabilities. It is hoped the scheme will compete with European airport city developments such as in Barcelona and Amsterdam. &quot;The inclusion of BCEG is significant because as a group, we have been keen to forge greater links with the far east and this gives us an opportunity to strengthen vital business links with China,&quot; said Charlie Cornish, chief executive of MAG. Outline planning permission for the project was granted at the beginning of 2013, and construction work is expected to start by the end of the year. The scheme will be built over the next 15 years.

Two men barged into the home of Onno Elderenbosch, the Dutch deputy head of mission in Russia, and beat him, tied him up with tape and drew a heart pierced with an arrow on his mirror in pink lipstick and beneath it the letters LGBT, the acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. The Russian foreign ministry said authorities would &quot;take all measures&quot; to find those responsible, working in close partnership with the Dutch, but the incident looks certain to worsen fraying ties between the countries, with the king and queen of the Netherlands due to visit Russia next month. Upon returning home on Tuesday night Elderenbosch found that the lift in his apartment building was not working and encountered two men posing as electricians, according to Russian media reports. They reportedly asked to check his fourth-floor apartment for electricity, and when he opened the door they overpowered him and forced their way inside. Elderenbosch, 60, sustained minor injuries in the incident. The intruders stole nothing. Ten days earlier Dutch police arrested Elderenbosch&apos;s opposite number, Dmitry Borodin, the number two in the Russian embassy in the Hague, despite him having diplomatic immunity. Borodin, who says he was beaten with a police baton, was detained for three hours on 5 October in an incident that Vladimir Putin said violated the Vienna convention. The Russian president demanded a public apology, subsequently issued by the Dutch foreign minister, Frans Timmermans. But the Netherlands declined to bring any police officers to account. According to Dutch media reports cited by the AFP news agency, Borodin was found drunk and barely able to stand when police arrived at his home after neighbours complained he was mistreating his children. Russia has rubbished these reports. In the wake of the incident an aide to Gennady Onishchenko, the chief health inspector known for banning produce from countries at odds with the Kremlin, threatened to impose an import ban on Dutch tulips and dairy products. Ties between the Netherlands and Russia began to fray conspicuously in September when border guards seized a Dutch-flagged Greenpeace ship that activists used for an environmental protest on an oil rig operated by the Russian state gas giant Gazprom in the Arctic Pechora Sea. On 4 October the Dutch launched legal proceedings against Russia, hoping to go to the international tribunal for the law of the sea, based in Hamburg, to contest the manner by which Russian border guards seized the Arctic Sunrise in international waters. The Greenpeace activists, among them two Dutch nationals, have been charged with piracy, which carries 10 to 15 years in jail in Russia. They could face further charges after investigators claimed they found illegal substances on board the boat. A court in Murmansk, northern Russia, has so far rejected all appeals for bail. Dutch politicians have said they hope legal proceedings will draw further attention to the charges, which have been criticised as baseless. It is not the first time diplomats have encountered problems in Russia. Britain&apos;s former ambassador Anthony Brenton was hounded for months in 2006 by members of a pro-Kremlin youth group after the murder of Alexander Litvinenko led to a spate of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions between the UK and Russia. The current US ambassador, Michael McFaul, has complained that pro-government television crews have displayed an uncanny knowledge of his movements, suggesting they are able to monitor his phone calls and email correspondence. On Wednesday McFaul condemned the attack of Elderenbosch, writing on Twitter that &quot;such actions are unacceptable&quot;. Russia&apos;s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was reported to have spoken to his Dutch counterpart by telephone on Wednesday evening to inform him of progress in the investigation, although no details were forthcoming. As well as the Greenpeace incident, Russia and the Netherlands have been at odds over LGBT issues this year. When Putin flew to Amsterdam in April, thousands waved rainbow flags in Amsterdam to protest against Russian legislation prohibiting the distribution of &quot;gay propaganda&quot; among minors. In July four Dutch nationals who were producing a film about LGBT rights were detained by police in the Russian north and questioned for several hours before being released. They were subsequently banned from returning to Russia for three years, purportedly because they had violated their visa regulations. They are believed to be the first foreigners to have crossed paths with the legislation. Dutch politicians have urged King Willem-Alexander to cancel his planned visit next month. The king is due in Russia to mark the end of a bilateral project called &quot;Netherlands-Russia year&quot;, designed to mark 400 years of relations between the two countries. On Wednesday Dutch politicians called for the project to be abandoned entirely.", "sentences": ["When Putin flew to Amsterdam in April, thousands waved rainbow flags in Amsterdam to protest against Russian legislation prohibiting the distribution of &quot;gay propaganda&quot; among minors."], "title": "Attack on diplomat in Moscow deepens Dutch-Russian rift", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/16/moscow-assault-dutch-diplomat", "tags": ["Russia", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-17T06:00:00Z", "article": "I&apos;ll tell you what&apos;s wrong with the\u00a0conversation about housing \u2013 we all know there&apos;s a market failure. Any market of essential goods that most people can&apos;t afford is a failure. But, in still talking about it entirely as individuals who are unable to buy what they want, we contain ourselves within a relatively small consumer space. We fight the logic of the market with the logic of \u2026 consumers who can&apos;t afford the market. But what we&apos;re really looking at is a crisis of civic space as much as a crisis of personal space. The library I learned to read in, and where I had my first Saturday job, has been turned into a prep school. For stupid, sentimental reasons, this saddens me far more than if it had turned into flats. Spaces aren&apos;t being distributed away from all children towards rich adults, they&apos;re being taken away from all children and given to rich children. The same local authority, along with many others, is talking about selling its town hall. It&apos;s entirely reasonable. Think how many flats you could get into one of those buildings, and how majestic their windows would be. It would solve a lot of financial crises (at least for a fortnight) in one knock, if those employees could just work from home. The entailments for local democracy would be seismic and irreversible, but it would be hard to put an actual cash value on them. The cash value of the land, meanwhile, is very easily established \u2013 and it&apos;s massive. Local government has seemed so boring for so long that I thought that nothing they could do would be as bad as having to listen to them deciding whether to do it. I&apos;ve shaken that off now. They could do some terrible things and it wouldn&apos;t even be their fault. Naturally, this comes back to a property bubble, and the buck ends with a London property bubble. It may not seem important if you&apos;re outside London but it is, for two reasons. First, &quot;London&quot;, in terms of land values, will soon translate as &quot;anywhere that is commutable to London&quot;. Second, the next general election wouldn&apos;t be the first that politicians have fought entirely\u00a0on the economics of the capital city, and it won&apos;t be the last. The sheer, dysfunctional exclusivity of the London housing market is obvious to everyone: the fact that the coalition, with its Help to Buy scheme, is answering a crisis of affordability by shovelling more money at the richest people they can find merely reflects the\u00a0intensity of their conservatism. It\u00a0does not suggest that they&apos;re not aware there&apos;s a problem. Everybody knows there&apos;s a problem. David Cameron denies this will create a bubble, saying that he&apos;s empowered the Bank of England to stop a bubble being created. This is a little bit like saying you&apos;ve empowered the Bank&apos;s governor, Mark Carney, to stop it raining. If the debt needed to buy a house is far more than most earn, the ratio of household debt to GDP will be very high, and banks will be over-leveraged. These are the preconditions for a housing bubble. This isn&apos;t the view of Marxist economists, it&apos;s the view of as mainstream a figure as this year&apos;s Nobel prizewinner in economics, Robert Shiller. But there is a reason why Cameron is so unruffled by the idea of a bubble, even if it&apos;s not his given reason: there is a perception \u2013 which is not, in the short-term, unfounded \u2013 that the bubble in the south-east cannot burst. The reason is foreign investment, which runs all the way from the premium properties (75% of central London newbuilds are sold abroad before they even appear on the UK market), to typically undervalued areas, like Brixton in south London, where an estate agent told me recently: &quot;It&apos;s actually not so much young professionals, it&apos;s foreign investment, buy-to-lets.&quot; Since people still need to live in the capital, those still almost able to buy are shunted further out, and even quite distant towns take on the glister of London prices. None of this means the bubble won&apos;t burst eventually, but it does mean it will take longer than the 18 months we have to go until the election, and that when it does, the bust probably won&apos;t function in the classic way. The house price crash of the early 1990s meant the genuine degradation of capital. Mortgage companies had fire sales and houses were auctioned, sometimes for less than they were worth. The spectacle was appalling, as well-intentioned people who&apos;d thought they were being responsible and far-sighted were suddenly homeless. And yet the result was that, by the mid-90s, property was affordable again. Set this against the 2007/8 sub-prime housing crash, which impacted on London prices for about five minutes. Governments now believe that London can no longer go bust. This is probably untrue; anywhere can go bust. The Herengracht Canal index is a record of house prices on Amsterdam&apos;s most prestigious waterway. Economists love it because it goes back to 1628. But it gives you that Ozymandias feeling; once upon a time, that was Park Lane. Nowhere stays Park Lane forever. But if we always insulate ourselves against a bust we will, quite quickly, price ourselves out of civic space. So, sure, we need to build more houses. We all agree on that, apart from\u00a0\u2013 bizarrely \u2013 the people in charge. But at some point we also have to articulate the point of collective ownership, and this will inevitably entail articulating where and why developers aren&apos;t welcome, which will become where and why the investment of rest of the world isn&apos;t welcome. Either that, or remake a capital elsewhere.

In The Secret History, the one-page prologue gives us a murder and a narrator who has helped to commit it. The Little Friend starts with the death of a child who, by page 15, is found hanging by a\u00a0piece of rope from a tree branch, his red hair &quot;the only thing about him that\u00a0was the right colour any more&quot;. And now, in The Goldfinch, Tartt has a 50\u2011page two-part opening. In the first section, the narrator, Theo Decker, is\u00a0holed up in an Amsterdam hotel, looking at newspapers written in Dutch, which he can&apos;t understand; he\u00a0is searching for his name in articles illustrated with pictures of police cars and crime scene tapes. Before any of this is explained, the story moves back 14\u00a0years to the day Theo&apos;s mother dies, when he is on the cusp of adolescence. Her death takes place in New York&apos;s Metropolitan Museum, as a consequence of an exploding bomb \u2013 mother and son are in separate rooms when the bomb blast occurs, and the descriptions of Theo regaining consciousness in the wreckage, and trying to find his way out of the ripped-apart museum before returning home, expecting to find his mother there, are\u00a0written in astonishingly gripping prose. This is, of course, where the danger comes in: if, at the end of the kind of set piece to which the word &quot;climactic&quot; should emphatically apply, you still have 700 pages to go, aren&apos;t you setting your readers up for disappointment? Astonishingly, the answer is no. The novel changes gear and, for a while, is primarily involved with showing us, affectingly, the dislocation of Theo&apos;s life \u2013 a dislocation both emotional and physical. His mother dead, his father long absent, he finds himself living with the Barbours, the family of a\u00a0school friend; this is understood by everyone to be a short-term option, and the cold spectre of unknown and unloving grandparents who will eventually become Theo&apos;s guardians hovers over the novel for a time until his father reappears, with his girlfriend Xandra, and takes Theo off to live with him in Las Vegas. There will be more twists and turns in this tale of a\u00a0motherless boy whose life involves dramatic changes and is peopled with a\u00a0vast cast of characters, many of whose affections and intentions it isn&apos;t\u00a0easy to work out. If there&apos;s any one novel this strand of the story calls to mind, it&apos;s Great Expectations \u2013 there&apos;s even a character called Pippa, perhaps a playful melding of Pip and Estella. Pippa, near Theo in age, was also in the\u00a0museum when the bomb exploded, and is the only person who Theo feels can understand his heart. But there is a second strand to the novel, this one with echoes of Crime and Punishment. Young Theo Decker enters a museum with his mother; he\u00a0leaves with a painting. The painting \u2013 one that actually exists in the world \u2013 is The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius, a\u00a0student of Rembrandt&apos;s, who died at\u00a0the age of 32 when a gunpowder factory near his studio exploded. Almost all his work was destroyed; The\u00a0Goldfinch is widely considered the finest of the paintings that survived. &quot;Anything we manage to save from history is a miracle,&quot; Theo&apos;s mother says to him, minutes before her death \u2013 an idea that runs deep in the veins of\u00a0the novel. Picking up the painting from the debris and walking out of the museum with it isn&apos;t exactly theft, not if theft involves the conscious decision to steal. Theo is acting in a state of mental distress, on the instructions of\u00a0a dying man who tells him to take the painting. This man, it so happens, is guardian to Pippa \u2013 at this point, she\u00a0is\u00a0nothing more to Theo than an arresting-looking girl, all too briefly glimpsed, though, later, their lives will collide and separate, repeatedly. But once Theo reads in the newspaper that the painting is believed to have been destroyed in the explosion, he chooses to keep quiet about his possession of it \u2013 and from here on, he\u00a0is culpable. As the years go on, both Theo&apos;s attachment to the painting (a\u00a0thing of beauty, but also a physical connection to one of the last conversations he had with his mother) and his guilt over his continued possession of such a priceless work of art grows. So, too, does his fear of being imprisoned for stealing the object. It should come as no surprise, in a novel that opens with crime scene tapes and exploding museums, that the story of Theo and the painting is a story of betrayal, suspicion, double-dealing and shoot-outs. Raymond Chandler is no less a\u00a0presence here than Dickens and Dostoyevsky. To say any more about the events of the novel would be to deprive a reader of the great joy of being swept up by the plot. If anyone has lost their love of storytelling, The\u00a0Goldfinch should most certainly return it to them. The novel isn&apos;t, of course, all action and suspense. Some of its most memorable moments occur in stillness. Take Theo&apos;s first experience of the desert skies of Las\u00a0Vegas, after a life spent amid the light pollution of New York. Until now, he has only known the constellations as &quot;childhood patterns that had twinkled me to sleep from the glow-in\u2011the-dark planetarium stars on my bedroom ceiling back in New York. Now, transfigured \u2013 cold and glorious like deities with their disguises flung off \u2013 it was as if they&apos;d flown through the roof and into the sky to assume their true, celestial homes.&quot; It is a\u00a0glorious piece of prose, but placed within a novel about a boy who has lost his true home \u2013 which is, wherever his mother might be \u2013 it becomes heart-piercing, too. Tartt may already have displayed her great gift for plot in her debut, but the emotional register of The Goldfinch is of a different order from either of her previous works. It would be wrong, however, to think that all the emotions are centred around loss. At the heart of the novel is\u00a0an\u00a0evocation of boyhood friendship \u2013 that of Theo and Boris, the\u00a0Ukrainian outsider he meets on his first day of\u00a0school in Las Vegas. Boris is an unforgettable creation \u2013 a thieving, drinking, drug-taking teenager who lights up each page he is on, even as he\u00a0leads Theo into a world of excess. Their relationship works so well on the\u00a0page in part because it has been prefigured by Theo&apos;s friendship, in New\u00a0York, with a boy called Tom Cable \u2013 a friendship with a &quot;wild, manic quality, something unhinged and hectic and a little perilous about it&quot;. Tartt doesn&apos;t present Theo as\u00a0someone who comes unmoored from his own character by the death of his mother, but, more convincingly, as a\u00a0boy whose\u00a0flaws become more deeply inscribed in him as a consequence of\u00a0loss. Then again, it\u00a0is not entirely right to think of Theo&apos;s friendship with Boris\u00a0as a flaw \u2013 the love between the boys is both simple and complicated, in the way of the best friendships. And\u00a0when Boris re-enters Theo&apos;s life in adulthood it is impossible not to hope he is there as a friend, even while fearing the opposite. Plot and character and fine prose can\u00a0take you far \u2013 but a novel this good makes you want to go even further. The last few pages of the novel take all\u00a0the serious, big, complicated ideas beneath the surface and hold them up to the light. Not for Tartt the kind of clever riffs, halfway between standup comedy and op-ed columns, which are too commonly found in contemporary fiction. Instead, when plot comes to an end, she leads us to\u00a0a\u00a0place just beyond it \u2013 a\u00a0place of\u00a0meaning, or, as she refers to it, &quot;a\u00a0rainbow edge \u2026 where all art exists, and all magic. And \u2026 all love.&quot; \u2022 Kamila Shamsie&apos;s most recent book is Burnt Shadows (Bloomsbury)", "sentences": ["In the first section, the narrator, Theo Decker, is\u00a0holed up in an Amsterdam hotel, looking at newspapers written in Dutch, which he can&apos;t understand; he\u00a0is searching for his name in articles illustrated with pictures of police cars and crime scene tapes."], "title": "The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/17/goldfinch-donna-tartt-review", "tags": ["Donna Tartt", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-17T13:11:45Z", "article": "Funny old thing, that James Bond. Though Ian Fleming died in 1964, his hero has had a charmed existence since, newly incarnated in a variety of actors and films, and in further Bond adventures written by Kingsley Amis, John Gardner, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver and, now, William Boyd. Of these, Boyd seems the best choice. He has a sophisticated interest in the world of espionage, a fluent prose style, and a crisp eye for a Bondish detail. He was pictured, on publication week, in front of one of seven vintage Jensens, each of which was to deliver a copy of Solo, his new Bond novel, to Heathrow, from where they would be flown to various destinations associated with Bond (or Boyd). What will happen to the books in Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Zurich, New Delhi, Los Angeles, Cape Town and Sydney was not announced. Nothing very exciting, I presume. Standing in front of one of the cars, with young women dressed up as glamorous British Airways flight attendants, Boyd looked mildly bemused at this exuberant silliness, but was joining in with characteristic good humour. I read all of the Bond books more or less as they came out (in paperback) and was, at the time, a devoted fan. James Bond was, to my American eye and ear, an immensely sophisticated Brit. He could be relied upon to defeat villains, bed any pretty girl, and eat and drink to a standard one could only learn from. Shaken, not stirred: must remember \u2026 The films, too, imprinted themselves on my memory: Ursula Andress emerging from the sea; Goldfinger, Oddjob and the poor dead, gilded girl; Pussy Galore and her lesbian acrobats. Sean Connery was an exemplary Bond, and while both Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan made a decent fist of following up, Daniel Craig seems more an automaton than a flesh and blood hero. The films became increasingly reliant on special effects, with ludicrously extended chases of one sort or another, more like video games than movies; an arcade experience, not a cinematic one. In the first edition market, the Bond books occupy an interesting and in some respects unparalleled place. In my Catalogue Number 1 (1982), as item 37, I listed an extensive Fleming collection, which consisted of all 14 novels, in nice condition in their original dust wrappers, with 22 further Fleming items. I priced it at \u00a31,385, and remember counselling one of my customers not to buy it at what seemed to me rather a high price. The books, I observed, were only a bit of popular culture, unlikely to last, and very likely to be hyped while the Bond phenomenon was still bubbling away. I remember saying something similar about the early inflation of the prices of the Harry Potter books, which have \u2013 like the Bonds \u2013 continued to rise steeply. I am not a very good judge of this market. The Fleming collection \u2013 which I had purchased from Iain Sinclair before he became a well-known novelist (he spent a lot of his time then as a book scout) \u2013 didn&apos;t find a buyer, and I had to break it up, ensuring a considerable Fleming inventory for the next few years. If someone had bought it, it would have been a bargain. The prices for the Bond novels have escalated remarkably since then. I recently saw a copy of Casino Royale (the first novel) in beautiful condition offered at \u00a350,000, and myself sold an equally pristine copy of Live and Let Die (the second) for \u00a317,000. I wasn&apos;t particularly happy dabbling once again in the Bond market, but I was asked to source some of the books by a collector-friend, and that, after all, is what a rare book dealer is supposed to do. My 1982 offering would now be worth at least \u00a375,000, and I would hesitate to dissuade any prospective customer from buying Bond books, which increase in value year upon year. The process has recently been reflected in \u2013 and perhaps enhanced by \u2013 the issue of a magisterial bibliography of Fleming by the bookseller John Gilbert. It&apos;s a lavish, outsized, handsomely comprehensive account of the books, which in itself might be thought of as a collector&apos;s item. Originally published at \u00a3175, it is a companion worthy of its hero. If you look at the price trajectory of the Bond books in tandem with other first editions over the same period, there is hardly any comparison. My 1982 catalogue had a lot of nice things, which would be worth a lot more today. It included a copy of Journey of the Magi coolly inscribed by TS Eliot to his first wife \u2013 &quot;VHE from TSE 1927&quot; (\u00a3775, now perhaps \u00a315,000) \u2013 as well as the corrected typescript of Virginia Woolf&apos;s Freshwater (\u00a34,250 then, perhaps \u00a330,000 now). Both of these items are unique and important, and both need to be described and analysed with care so that their full significance can be understood. They are, in their own modest ways, part of literary history. Whereas my little Fleming collection had nothing special about it: none of the books were signed or inscribed by their author, there were no letters or manuscripts. Just a bunch of books, of the kind that I suspect you could duplicate with an hour&apos;s work on abebooks.com and a very fat wallet. I do not know why prices of the Bond books have escalated so substantially over the past 30 years. Partly it is a market phenomenon: a lot more people read the Bond novels than Eliot or Woolf, and if a set percentage of the readership becomes collectors, there will always be more demand for the Bond books than those by highbrow literary writers. But the same is true of Barbara Cartland, and nobody collects her. Like Sherlock Holmes, Bond is not merely a hero, but an archetype. Unlike the ultimate reasoning machine, Bond is an embodiment of the man of action, fit for any purpose, the ultimate answer to the manifold faces of evil. That the collecting market should respond to such figures (in children&apos;s literature think of Christopher Robin or Bilbo Baggins) is understandable enough. Collectors pursue a wide variety of agendas, but one of them is undoubtedly the (often unconscious) search for a figure with whom to identify, or one who touches some nostalgic chord. In the meantime, the new Boyd/Bond is very enjoyable, with a full canvas of gruesome murders, hideous villains, sexy lovers and switched identities.

This year, passengers on the King Seaways ferry that runs daily between Newcastle and Amsterdam made a record 699 sightings in the five months to 5 September , four times as many as 2011 and over three times as many as 2012. Minke whales, four species of dolphins, harbour porpoises, sharks, seals, and even a humpback whale were spotted. But wildlife experts from the charity Orca, who accompany most North Sea crossings and verify the sightings made by passengers, say that it&apos;s unlikely that the heavily fished sea is actually more populated with cetaceans than in previous years, and more likely down to increasing numbers of observers. &quot;We think it&apos;s a case of the more eyes the better,&quot; said Alison Lomax, head of Orca&apos;s North Sea wildlife programme. &quot;At times we have had 30 or more people scanning the sea from the bows of the ferry. People are now much more aware of wildlife. So they look more and see more. We&apos;ve had evenings when whole pods of dolphins have been turning up, and we have sightings every few minutes.&quot; Whale and dolphin boat trips are now thriving tourist industries in Cornwall, Wales and Scotland, but few operate out of the North Sea, which is traditionally rough. Whale watching boats work out of Whitby but going by ferry across the North Sea appeals, it seems, because watchers can always pop indoors when they like for a cuppa when it inevitably rains. The best sightings this year have been 30km off Flamborough Head in Yorkshire. &quot;You really don&apos;t think of the North Sea as somewhere which is full of wildlife. But it has been really speactacular. There&apos;s loads to see. You would be very surprised,&quot; said Lomax. This year&apos;s good weather is thought to have helped, too. &quot;Porpoises and dolphins don&apos;t spout so they are really only seen when it&apos;s calm. They are really hard to spot in bad weather. The amazingly calm weather has had a huge impact on the number of animals we have seen. This summer we were treated to mirror-calm seas, making the animals much easier to spot.&quot; The sightings complement the official scientific surveys that are carried out by wildlife officers from Orca who travel on the ferry twice a month. &quot;The passengers provide casual data, but it&apos;s incredibly important in helping us to monitor the presence of whales and dolphins in the North Sea,&quot; Lomax added.", "sentences": ["This year, passengers on the King Seaways ferry that runs daily between Newcastle and Amsterdam made a record 699 sightings in the five months to 5 September , four times as many as 2011 and over three times as many as 2012."], "title": "Record whale and dolphin sightings in North Sea", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/18/record-whale-dolphin-sightings-north-sea", "tags": ["Whales", "Marine life", "Environment", "UK news", "Wildlife", "Animals", "World news", "Dolphins", "Cetaceans"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-18T22:11:36Z", "article": "Staring at a nondescript brick wall in the west of Amsterdam, a clue to the great English coaching conundrum stares you in the face. The wall is outside Dennis Bergkamp&apos;s childhood home, in a modest apartment block around the corner from a canal in Bos en Lommer. It was here that the young Bergkamp refined his technique with the kind of specifics that would not occur to most footballers. He worked his technique with such precision he would aim for a corner of a particular brick, time and again, with different pace and power and spin to see how it changed the ball&apos;s trajectory and challenged his ability to tame it. It was fitting somehow that Bergkamp returned to this spiritual spot to talk about his philosophy. The pursuit of control in football inspires him as much today as a coach with Ajax as it did when he was on the pitch as a player trying to change games with a flawless moment. Control is so much his obsession that he is completely frank when he says he prefers the first touch that started any of his most memorable goals than the strike that finished them. Others might say that, but it is doubtful they really mean it. Bergkamp does. The glory, for him, is all about control and touch. Can that be taught? &quot;The basics for me is the first touch,&quot; he says, as if a perfect first touch is some kind of alchemy. &quot;First touch in football is so important. If you talk about Mesut \u00d6zil people say he is not marked properly, he always has a lot of space but he has got that space because he can create space by his vision and his first touch. With that you create your own time.&quot; It is quite an arresting concept, creating time with a moving ball. &quot;Teach that to children,&quot; he says. &quot;Do something with the ball, let it bounce, back, back, back against the wall, left, right, that&apos;s the main thing.&quot; The business of establishing technique fascinates him. It is a subject he elaborates on in his illuminating book, Stillness and Speed. On the subject of how young players are &quot;over-coached&quot; nowadays, he becomes animated about getting the right balance between teaching young players, and allowing them freedom to express themselves. &quot;If I look at my coaches in the youth at Ajax, with all due respect they were two elderly men who would stand at the side of the pitch, shouting a few things,&quot; he says. &quot;So in a way you create your own career, you create your own development, and that helps you later on. Whereas now there are a lot of coaches, everyone has got their badge, they all think they are Mourinho or Wenger, even with the 12- to 13-year-olds. &quot;They know exactly what to do, what kind of exercises they have to do with the kids, and in a way they don&apos;t have to think for themselves any more. It is all done for them. It&apos;s a problem because they don&apos;t think for themselves. If they get a new situation, they look to someone as if to say, &apos;What do I have to do now?&apos; I believe that is over-coaching. It&apos;s too much. Let them have their freedom. You have to create the environment where they can be unique and not a clone.&quot; Bergkamp is not a fan of the way youth football in England is results-orientated. &quot;You have to win these games, so the coach is going to manage to win the game instead of developing the player. In my opinion it should be totally the opposite. Sometimes you put your strongest player on the bench just to let others shine. Or you put a right-footed player who can&apos;t do anything with his left on the left side and force him to use his left foot. Of course in that game you will probably lose because you don&apos;t use your strongest players in their strongest position, but in the end you have a player who used his left foot when he was 12 and 13 and 14, and he can use both feet when he comes into the first team. That&apos;s what we have at Ajax and I really stand behind that.&quot; Bergkamp was in a way a reluctant coach. He found it difficult to adjust his thinking \u2013 a player used to the highest technical standards working with aspiring players who were not at his level. &quot;I struggled a bit,&quot; he confessed. &quot;You look at a player and think, &apos;Why can&apos;t you control that ball?&apos; But you have to take a few steps back.&quot; He still enjoys demonstrating during coaching sessions, although he blushes and sounds slightly reproachful that he cannot be &quot;explosive&quot; any more. &quot;There are times not to coach,&quot; he says. &quot;You have to be balanced to know that. The urge is to step in and show how good you are as a coach and show you know everything and you can tell them. Sometimes it is better to let them make a mistake. Sometimes they learn more from that than being told what to do.&quot; Seeking out beauty and refinement in football still excites him. He sees it in Lionel Messi, obviously, but also picks out \u00d6zil, who is expected to be fit to face Norwich today, as a player he is particularly captivated by. Does he see some of himself in the German playmaker? &quot;I do,&quot; says Bergkamp, with the caveat that he is not fond of comparisons. &quot;The way he is finding his space, in his free role, and his first touch is fantastic. I really enjoy him. The main thing now is that he will bring more to Arsenal, and push them towards victories, towards trophies.&quot; He reckons something has changed to make for &quot;a different Arsenal&quot; this season. &quot;It looks fresh, sharp, a lot of good movement, it feels like \u2013 also because Mesut came \u2013 there is an awareness they can do something. Maybe that was the missing link.&quot; While Bergkamp rules out a future in management, he has not been shy about his aim to one day be part of the coaching set up at Arsenal. English football still gets him to the core. The marriage of aesthetic and hectic is perfect in his eyes. &quot;For me, that is beauty,&quot; he says. &quot;I saw Arsenal against Spurs. The pace of the game was incredible. An hour later I watched a Dutch game, and there is no point. It was so slow. A lot of things are happening in English football, openings, the high pace, that is beauty too.&quot; Dennis Bergkamp, Stillness and Speed (Simon and Schuster)", "sentences": ["Staring at a nondescript brick wall in the west of Amsterdam, a clue to the great English coaching conundrum stares you in the face."], "title": "Dennis Bergkamp on Arsenal, aesthetics and a blueprint for British coaching", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/18/dennis-bergkamp-arsenal-british-coaching", "tags": ["Arsenal", "Ajax", "Holland", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-19T23:01:04Z", "article": "The article on marmosets used in experiments at King&apos;s College London (&quot;The ethics of animal tests: inside the lab where marmosets are given Parkinson&apos;s&quot;, News) painted a remarkably positive picture of life in the laboratory ahead of the series of debates sponsored by a pro-vivisection lobby group. They might be fed marshmallows and have knitted hammocks, but the brain-poisoned marmosets are also left essentially paralysed, mute, rigid and unable to groom or feed themselves. Yet the result is no more than a crude and simplistic model of Parkinson&apos;s disease that is completely unreliable in predicting human outcomes. Contrary to the extraordinary claims quoted in this article, today&apos;s most successful treatments for Parkinson&apos;s (levodopa, selegiline and apomorphine) were pioneered in human trials. Indeed, it is only by focusing on non-animal research that we can hope to move from treating Parkinson&apos;s disease to curing it.

When the believer says &quot;it feels&quot; or &quot;I feel that&quot; (and then expresses a fact or thought rather than a feeling), they are masking their true feelings and voicing their opinion. The device is useful as &quot;I feel&quot; is difficult to argue with. The skill of unpacking beliefs, thoughts and opinions masquerading as feelings would promote an honest exchange of views and values. The real feelings of fear, anger, frustration and resentment that lie behind the public&apos;s reported opinions could be addressed openly and may even lead to honest debate. Dr Anne Brockbank London N1 Do try to contain yourself A very interesting article from Harriet Meyer about the use of shipping containers as homes to battle the housing supply crises (&quot;Would-be buyers home in on the DIY solution to Britain&apos;s housing crisis&quot;, Cash). However, this is nothing new. For many years, shipping containers have been used to house students in Amsterdam. For instance, there&apos;s Wenckenhof, a student campus consisting of 1,000 containers. The containers have all the mod-cons, plus a balcony or garden, and are indeed fun and comfortable to live in, judging by the long waiting list. Willem de Blaauw Amsterdam New meaning to a close shave Perhaps Jonathan Franzen (&quot;The Kraus Project&quot;, New Review) might have done better to quote a snappier Karl Kraus prediction of our mobile phone intoxication. In 1909, in an essay called Reforms, Kraus re-enacts the advent of the safety razor to exemplify a modernist &quot;reform&quot;. As the new gadget privatises the function of shaving and removes it from the social encounter of the barber&apos;s shop, he mock-laments the spiritual void of the customer deprived of the barber&apos;s pamperings and chatter, but proposes a mock-resolution: the invention of a talking razor, capable, at the press of a button, of reciting all the unsolicited pleasantries of a barber \u2013 the stuff that was anathema to the satirist. Who says Kraus wasn&apos;t a modernist? Gilbert Carr Stillorgan, Co Dublin Not easy to save the children Your letters page headline was half right (&quot;We all have a duty to step in when the young are in danger&quot;, Big Issue). In the immediate postwar period, the general public still felt a collective duty towards local children. Consider how different things may have been for poor James Bulger \u2013 and his abductors \u2013 had several adults challenged them. By then, however, the disastrously counterproductive &quot;Stranger Danger&quot; campaign had resulted in most adults choosing to keep away from any children unknown to them. Fearing false accusation, adults still stay aloof even when a child might possibly be in danger. It is not easy to see how some form of in loco parentis can be restored. Alan Hallsworth (professor emeritus) Portsmouth BBC can learn from X Factor Barbara Ellen rightly applauds the broad ethnic mix of ITV&apos;s The X Factor (&quot;Huge plaudits for the X-Factor&apos;s colour-blindness&quot;, Comment).

Photograph: Getty Images    When did Halloween get so scary? I mean properly scary, as opposed to just a bit spooky. It&apos;s as if, after years of reluctantly carving out pumpkins for our kids while mumbling about how commercialised it&apos;s all become, the adults have decided they want a slice of the action, too. How else to explain the recent proliferation of experiences aimed squarely at the over-18s? So-called &quot;scare attractions&quot; are now such big business they even have their own Oscars, the Scare Awards (also known as the Screamies). One of last year&apos;s winners, Cursed (thecursed.co.uk), describes itself as the &quot;ultimate horror destination in Essex&quot; (I\u00a0thought that was Brentwood High Street on a Saturday night). The Halloween pop-up promises to scare visitors &quot;witless&quot; with a live action &quot;horror maze&quot;. Meanwhile, at the Frightmare Halloween Festival in Gloucestershire (frightmare.co.uk) you can take part in a\u00a0&quot;haunted hayride&quot; or zombie paintball. More mainstream attractions have had to up the ante, too. Mask making and apple bobbing have been replaced by scary experiences such as spending the night in the London Dungeon in Mrs Lovett&apos;s &quot;meat pie&quot; shop (wimdu.co.uk), or taking an underground boat tour of the Dudley canal network in search of paranormal activity (dudleycanaltrust.org.uk). After years of being a\u00a0Halloween refusenik I\u00a0have decided to embrace the festival. After all, it&apos;s the only thing that stands between us and the carnival of consumerism that is Christmas. Now that really is terrifying.

Here&apos;s a roundup of what you were reading last week: VelmaNebraska:  I&apos;ve just finished reading Spirit House by Mark Dapin. The main plot is set in Bondi Beach in 1990 but it is essentially about the experiences of an Australian Jewish PoW who worked on the Thai-Burma railway during WWII. Toward the end of his life, he crawls out of a post-traumatic drunken haze and tells his grandson the story while trying to exorcise the ghosts of his past. There is no doubt that this is a carefully researched book and the characterisations are sharply imagined. But I found the first person voices completely unconvincing (and the narrative and its construction largely revolved around them in a variety of forms). Everybody seemed to use language like a novelist - or, rather, the person who wrote this novel (and while he has a lovely way with words, I simply didn&apos;t believe that these would be the words used by a 13 year old boy).  TimHannigan:  Thanks to kushti&apos;s convincing recommendation I bought myself a copy of Train Dreams by Denis Johnson. It was a book I knew nothing about, and had kushti not recommended it to me it might have passed me by - thank you kushti; I owe you for wonderful couple of hours&apos; reading. It fitted very well into my current diet of Very Short Books (116 pages of biggish type), and I read it in one sitting. It is a strange and wonderful thing, a hundred-page epic. There are crystalline details of the mundane; pieces of memory fixed in glass; and sudden departures into the unearthly. There&apos;s an obvious comparison to be made with Cormac McCarthy in the subject matter. But weirdly I found myself making a much more unlikely connection with another purveyor of miniature epics - Bruce Chatwin. There are curious echoes of both On the Black Hill, with its seemingly relaxed and expansive yet, in terms of pagination incredibly concise, account of rural life across decades, and of The Viceroy of Ouidah - which is up for a reread on my Very Short Books list, as it happens...  samofthepryce:  I&apos;m around 75 pages into Morrissey&apos;s Autobiography. Deliciously melancholic so far, with that familiar narcissism and pretension integral to the Moz we all know and love/hate (but secretly love).  Jenny Bhatt:  I started Oscar Hijuelos&apos; The Mambo Kings this week - in honor of his passing away a few days ago. Still reading the lovely A Book of One&apos;s Own by Thomas Mallon. I savor a few pages every day as I almost don&apos;t want it to end. Then I tell myself that I need to get through it quickly so that I can get to the delicious journals of all the various writers that he quoted so extensively in the book because they&apos;re the real attraction for me.

And current trends indicate the energy sector is next. As Jeremy Rifkin puts it in his book the Third Industrial revolution, we can expect a &quot;democratisation of energy&quot;. As with other industries over the past few decades, young technology companies \u2013 startups \u2013 are an important driver for democratisation as they are often better than large companies at developing and introducing technological and business innovations. To help them succeed, so-called accelerators are now turning their attention to the energy industry. Already a phenomenon in the internet industry, acceleration programmes support startups to build scalable and innovative businesses, faster than they would be able to on their own. Accelerating startups Startups operate in small teams, initially with two or three co-founders occupying a garage or a living room with a couple of computers and plentiful talent and passion to change the world. With such characteristics and a casual working culture, they are process-free environments, flexible and highly adaptable to change. This makes them innovative. However, startups have high rates of failure. Eight out of 10 fail, according to a recent study by Bloomberg. This is where accelerators come in. To help entrepreneurs turn great ideas into scalable businesses. Pioneered by US-based Y-Combinator and Techstars, accelerators aim to turn the craft of creating a business into a template. In exchange for a small equity stake, they provide the initial capital and support to help get the business off the ground. Accelerators are like universities for entrepreneurs. As with universities, startups are admitted into an accelerator after a rigorous selection process. The primary value of accelerator programmes comes from mentoring. Through these programmes entrepreneurs get access to mentors and investors that have been successful entrepreneurs themselves, are CEOs of incumbent companies, or industry investors and specialists. Especially in the energy industry, these mentors can open doors, help validate solutions in the marketplace, find launching customers or partners, essentially accelerating the first phase of a starting company. Democratisation of energy  There&apos;s been an exponential growth in startups targeting the energy sector. Mosaic enables investment in solar panels through crowdfunding, Opower offers services that help balance the power grid by providing demand and response incentives to end users. You can share a ride with car-sharing company Ridejoy and enjoy affordable and sustainable transportation.  Energy technology startup Bidgely gives customers access to detailed information on the energy consumption of appliances and provides suggestions on how to save energy. Nest is developing a thermostat that programmes itself, lowering energy bills by automatically adapting to people&apos;s behaviour. These are just a few examples of how internet technology has an impact on the way we use, produce and even trade energy. And we&apos;ve only just started, there&apos;s more to come. The incumbents &quot;There is actually limited bandwidth within the energy utility companies to handle all the potential innovations that are taking place,&quot; says Jonathan Robinson of energy consultants Frost &amp; Sullivan. &quot;Factors such as the growth in renewable energy and distributed generation are proving quite disruptive to the status quo in the energy market. Utilities are having to take on this challenge, while also investing in a range of grid upgrade projects.&quot; For startups in this sector, knowing the investment priorities and actions of the energy utility companies is vital to determining where their products and solutions will be required. &quot;Very often, the ICT sector is ready to go with a particular technology, believing strong demand exists, but is then puzzled by the slow rate of adoption in the energy sector. Having an understanding of the energy sector&apos;s smart grid priorities is extremely helpful to determine which ICT tools are most relevant at the time.&quot; So it won&apos;t be easy for startups to have a breakthrough in the energy industry, at least not compared to industries that have already been conquered. The accelerator model in the energy industry Recognising the role IT startups can play in the energy transition, accelerator programmes have started to emerge around the world to help energy startups get off the ground. Some well-known examples are Surge in Houston, Texas, and Azimpo in Israel. The first smart energy accelerator in Europe was recently launched by Rockstart Accelerator, an Amsterdam-based programme that has been accelerating startups in the web and mobile industry for the past two years. Ruth van Wieren founded Nothing But Impact in 2008 and Blue Hero in 2011. She is now part of the Rockstart Smart Energy team.

Sandy caused 159 deaths and an estimated $65bn in damage, left millions of homes without power and multiplied commute times across the region. Parts of America&apos;s east coast are still recovering. Superstorm Sandy was supposed to be a once-in-a-generation event, but many scientists believe that such storms will become both more frequent and more destructive. Rapid urbanisation around the world means that they will also disproportionately affect city-dwellers, especially in coastal regions, where nearly half of the world&apos;s population lives. Last year, the US government spent about $100bn on disaster cleanup related to extreme weather events \u2013 more than it spent on transportation or education. Building resilience to natural disasters is both a humanitarian mandate and an economic imperative. We usually think of disaster preparedness and response as the responsibility of government, and from New York and New Orleans to Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, cities are leading the way with ambitious programs to protect residents from harm. Non-profits are helping the cause by stimulating policy innovation and community engagement \u2013 witness the Rockefeller Foundation&apos;s 100 Resilient Cities Centennial Challenge and Mercy Corps&apos; global disaster preparedness initiatives. But given the scale of the challenge, the inescapable fact is that we in the private sector have a critical role to play in building more resilient cities. Specifically, private companies should contribute by developing technologies and business models that support early warning, hardened infrastructure, and risk pooling \u2013 key elements of the &quot;resilient operating systems&quot; that cities will increasingly need. First, the private sector can apply the innovation that brought us the &quot;Internet of Everything&quot; to upgrade early warning capabilities. The faster we identify where storms are likeliest to hit, the better we can target our efforts to prevent and respond to damage. Technologies that link sensor networks, large-scale data analysis and communications systems provide decision-makers with timely information to guide response. For example, Siemens implemented a levee monitoring system in the Netherlands that uses sensors to monitor water pressure, temperature and shifting weather patterns to identify areas that are at risk of being breached and trigger alarms. IBM&apos;s Smarter Cities programme provides a digital command centre that integrates real-time information on storm conditions, emergency response assets, and areas at risk. Better sensors, more powerful analytics, and new communication technologies will increase foresight and even save lives. Second, companies can help to &quot;harden&quot; infrastructure, improving the speed of recovery after disasters strike. Redundant systems for critical infrastructure and waterproof or diesel-powered pumping systems can reduce the chance of water and power system failures. System intelligence is another form of hardening; embedding sensors and controls into power lines and water treatment plants can allow cities to assess hazardous conditions, take preventative actions and target repair efforts. Finally, businesses can also develop new financial models to help cities more efficiently manage risk. Most disasters are low-frequency, high-impact events, and few cities have the resources to finance response and reconstruction on their own.  New funding solutions can help. In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority recently insured itself against infrastructure damage from storm surges by investing in cost-effective catastrophe bonds. Asset sharing is another important strategy. These days, most city managers understand it doesn&apos;t make sense to own a stockpile of flood-relief equipment \u2013 it&apos;s too expensive to pay for, store and maintain. Today, they can access flood relief pumping &quot;as a service,&quot; just as they can access cloud computing or car sharing services. Before Sandy hit, for example, Xylem brought technicians and hundreds of rental pumps from across America to the mid-Atlantic; since then, they have been deployed to combat floods in other cities. This service model creates flexibility and &quot;surge capacity&quot;; it&apos;s effective and economical for cities and a good business opportunity for us. Beyond innovation in technology and business models, the private sector can contribute most by taking a seat at the table and asking how they can help. Governments and civic organizations are putting ambitious policy frameworks in place, political will and popular sentiment support taking action, and a great deal of the technology needed already exists. We already have many of the ingredients needed to build &quot;resilient operating systems&quot; in cities around the world; now, as Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) official David Miller recently noted, it is a question of affordability and coordination. Investments by companies like Xylem, Siemens, IBM and countless others will help to ensure that our cities will be better prepared for the next Sandy, whenever and wherever it strikes.

Revelling in the heaps of recently translated records from the 17th-century Dutch colony of New Netherland, Shorto recreated a time when Manhattan was full of wolves and bears wandering through fields of strawberries, when settlers (initially a job lot of seasick Walloons) clung only to its southern tip (New Amsterdam), and when the currency of trade was guilders, beaver pelts and wampum. It is a true obsessive&apos;s book, throwing in everything from the story of the farcical little colony of New Sweden to the origin of duffel cloth. It is also a superb exercise in prelapsarian pastoral, conjuring up the half century or so during which Europeans heading up the Hudson river would find prosperous and settled Mohawk towns and traded with them on equal terms, sharing meals of beans, pumpkin and corn. By the time the English finally took the region from the Dutch in 1674, this idyll was already severely damaged and on Manhattan itself by 1680 &quot;the Manhattan Indians are referred to in the past tense&quot;. One of Shorto&apos;s principal reasons for writing The Island at the Centre of the World was a sense that the unique Dutch contribution to the DNA of the US had been played down, relegated to a mere handful of picturesque scraps \u2013 the Bronx being named after Farmer Bronck, the words coleslaw and stoop and so on. Looking at the Atlantic seaboard in the 17th century there are three principal experiments in European settlement. In the English colonies to the south what emerges is a faux-bluff squirearchy based ever more crushingly on black slavery. In the English colonies to the north, ship after ship of distasteful nutters struggled to create a monochrome theocracy. The third experiment is the Dutch one on the coast in between, which results in a chaotic, tolerant, ethnically all-over-the-place amalgam \u2013 the real winning mixture, both for the future of New York City and as a key strand within the US itself. Shorto&apos;s new book about Amsterdam is in a sense a sequel to and justification for The Island at the Centre of the World. In the earlier book he sketched briefly but effectively the history and atmosphere of New Amsterdam&apos;s mother city and why it mattered so much; here he looks at the deeper roots of Amsterdam&apos;s liberal exceptionalism and its significance for the wider world, from the city&apos;s origins as a squashy medieval mudflat to its current glowing reputation among the ignorant as a sort of sex/bong Shangri-La. It is inevitably a less original book and suffers from the usual problems of history focused on a single city, but Shorto is an excellent storyteller and rootler of strange facts, and Amsterdam should be issued as standard kit for anyone visiting the city who is not entirely corroded by vice. Amsterdam&apos;s luck lay in its dreadful location. By the time it was founded in around 1100 all the more desirable sites in Europe had long been parcelled up and covered in a dense web of lay or religious aristocratic ownership. For obvious reasons a shambles of shifting mudflats in which handfuls of fishermen and reed-cutters slithered around were not viewed as a high prize. Locals banded together to improve their lot, developing ever more elaborate systems to control the water that so often engulfed their rather unpleasant homes. In 1200, a dam was built across the Amstel river, giving the settlement its final name and marking the centre of what became through luck, ruthlessness and ingenuity a great city. It was this mix of seigneurial indifference to the area and enforced co-operation (which extended to other neighbouring areas such as Zeeland) that gave the region from its very beginning a unique social as well as geographical flatness. Shorto ably and entertainingly takes the reader through the grandeurs and miseries of Amsterdam&apos;s rise to power. The least effective parts of the book are those featuring famous people who have lived in the city (here comes Rembrandt; oh here are John and Yoko at the Hilton). In an audacious but welcome move he hardly bothers with most of the 18th and 19th centuries as so little of wider interest happens in the city. What he does focus on is the extraordinary efflorescence of Amsterdam in the 16th and 17th centuries, and its terrible fate in the 1940s, and then weaves these togetherto understand the inhabitants&apos; persistent liberalism, which remains so marked in the 21st century. Amsterdam&apos;s liberalism is important in itself, but also because it was exported, not just to North America but also, through the Glorious Revolution, to Britain and its empire, and to the rest of Europe through the writings of Spinoza. An obvious problem with city history is that cities themselves are so rarely independent actors and often what is most interesting about them happens elsewhere. Shorto deals with this problem through the merry expedient of just ignoring it. This creates all kinds of oddities. There is no discussion, for example, of the powerful influence of its German neighbours on Amsterdam. Is the city&apos;s liberalism merely a local node for ideas just as ingrained in places such as Hamburg or L\u00fcbeck? Even stranger is that Shorto is effectively unable to come up with a way of integrating (or even starting to explain) the complex relationship with The Hague or the resentments and aspirations of other Dutch towns. Above all, he seems to see something natural, special and organic about Amsterdam&apos;s freedom. But the city could equally be seen as just a fortunate, remote northern survivor from what had once been a dense network of Low Country &quot;liberal&quot; trading cities, most of which were successfully crushed and normalised by French or Spanish troops. The ghastly fate of its southern twin Antwerp, once the biggest importer in the world \u2013 its people slaughtered, the survivors violently recatholicised or expelled and its access to the sea blocked for two centuries \u2013 could easily have been shared by Amsterdam. On occasion, Shorto is good at wrecking his own argument for Amsterdam&apos;s baseline liberalism, by coming up with spectacular examples of city officials being no less terrible than the Spanish. In the first throes of Protestantism, the city was the site of appalling scenes, as Anabaptists had their chests cut open and hearts pulled out to be smeared, still beating, on their faces. And once the Reformation had settled in, as the people of Scotland, New England and elsewhere can testify, there is nothing inherently whatever-bag-you&apos;re-into and free-wheeling about Calvinism. Amsterdam&apos;s espousal of reform was accompanied, before and after, with ferocious violence. In his grim, well-handled, sections on the Holocaust in Amsterdam, Shorto shows how, under acute pressure, illiberal, mercenary or vicious strains in the population could be nurtured just as much as in the rest of Occupied Europe. Amsterdam is worth buying for chapter four alone: a superb, gruesome account of the early years of the East India Company (another, on reflection, not brilliantly liberal outfit). Shorto ends by discussing multiculturalism and the new threats it presents to the city&apos;s long-cultivated civilised indifference. As his book makes clear, almost despite itself, Amsterdam&apos;s form of liberalism cannot be taken for granted, and is more fragile and less ingrained than one would like to think. The argument within the city about its own identity has been going on for almost a millennium; it can never be assumed that the right people will win. \u2022 Simon Winder&apos;s most recent book is Danubia: A Personal History of Habsburg Europe.", "sentences": ["Revelling in the heaps of recently translated records from the 17th-century Dutch colony of New Netherland, Shorto recreated a time when Manhattan was full of wolves and bears wandering through fields of strawberries, when settlers (initially a job lot of seasick Walloons) clung only to its southern tip (New Amsterdam), and when the currency of trade was guilders, beaver pelts and wampum.", "Shorto&apos;s new book about Amsterdam is in a sense a sequel to and justification for The Island at the Centre of the World.", "In the earlier book he sketched briefly but effectively the history and atmosphere of New Amsterdam&apos;s mother city and why it mattered so much; here he looks at the deeper roots of Amsterdam&apos;s liberal exceptionalism and its significance for the wider world, from the city&apos;s origins as a squashy medieval mudflat to its current glowing reputation among the ignorant as a sort of sex/bong Shangri-La.", "It is inevitably a less original book and suffers from the usual problems of history focused on a single city, but Shorto is an excellent storyteller and rootler of strange facts, and Amsterdam should be issued as standard kit for anyone visiting the city who is not entirely corroded by vice.", "Amsterdam&apos;s luck lay in its dreadful location.", "Shorto ably and entertainingly takes the reader through the grandeurs and miseries of Amsterdam&apos;s rise to power.", "What he does focus on is the extraordinary efflorescence of Amsterdam in the 16th and 17th centuries, and its terrible fate in the 1940s, and then weaves these togetherto understand the inhabitants&apos; persistent liberalism, which remains so marked in the 21st century.", "Amsterdam&apos;s liberalism is important in itself, but also because it was exported, not just to North America but also, through the Glorious Revolution, to Britain and its empire, and to the rest of Europe through the writings of Spinoza.", "There is no discussion, for example, of the powerful influence of its German neighbours on Amsterdam.", "Above all, he seems to see something natural, special and organic about Amsterdam&apos;s freedom.", "The ghastly fate of its southern twin Antwerp, once the biggest importer in the world \u2013 its people slaughtered, the survivors violently recatholicised or expelled and its access to the sea blocked for two centuries \u2013 could easily have been shared by Amsterdam.", "On occasion, Shorto is good at wrecking his own argument for Amsterdam&apos;s baseline liberalism, by coming up with spectacular examples of city officials being no less terrible than the Spanish.", "Amsterdam&apos;s espousal of reform was accompanied, before and after, with ferocious violence.", "In his grim, well-handled, sections on the Holocaust in Amsterdam, Shorto shows how, under acute pressure, illiberal, mercenary or vicious strains in the population could be nurtured just as much as in the rest of Occupied Europe.", "Amsterdam is worth buying for chapter four alone: a superb, gruesome account of the early years of the East India Company (another, on reflection, not brilliantly liberal outfit).", "As his book makes clear, almost despite itself, Amsterdam&apos;s form of liberalism cannot be taken for granted, and is more fragile and less ingrained than one would like to think."], "title": "Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City by Russell Shorto \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/23/amsterdam-liberal-city-russell-shorto", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Amsterdam holidays", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-23T13:00:00Z", "article": "Football, Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 says in the course of what might well be the most compelling autobiography ever to appear under a footballer&apos;s name, was just a way to get noticed. A better way than stealing bicycles in the harsh suburb of Malm\u00f6 where he grew up as the child of immigrant parents, and a way that would make him rich as he scored goals for one after another of the great clubs of Europe: Ajax of Amsterdam, Juventus of Turin, the two Milan giants, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. He has won titles with each of them, but never for Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal or any of the other Premier League colossi who could certainly have afforded his stratospheric wages. The English public took against Ibrahimovi\u0107 early on, withholding their respect until the night last November on which he scored all the goals in Sweden&apos;s 4-2 victory over England, finishing the match with an astonishing 25-yard bicycle kick. At that point, even his most resolute detractors, those who had dismissed him as nothing more than a rather unpleasant show-off who failed to produce the goods on big occasions, were forced to admit his qualities. The sometimes audacious honesty of\u00a0his book, written with the Swedish author David Lagercrantz, provides a further corrective for those of us who underestimated him. Like Ibrahimovi\u0107, Dennis Bergkamp came to prominence as a teenager with Ajax, played in Italy with Internazionale and became noted for scoring goals that displayed a wonderful imagination and a virtuoso&apos;s technique. There the resemblance ends, which is why their books are worth reading in tandem. Where Ibrahimovi\u0107 fought his way out of a challenging background, in which he was passed between his divorced parents \u2013 his father was a Bosnian Muslim, his mother a Croatian Catholic \u2013 and responded with indifference to formal education, Bergkamp was the cherished child of a stable, church-going Amsterdam family, comfortable at school and in the celebrated Ajax academy for young players, where he was encouraged to think as well as to kick. Bergkamp is a quiet, analytical man who arrived at Arsenal in 1995, having failed to settle with his Italian club, and played a major part in the revolution wrought by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.     Dennis Bergkamp, Stillness and Speed: My Story    The two footballers&apos; motivation could not be more contrasting. Describing the volatile Italian defender Marco Materazzi, Ibrahimovi\u0107 notes: &quot;He&apos;s like me. Hatred and revenge are what gets him going.&quot; By contrast Bergkamp was summed up by one of his early coaches, the veteran Leo Beenhakker, as &quot;the ideal son-in-law&quot;, a description so apt that it stuck. Ibrahimovi\u0107&apos;s fourth goal against England was typical of his style as a player and a man. He scores with impudence, occasionally with seeming disdain. Some of his most spectacular goals have come with back-heels, a technique that exasperates managers and coaches. But to Ibrahimovi\u0107, managers and coaches are less important than his agent. In the very first chapter of his book, recounting a less than fulfilling (although still prolific) year with Barcelona, he accuses the club&apos;s head coach, Pep Guardiola, widely regarded as the most gifted tactician of his era, of cowardice. Ibrahimovi\u0107 prefers coaches who, in his view, are not afraid of &quot;strong characters&quot; like himself. &quot;A proper manager can deal with different personalities,&quot; he remarks after describing Guardiola taking him aside and trying to get him to conform to Barcelona&apos;s code of humility. &quot;Here at Bar\u00e7a,&quot; Guardiola tells him, &quot;we keep our feet on the ground. So we don&apos;t turn up to training sessions in Ferraris and Porsches.&quot; For a while, Ibrahimovi\u0107 dutifully trundles around in the sponsor&apos;s Audi, but finally cracks and, on the day of a match for which he has been relegated to the bench, signals his terminal disaffection by parking his $400,000 (\u00a3247,000) limited-edition Ferrari Enzo right outside the club front door. He appreciates coaches who, like Fabio Capello, are happy to see their players scrapping on the training pitch.\u00a0Ibrahimovi\u0107 gets into a few of\u00a0those fights with teammates during the course of the book, with other &quot;strong characters&quot;, such as Patrick Vieira and Sinisa Mihajlovic. The alpha-male ethic ensures that these incidents end up with the teammates in a state of mutual admiration, even affection. Bergkamp is no softie; those against whom he has played could certainly testify to his readiness when provoked to show a bit of spite, adroitly disguised, on the pitch. But there are times in his autobiography when he gives the impression of having played the game in order to escape attention, to disappear into the realm of angles and velocities in which he could exercise not just his supremely delicate touch with a football but also his remarkable spatial awareness. A player of great technical originality, Bergkamp is also something of a philosopher. He endeared himself to British spectators through goals such as the hallucinatory one he scored against Newcastle in March 2002: with his back to goal, he flicked the ball around one side of his marker, turned and ran round the other side, and met the ball \u2013 to which he had imparted a spin that enabled it to bounce into his path \u2013 in time to guide it past the goalkeeper. Today, he says, he is still asked if he meant to do that. &quot;The whole question is strange,&quot; he says. &quot;What do they mean by what did I mean? Which part do they think I didn&apos;t mean? Do I think it all in advance? Do I think, &apos;I&apos;ll put it there, turn this way, then push?&apos; Of course not. The situation creates the move. The question is always &apos;How do you adjust?&apos; If people ask, &apos;Did you mean the goal?&apos; I say: &apos;No, when I got on the coach to Newcastle I didn&apos;t mean to score a goal\u00a0like that.&apos;&quot; In Ibrahimovi\u0107&apos;s view, too, &quot;football isn&apos;t something you plan in advance. Football just happens.&quot; But for Bergkamp there&apos;s more to it, even when instinct and intuition are involved, and several pages are devoted to a discussion of that goal alone in a book that is intended for students of football and of his career. Even their approach to the task of autobiography offers a significant contrast. Ibrahimovi\u0107 chose a ghost-writer who would function in the traditional way, as a ventriloquist (and has done so with great accuracy, according to Swedes familiar with the player). Bergkamp allows his story to be told in the words of David Winner, the author of a much-admired analysis of Dutch football. Winner interviews Bergkamp \u2013 who retired in 2006 and is now a senior coach with Ajax \u2013 at length, but intersperses his narrative with his own observations and with material from conversations with friends and colleagues such as Wenger, Vieira and Thierry Henry. He also talks to those responsible for the more difficult passages of the player&apos;s career, such as the Italian coach Osvaldo Bagnoli, who shows no sign even now of recognising the flaws in his own approach to such a gifted individual. These men are both top footballers \u2013 even top, top, top footballers, as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho would say. But if there is a single conclusion to be drawn from the two books, it is that the revenge-seeking showoff and the ideal son-in-law both required understanding.", "sentences": ["A better way than stealing bicycles in the harsh suburb of Malm\u00f6 where he grew up as the child of immigrant parents, and a way that would make him rich as he scored goals for one after another of the great clubs of Europe: Ajax of Amsterdam, Juventus of Turin, the two Milan giants, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain.", "Where Ibrahimovi\u0107 fought his way out of a challenging background, in which he was passed between his divorced parents \u2013 his father was a Bosnian Muslim, his mother a Croatian Catholic \u2013 and responded with indifference to formal education, Bergkamp was the cherished child of a stable, church-going Amsterdam family, comfortable at school and in the celebrated Ajax academy for young players, where he was encouraged to think as well as to kick."], "title": "I am Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 by Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/23/zlatan-ibrahimovic-autobiography-review", "tags": ["Autobiography and memoir", "Biography", "Sport and leisure", "Books", "Culture", "Zlatan Ibrahimovic"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-23T15:05:00Z", "article": "&quot;It&apos;s for people who don&apos;t want to queue for easyJet at 4am,&quot; says Flic Everett, co-founder of RoadRailandSea.co.uk, a site dedicated to overland travel across Europe from the UK. &quot;It&apos;s for people who want to enjoy the journey.&quot; Everett set up the site with her photographer husband Simon Buckley, after struggling to find the information they needed for a driving trip through France and Italy.

In late July, Hayley was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. On her return from Blackpool, she told Roy of her decision to end her own life when the time felt right. All of it slotted into the tradition of bold pathos locked into tender northern storytelling. For Coronation Street fans, the denouement of Hayley Cropper is stinging long and hard. History will likely judge it among the saddest of Weatherfield exits. In her own small way, Cropper has changed the way we watch soap opera. She has shifted a corner of the national debate into warmer, more inclusive terrain. Roy and Hayley are one of the few outposts in soap you can turn to for moral virtue. Among the serial killers, pin-ups, playboys, alcoholics and adulterers of contemporary Corrie, the couple in the zip-up cardigan and the red anorak have become an unlikely symbol of purity. Roy and Hayley defy television&apos;s glamour axis. Hayley was introduced as the punchline to a clumsy gag, reflective of less enlightened Corrie times. In 1997, it was not right but it was OK to make primetime jokes at the expense of the British margins. The producers had decided that perennial middle-aged virgin and fusspot Roy was ready to seek companionship. Hayley was to be the first in a string of disastrous blind dates he had organised after posting a lonely hearts ad. The intended joke was that Hayley was a pre-op transsexual born Harold Patterson. Trust Roy! It quickly, magically backfired, as the discreet chemistry between actors David Neilson and Julie Hesmondhalgh lit up\u00a0a quaint corner of the screen. Roy and Hayley&apos;s modern storyline has been played straight and old-fashioned, carrying with it a\u00a0notoriously rigid audience resistant to moving with the political moment, let alone surpassing it. Hayley was whipped off to Amsterdam to complete her gender reassignment surgery and an initially affronted Roy strode into town to declare his love. They married in an impromptu ceremony, not legally recognised, in his newly acquired greasy spoon, Roy&apos;s Rolls, aided and abetted by the character at the centre of the last heartbreaking Coronation Street cancer demise, Alma Sedgewick. This was a time just prior to the parochial, then national recognition, of the gay village circumnavigating Canal Street as one of Manchester&apos;s social heartlands. It predated Channel\u00a04&apos;s pivotal gay drama Queer as Folk by two years and transgendered Portuguese starlet Nadia Almada winning Big Brother by seven. It was eight years before civil partnerships became recognised in statute and Elton and David validated the legalese for suburbia. It is astonishing, in retrospect, to be reminded that Coronation Street&apos;s first LGBT character and foreground storyline was T.     'The tide comes in quickly' \u2026 Hayley and Roy in Corrie    The beauty of Hayley \u2013 and it&apos;s a testament to the brilliant actress who plays her \u2013 is that she has never been just a T. She is foremost, always, an H. Humanised at every corner by her soft delivery, generous ear, calm, maternal instinct and wonky half-smile, Hesmondhalgh has gifted Hayley a full three dimensions. She and Roy have spun a spider&apos;s web of friends throughout the Street and, in malevolent Tracy Barlow, one enemy. Roy and Hayley&apos;s love affair has been Corrie&apos;s take on a Burton and Taylor moment, as if enacted over a lager and lime in Napoleon&apos;s, the boozer on the corner of Bloom and Sackville Streets that has warmed and watered the city&apos;s real-time Hayleys since the 1960s. Figuratively, the effect of Hayley Cropper, Coronation Street&apos;s first transgender character, is trickier to quantify. When she first appeared in Weatherfield, Hayley became instant target practice for the prejudices of the Sun&apos;s then TV columnist Garry Bushell.

In a soap world of self-interest and ambition, bed-hopping and backstabbing, she represents goodness. Hesmondhalgh leaves an open goal for producers, too.

Brown&apos;s automatic one-match ban, issued for kicking Neymar, was increased to three by Uefa. Celtic are contesting that, with a date for the hearing yet to be confirmed. Lennon has studied the written reasons behind his captain&apos;s suspension and is confident of having it overturned. Brown&apos;s return for the crucial meetings with Ajax and Milan would hand Celtic a further boost after they defeated the Dutch champions 2-1 in Glasgow on Tuesday night. &quot;It is quite vague,&quot; said Lennon of Uefa&apos;s detail. &quot;I am not convinced about the wording of it. I think we have got a good case to appeal it.&quot; Should Brown&apos;s absence be confirmed, Lennon at least has solace in the form of Beram Kayal. The Israeli midfielder was an instant revelation after joining Celtic in 2010 and has been linked with a series of English clubs. Injuries and loss of form subsequently saw Kayal marginalised but he returned to prominence with the second of Celtic&apos;s goals against Ajax. &quot;I don&apos;t think you ever lose it,&quot; said Lennon. &quot;Physically you can lose it because injuries take their toll. And maybe that has been a little bit of the case for Beram. But in pre-season he started looking like himself, then he had a hip injury and a groin injury which kept him out for a month. The start of his season has been a little bit disjointed. I felt on Saturday at Hibs he was starting to look a lot better and that goal [against Ajax] will have given him a massive shot in the arm. &quot;I think he always believed he could do it, that he just needed game time. But last season with Victor Wanyama playing so well, and Joe Ledley and Charlie Mulgrew, competition was pretty fierce in there. Now it&apos;s his time and he has maximised the opportunity.&quot; Lennon added: &quot;If Brown&apos;s suspension holds up then I am going to need him. Beram looks after himself, he works really hard. He is a good professional. He has been desperate to re-ignite his form and I think he has done that. That will give him, everyone, a big lift.&quot; Tuesday&apos;s result hauled Celtic back from a position where they could have been consigned to also-rans status in Group H. They now retaining hope of qualifying for the last-16. Celtic face Ajax and Barcelona away from home and Milan in Glasgow to round off their section. &quot;I just wanted to win the game for my own reputation, the club&apos;s reputation, the players&apos; reputation,&quot; added Lennon. &quot;It has given us an opportunity now to go forward in the group. I think we can give any team a game at home. Now it is really important, if we want to make the top two places, that we pick up something away. &quot;In the Nou Camp that is going to be really difficult, but we are really going to look at Amsterdam and think: &apos;Can we get something there?&apos; I saw enough in the game to suggest we can, but I also saw enough in the game to suggest it is going to be really difficult because they are a very good side.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;In the Nou Camp that is going to be really difficult, but we are really going to look at Amsterdam and think: &apos;Can we get something there?&apos; I saw enough in the game to suggest we can, but I also saw enough in the game to suggest it is going to be really difficult because they are a very good side.&quot;"], "title": "Neil Lennon believes Celtic can overturn Scott Brown's enhanced ban", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/23/celtic-scott-brown-suspension-barcelona", "tags": ["Celtic", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-24T07:00:00Z", "article": "When it was suggested that we house homeless people in steel shipping containers in a scrap metal yard, I thought it was either April Fool&apos;s Day or we had lost all concept of decency. But then I was shown photographs of the amazing work being undertaken by TempoHousing in the Netherlands, and realised what was possible. Brighton Housing Trust, working with QED, is developing 36 studio flats within two blocks, using adapted shipping containers at a town centre site. The units were designed and constructed in Holland specifically for a social housing project in Amsterdam that failed to materialise due to funding difficulties. The units were available at a discounted rate which adds to the financial viability of this proposal. The first of the containers arrived before dawn on Monday, the 36th comes on Friday. Over the next four weeks a green roof, stairwells and external walkways will be constructed, and final touches made to the internal decor before the first residents move in on 25 November. Before embarking on this venture, we spoke with our homeless clients about the concept. They loved it. In particular, they loved the fact residents would have their own kitchen, bathroom and front door. They felt that being self-contained is far more desirable than a room in a shared house even though the floor space, at 26 sq m, is roughly the same as they would have if they were sharing.     Shipping containers for homeless people Photograph: Brighton Housing Trust    Shipping containers have rarely been used as temporary living accommodation in the United Kingdom but there are a number of examples in continental Europe. The most notable project is in Keetwonen in Amsterdam, a development by TempoHousing of 1,000 containers using exactly the same internal design layout as the ones we are proposing to use. It was completed in 2006 and is still in use today. I was sceptical at the outset, but quickly won over. The toilet and shower unit is exactly the same as my daughter had in her student accommodation and she much preferred it to having to share bathrooms and toilets with other students. Who wouldn&apos;t? What really excites me about this opportunity is that land that might otherwise lie idle for five years will be brought back into life and used to provide much-needed temporary accommodation for 36 men and women in Brighton and Hove. At the point when the site is to be redeveloped, the accommodation units can be transferred to other locations, be they in Brighton and Hove or elsewhere. This appears to me to be very attractive from a sustainability perspective. What could be more sustainable than reusing an existing shipping container, converted in a bespoke factory in Europe, into a modular transportable and reusable temporary housing unit? Yes, some people might not like the idea, but I would bet the 36 men and women who will live in this accommodation will not be among them.

Though most of the film takes place in the desert immediately adjacent to the Mexican border, there are brief scenes in Amsterdam and in London, some key moments in Ciudad Juarez, and even jaunts to Chicago and Boise, Idaho, of all places. Working as a screenwriter for the first time after years of seeing his novels successfully adapted to the screen, McCarthy is stretching his powers of language and mood \u2013 and, all too quickly, stretching his slim story and cast of characters way too far. Like a filmed play about the drug trade in which all of the action is offstage, The Counselor is what happens when a lawyer known only as The Counselor (Michael Fassbender) decides to invest in a particular drug shipment going from Juarez to Chicago, and then \u2013 through utter coincidence \u2013 the deal goes wrong, and his life spins entirely out of control. Though we first meet the Counselor in a raw and nicely intimate bedroom scene with his fiancee (Penelope Cruz), he&apos;s already a rough character, hanging out with the cartoonish thug played by Javier Bardem, and the drawling, 10-gallon-hat-wearing know-it-all played by Brad Pitt. At the tip top of that dirty heap is Cameron Diaz&apos;s Malkina, a woman who seems to employ but also sleeps with Bardem, and is slowly revealed to be pulling every possible string in every dirty deal that surrounds the story.     Cameron Diaz in The Counselor    Malkina is no average ice queen baddie. Adorned with elaborate spotted tattoos that match her two pet cheetahs, skintight dresses and silver nails so shiny they look like weapons, Malkina is more like a sci-fi monster, a bit of theatricality dropped into the scrubby Texas desert. Her intense presence matches the film&apos;s over boiled dialogue, handing Diaz lines like &quot;To see quarry killed with elegance is moving to me,&quot; or allowing a side character played by Bruno Ganz to meditate, &quot;We announce to the darkness that we will not be diminished by the brevity of our lives.&quot; With most of the action takes place offscreen the characters do a lot of talking, but it&apos;s mostly in metaphor and grand pronouncements that take nearly the entire scene to untangle. And with new characters constantly arriving and disappearing, and too much time given to tangential moments like Diaz&apos;s attention-grabbing sex scene atop a car windshield, it takes constant work to know where the story is going \u2013 work that this fairly rote and bloody saga doesn&apos;t ever earn. The language grabs so much attention that it&apos;s difficult for director Ridley Scott to make his presence felt, and he largely underserves the gorgeous scenery and brutal morality of McCarthy&apos;s script. Many conversation scenes are shot in extreme close-up, exposing things like Cruz&apos;s freckles and Diaz&apos;s elaborate eye makeup, but failing to reveal anything about them. As the film moves toward its brutal conclusion Scott pushes hard on the emotion, with sweeping score and more close-ups demanding we feel sympathy for characters who barely exist. With Fassbender a blank patsy in one corner, and Diaz and Bardem hot-blooded horror shows in another, none of the actors or characters of The Counselor ever seem to exist together, participating in McCarthy&apos;s ambitious, florid writing experiment that was probably better as the script they all read before signing on. \u2022 The Counselor is out in the US on 25 October and in the UK on 15 November More on The Counselor \u2022\u00a0Oscar predictions on its awards chances", "sentences": ["Though most of the film takes place in the desert immediately adjacent to the Mexican border, there are brief scenes in Amsterdam and in London, some key moments in Ciudad Juarez, and even jaunts to Chicago and Boise, Idaho, of all places."], "title": "The Counselor - first look review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/24/the-counselor-review-ridley-scott", "tags": ["Ridley Scott", "Culture", "Brad Pitt", "Michael Fassbender", "Pen\u00e9lope Cruz", "Cameron Diaz", "Javier Bardem", "Cormac McCarthy"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-28T18:08:07Z", "article": "Two of the best loved paintings in the world, a pair of the five surviving versions of Vincent Van Gogh&apos;s Sunflowers which are now scattered across the world, will be displayed together at the National Gallery in London next year. One of the paintings will be loaned by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in return for the National Gallery&apos;s loan of its version when the Van Gogh reopened after a major renovation earlier this year. The two paintings are now virtually priceless \u2013 the author Martin Bailey, who recently traced all the surviving versions for a book, estimates the open market value of any of the Sunflowers at \u00a3100m plus \u2013 and are among the most instantly recognisable in both collections. The National Gallery bought its Sunflowers (right) in 1924, directly from the artist&apos;s family, and since then has sold millions of versions of it in posters and postcards \u2013 26,000 last year alone. Van Gogh painted the brilliantly coloured flowers, roughly arranged in cheap local pots, in a frenzy of work in his rented house in Arles in 1888, to decorate a room for his guest, fellow artist Paul Gauguin. He wrote to his brother Theo: &quot;I am hard at it, painting with the enthusiasm of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won&apos;t surprise you when you know that what I&apos;m at is the painting of some sunflowers. If I carry out this idea there will be a dozen panels. So the whole thing will be a symphony in blue and yellow. &quot;I am working at it every morning from sunrise on, for the flowers fade so quickly. I am now on the fourth picture of sunflowers.&quot; The National Gallery&apos;s is that fourth painting, made when many of the flowers were losing their petals and their brilliant colour. The paintings were last seen in London together 65 years ago. They will be exhibited with new scientific research on how both were made, and the materials used. Nicholas Penny, director of the National Gallery, said the exhibition was intended for those for whom the Sunflowers are compelling works of art: &quot;It will deepen every visitor&apos;s appreciation of the artist.&quot; Axel Ruger, director of the Van Gogh Museum, said they were honoured to have had the London painting on display in Amsterdam. &quot;This unique combination offered our audience the opportunity to compare these two famous icons in great detail. I am therefore glad to be able to offer the visitors to the National Gallery this special opportunity as well.&quot; Van Gogh, a failure at many attempted careers including art dealing and teaching, was often lonely and isolated in his life and work. When he was working on the Sunflowers, he hoped that he and Gauguin would live and work happily together and form the core of a community of artists in the French town. Instead they fell out violently, Gauguin left, and Van Gogh famously cut off part of his own ear in rage or despair, the beginning of a cycle of breakdowns which would lead to his suicide 18 months later. \u2022 The Sunflowers is at the National Gallery, London, from 25 January \u2013 27 April 2014", "sentences": ["One of the paintings will be loaned by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in return for the National Gallery&apos;s loan of its version when the Van Gogh reopened after a major renovation earlier this year.", "Nicholas Penny, director of the National Gallery, said the exhibition was intended for those for whom the Sunflowers are compelling works of art: &quot;It will deepen every visitor&apos;s appreciation of the artist.&quot; Axel Ruger, director of the Van Gogh Museum, said they were honoured to have had the London painting on display in Amsterdam."], "title": "Van Gogh Sunflowers to be reunited in National Gallery exhibition", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/28/van-gogh-sunflowers-national-gallery-exhibition-london", "tags": ["Van Gogh", "Art", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Culture", "UK news", "National Gallery"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-28T19:16:59Z", "article": "The death toll across Europe from storms that began sweeping the continent on Sunday has reached at least 12, with Britain, Germany and the Netherlands among the hardest hit.

There&apos;s the tinkle of a band playing. Enter the cast: a white man dressed plantation-style, in a white linen suit and hat, two black men in garish clown garb, and nine black youths in the clothes of itinerant poverty. A sparkling, circus-style sign appears, reading &quot;The Scottsboro Boys&quot;. A broad Southern voice announces that a tragic miscarriage of justice is about to be presented as a rollicking minstrel entertainment. Excuse me? When a musical by John Kander and Fred Ebb on the Scottsboro case was first presented in New York in 2010, many in the city didn&apos;t like the idea at all. This horrific chapter of American history \u2013 nine black teenagers pulled off a train and falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama in 1931, then subjected to Southern justice at its most criminally graphic \u2013 was far too serious to be presented in so cavalier and racially volatile a format, let alone by a white creative team. Theatres were picketed. Many theatregoers stayed away in protest. But my Aunt Billie wasn&apos;t among them. Six years old when the boys were arrested in 1931, Billie has vivid memories of them and recalls the case dominating adult conversation. The &quot;boys&quot; \u2013 two as young as 13 \u2013 had hitched a ride on a boxcar, which was illegal, but it was also the Depression and folks did it all the time. No big deal, unless you were male and black and there were white girls in your car. &quot;Miss Ann always cries rape,&quot; the grownups said. &quot;All you have to do is look at Miss Ann [the black term for white women], and you wind up in jail if you&apos;re lucky, dead if you&apos;re not.&quot; The case of the boys \u2013 their myriad trials and convictions, the threats of lynching even after one girl recanted, the assembly of mobs, the involvement of the Communist party \u2013 dominated the headlines of the black press, the Amsterdam News, the Pittsburg Courier, the Chicago Defender, all of which my grandmother and high-school teacher, Mamie, subscribed to and Billie read. Mamie became a driving force among those supporting the boys in their hometown of Richmond, Virginia. With young Billie at her side, Mamie picketed, raised money and attended political meetings, trials and conferences. That first Easter Billie chose money for the boys over her new pair of patent-leather Mary-Janes. The boys became her boys and, despite passing years, they remained so. Little surprise then that she welcomed the show. At last the story of her boys was being brought back to light. Then aged 85, a veteran of the New York theatre scene for 65 years, she became one of its champions. My own experience of the Scottsboro Boys \u2013 and I daresay that of many of those protesters \u2013 could not have been more different. My father, a year younger than my mother, didn&apos;t accompany the women on the picket lines. I grew up knowing of Emmett Till, but not the boys. Even during the intense political atmosphere of my university years, their case was rarely referenced. Was it because of the Communist party&apos;s involvement in the case? Were we loath to give a white-dominated organisation credit for their financial support and legal representation? Had the boys been too working-class or ignorant \u2013 and the case too sexually messy \u2013 to enter the approved pantheon of civil-rights martyrdom? Whatever the reason, my interaction with the show, which I saw in its Broadway transfer, was first of all in regards to its form. White folks liked to claim that their blackface shows were affectionate creations, but we always knew better. The burnt cork, white clown lips and bug eyes, the white gloves, the watermelon-eating chicken thieves, the Aunt Jemimas, Uncle Toms, Uncle Bens, golliwogs, Amos and Andys, Beulahs, jive-talking cartoon crows and Black and White Minstrels \u2013 all were dehumanising, nothing less. The pain generated from this imagery cannot be overestimated.     The Scottsboro Boys (from left to right) were Clarence Norris, Olen Montgomery, Andy Wright, Willie Roberson, Ozie Powell, Eugene Williams, Charlie Weems, Roy Wright, and Haywood Patterson. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    Though all-black minstrel shows began to tour shortly after the American civil war, the basic formula remained unchanged. The paying audience was overwhelmingly white and they wanted their singing, dancing stereotypes. There was more freedom in stage performance than sharecropping, but straying from expectation risked financial and physical destruction where lynch law was the norm. Though a few entrepreneurial black people managed to penetrate the field, the vast majority of producers were white with financial and cultural investments in stereotype \u2013 so how to confront a musical using this device with any kind of open mind? Yes, Kander and Ebb had proven themselves politically progressive, psychologically perceptive and rapier-witted in such work as Cabaret and Chicago, but these were white shows. Could they be trusted with us? Or would their efforts smack of Fred Astaire&apos;s blackface homage to Bojangles in Swing Time \u2013 well-meaning but sick-making? I needn&apos;t have worried. The Scottsboro Boys turns minstrelsy on its head. With one exception the cast is black, moving fluently between the bewildered youths that were arrested, the &quot;boys&quot; of minstrel expectation and the men they became; donning, mocking then discarding minstrel masques in the blink of an eye. Traditionally, it was taboo for black performers to play white characters: in this show, that&apos;s exactly that they do \u2013 by turns &quot;benevolent&quot;, bungling, belligerent or frigid as dry ice, often emphasising the arrogance of white power. The score is memorable; the physicality of Susan Stroman&apos;s production takes your breath away, at once entertaining and disturbing, as a subject this challenging should. In life, the Scottsboro boys were only fully exonerated long after all of them had died, when Alabama&apos;s governor signed a formal pardon in April 2013. On stage, I wonder if there could be a more apt telling of the travesty they endured. \u2022 Candace Allen is the author of Soul Music: The Pulse of Race and Music (Gibson Square)", "sentences": ["&quot;All you have to do is look at Miss Ann [the black term for white women], and you wind up in jail if you&apos;re lucky, dead if you&apos;re not.&quot; The case of the boys \u2013 their myriad trials and convictions, the threats of lynching even after one girl recanted, the assembly of mobs, the involvement of the Communist party \u2013 dominated the headlines of the black press, the Amsterdam News, the Pittsburg Courier, the Chicago Defender, all of which my grandmother and high-school teacher, Mamie, subscribed to and Billie read."], "title": "The Scottsboro Boys: a minstrel show like no other", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/29/scottsboro-boys-minstrel-show-accused-rape-new-york", "tags": ["Musicals", "Theatre", "Stage", "Race issues", "Alabama", "World news", "US news", "Culture", "London", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-29T10:18:42Z", "article": "The world has a choice when dealing with climate change. One is to decide it&apos;s a problem like any other, which can be dealt with slowly and over time. The other is to recognise it as a crisis, perhaps the unique crisis in human history, which will take rapid, urgent action to overcome. Science is in the second, scared camp \u2013 that&apos;s the meaning of the IPCC report issued last month, which showed that our planet is already undergoing climatic shifts far greater than any experienced in human civilisation, with far worse to come. And those of us urging divestment from fossil fuel stocks are in the second camp too \u2013 we recognise that business as usual is quite simply impossible. In fact, the most important feature of the IPCC report is probably that it adopted the analysis put forward by Carbon Tracker analysts in the UK and divestment activists who started their campaign a year ago in the US. The scientists&apos; report quite explicitly said that most of the coal and oil and gas that the fossil fuel industry has identified and plans to mine or drill must remain in the ground to avoid climate catastrophe. That in turn is why the fossil fuel industry, when it isn&apos;t in outright denial about climate change, falls into the first camp: slow, measured change would be nice. Because then we could pump up all the carbon we&apos;ve told our shareholders and our banks about. Because then our stock prices will stay nice and high. Because then we won&apos;t have to confront reality \u2013 otherwise known as physics \u2013 for a while longer. The gulf between these two camps poses a huge question for those who might think of themselves on the sidelines. Those, say, who own shares in the fossil fuel industry. In the US, a number of colleges, churches, and universities have begun to divest those stocks, arguing that they can&apos;t both simultaneously decry the wreckage of the climate and try to profit from it for a few more years. The mayor of Seattle explained that his city was already spending millions building seawalls \u2013 what sense did it make to invest in the companies making that work necessary? The trustees of San Francisco State University recognised that it made no sense to have, on the one hand, a physics department understanding climate change and on the other hand, an endowment full of oil and gas stocks. The United Church of Christ, which traces its roots back to the Pilgrims, decided it couldn&apos;t pay the pastor by investing in companies that are running Genesis backwards. This same opportunity is becoming part of a worldwide debate. From Africa come some of the loudest voices demanding divestment: Desmond Tutu, who watched the effectiveness of the movement a generation ago when it was stock in apartheid-tainted companies that was at issue, has asked us to take up the same tool. &quot;If you could see the drought and famine in Africa, you would understand why,&quot; he says. And it&apos;s not just North America responding. The Uniting Church in Australia, Anglican dioceses in New Zealand, and now the UK&apos;s Operation Noah have launched Bright Now \u2013 a church divestment campaign whose first success came earlier this month with the Quakers in Britain announcing they will disinvest from companies engaged in extracting fossil fuels making them the first UK Christian denomination to do so. In addition, UK university students are increasingly engaged in divestment campaigns as evidenced by the work undertaken by People &amp; Planet. To date there are 19 active divestment campaigns across the UK including universities with the largest endowments: Cambridge, Oxford and Edinburgh. We&apos;ll be looking to grow the campaign this month with the Fossil Free Europe tour, a divestment road show with stops in Berlin, Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Birmingham and London. Everyone involved in this campaign understands that divestment won&apos;t in fact bankrupt Exxon or BP or Shell, but they also understand how important it is to politically bankrupt them. These are now rogue industries, committed to burning more carbon than any government on earth thinks would be safe to burn. Their irresponsibility belongs to their executives and boards of directors \u2013 but it also belongs to anyone who holds their shares.

One of Verity&apos;s favourite facts is that around 40 million visitors come to Yorkshire every year for heritage-related tourism, which is more than the typical number of visitors to Times Square, the most visited tourist attraction in the world. &quot;Yorkshire&apos;s will be the greatest Grand D\u00e9part in the history of the Tour de France,&quot; said Verity in Paris the other week, with absolute conviction. When I sat down to write this piece, I put a call out on Twitter for suggestions of the best and worst places to visit in Yorkshire. A man called @davelee1968 was one of the first to respond: &quot;Stick a pin in the map,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It&apos;s all good.&quot; A university pal from Hebden Bridge I hadn&apos;t heard a peep out of for a decade popped up to suggest Yorkshire ought to be No\u00a01. &quot;Has anyone heard of the other two places?&quot; he asked. For fairness, I should point out that someone else chipped in: &quot;The best place in Yorkshire is the start of any road to\u00a0Lancashire.&quot;     The Hepworth Gallery in Wakefield: 'giving London a run for its money'. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Before I continue, a disclaimer. I&apos;m from the furthest reaches of the Red Rose County. The seaside town of Morecambe, to be precise. That&apos;s in Lancashire, for those of you who aren&apos;t hot on geography. But at the risk of sounding like someone who excuses her racist remarks by saying some of her best friends are black, my dad is from Sheffield. I did my journalism training in the Steel City, which is, for my money, the friendliest place in the country. And my other half is from Goole, an inland port in east Yorkshire yet to make it on any must-visit list. I\u00a0really like Yorkshire and Yorkshire folk. I just don&apos;t think we need to encourage them. Alas, it&apos;s too late. The Lonely Planet Best in Travel 2014 has already been published, inflating Yorkshire&apos;s ego even further by claiming: &quot;If the good people of Yorkshire were proud of their heritage before, the London 2012 Olympics only served to cement what they have always thought: that their county is better than \u2013 and really the best of \u2013 all the English counties.&quot; But how did Yorkshire end up on the\u00a0Lonely Planet&apos;s list? Tom Hall, editor of the website, explains: &quot;The\u00a0No\u00a01 reason we are recommending Yorkshire next year is the Tour de France. The second one is the Hepworth Gallery in Wakefield, which is giving London a run for its money. Thirdly, the eating and drinking\u00a0scene.&quot; A Londoner, Hall rejects the suggestion he is in some way biased after studying at Leeds University. He says he and five other experts decided on the list after taking into account recommendations from the firm&apos;s guidebook writers and readers around the globe. &quot;We then ranked the suggestions according to topicality, value for money, and the &apos;X factor&apos;. It was vaguely scientific,&quot; he said. There is no doubt that Yorkshire is going through a purple patch. Last week a stuttering teenager from a Dewsbury comprehensive won the nation&apos;s hearts in Educating Yorkshire: his humour and resilience the best modern example of his county&apos;s charm. And at the London Olympics last year, Yorkshire would have come 12th in the overall medals table, ahead of of Jamaica, Spain, South Africa and the 2016 hosts, Brazil. All thanks to the county&apos;s indefatigable sports stars \u2013 including Jessica Ennis-Hill (Sheffield), the Brownlee brothers (Horsforth near Leeds), cyclists Ed Clancy (Huddersfield) and Lizzie Armitstead (Otley), Yorkshire Dales rower Andy Triggs-Hodge and North Yorkshire rower Kat\u00a0Copeland. The Brownlees never miss a chance to say that growing up and training in Yorkshire has made them world-class athletes. Last year their dad claimed his sons&apos; secret was a diet of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. But Alistair and Jonny tend to credit their home county with making them tough. Just last month Alistair, who has white rose wallpaper as his Twitter background, was taking the mick out of his younger brother for spending too long in London and looking like a &quot;numpty&quot; (he was wearing a tight vest).     York Minster, York: awe-inspiring. Photograph: UK City Images/Alamy    Even Hollywood is charmed. On Monday it was revealed that Diane Keaton is planning a US TV remake of Last Tango in Halifax, a romantic drama about two widowed and retired septuagenarians who were childhood sweethearts rekindling their romance via Facebook. Yorkshire folk like to point out that London, despite hogging most of the tourists who visit Britain each year, is just one city, with no hills, no seaside, no forests. They&apos;ll tell you Beverley Minster was copied by Westminster and that York Minster knocks phoney St Paul&apos;s into a cocked hat. Doing little to dispel the reputation of Tykes as a chippy breed, a commenter on the Guardian&apos;s Northerner blog notes that Yorkshire boasts five big cities: Leeds, Sheffield, Hull, Bradford and York (as well as the smaller cathedral cities of Wakefield and Ripon). That it has the Dales, North York Moors, the Pennines and the Wolds. Not to mention the coast \u2013 Whitby, Robin Hood&apos;s Bay, Scarborough. Bempton, the Humber Bridge. London, in comparison, has the M25. Even Emley Moor Tower, a telecommunications and broadcasting facility in West Yorkshire, is 330m high, 21m taller than the Shard in London, boasted the contributor. We asked the people at Welcome to Yorkshire for a list of their top 10 places to visit, and they replied saying they couldn&apos;t produce a definitive list because there are &quot;too many&quot;. But Verity, the chief executive, is clearly delighted at being noticed by the Lonely Planet, saying: &quot;Endorsements rarely come much better than this, from a guide that has a worldwide reputation across tourism and informing visitors. This is massive for\u00a0Yorkshire and our thousands of amazing tourism businesses, destinations and events.&quot; This latest accolade comes barely a month after Yorkshire was voted European destination 2013 at the World travel awards, beating competition from cities including Amsterdam, Barcelona, Paris, Venice, Istanbul and Edinburgh. The Scottish capital also lost out to Yorkshire in the fight to host next year&apos;s Tour de France Grand D\u00e9part. Edinburgh&apos;s bid was supported by the UK government and British Cycling, but their combined might was no match for Yorkshire chutzpah and self-belief. But it&apos;s worth remembering that not everything in Yorkshire smells of roses of any colour. According to the Office for National Statistics, the percentage of Yorkshire&apos;s population aged 16 to 64 having no qualifications in 2012 was 11.5%, compared with 9.9% for the UK as a whole. The unemployment rate was 8.9% in the second quarter of 2013, compared with 7.8% for the UK. And the famously thrifty residents have less in their wallets then the average Brit, with gross disposable household income (GDHI) of Yorkshire and the Humber residents \u00a313,800 per head in 2011, compared with \u00a316,000 for the UK for the same period.     The Humber Bridge: the fifth-largest single-span suspension bridge in the world. Photograph: Christopher Bailey/Alamy    Sam Jordison, co-author of the book Crap Towns (who grew up over the border in Lancaster), admits that &quot;parts of Yorkshire might have something going for them&quot;. Yet he argues that the Lonely Planet endorsement will only exacerbate Yorkshire&apos;s main problem: &quot;Which is to say, how unbelievably chuffing smug so many of its residents are. York was recently voted the fifth worst place to live in Britain in my Crap Towns survey, primarily because the people there are so very pleased at coming from York. Lonely Planet highlight York Minster as one of\u00a0the\u00a0world&apos;s top 10 &apos;sights to make you feel small&apos;. They omit to include the large number of Geoffrey-Boycottian locals who can do the same without even making you crane\u00a0your\u00a0neck. &quot;The other problem is that you have to be so careful about what part of Yorkshire you go to. Even the prettiest parts have dark secrets. Did you know, for instance, that as well as being the Cath Kidston and net-curtain capital of the UK, Harrogate boasts the most internet-porn-watchers in the UK? And that&apos;s not to mention the biggest drinkers and the highest concentration of drink drivers. We also shouldn&apos;t gloss over the fact that Yorkshire contains places like Bradford. &quot;Bradford has the potential to be great \u2013 but that only makes it all the more galling that it sits at the wrong end of just about every national league table, that its grand Victorian and early-20th-century buildings are under constant threat of demolition, and that there&apos;s a 15-acre hole right in the middle of the city centre. Then there&apos;s Pontefract, a town that Shakespeare called a &apos;bloody prison&apos; even before the liquorice industry died away. And there&apos;s Wakefield. And Keighley ... You get the impression. I suppose I&apos;d be even more perplexed if the Lonely Planet had plumped for somewhere down south. But what&apos;s wrong with the Lake District?&quot; Additional reporting by Lizzie Deane Yorkshire highlights: your must-visit list     Helen Pidd on a visit to Wetwang, where Richard Whiteley was once mayor. Photograph: Helen Pidd    The walk from Sewerby into BridlingtonMy boyfriend&apos;s dad, a typical Yorkshireman and far from sentimental, loves this walk, which runs from the village of Sewerby in east Yorkshire along the coastal path to Bridlington. He likes the inscriptions on the benches looking out to sea, commemorating others who enjoyed the view. We&apos;re ordered to push him off the edge when we&apos;ve had enough of him. The Yorkshire WoldsOften overshadowed by the Dales, the rolling Wolds in East Riding have gained a new audience after featuring in David Hockney&apos;s recent work.

And Huggate (pronounced Hug-it, or more often, &apos;Ug-it), where the best pub chips in the country are served at the Wolds Inn. Todmorden and Hebden\u00a0BridgeLovely valley towns with top-class art scenes, famously well populated by lesbians. Hosts of numerous jamborees, such as the upcoming Lamplighter festival, which will see fire performers, illuminated installations, street bands, shadow puppets and torch-lit belly dancers parade through the pretty streets. SheffieldFriendliest city in Yorkshire \u2013 more humble than Leeds, less twee than York and with a far better music scene than either. Bus drivers call you &quot;duck&quot; and they serve the best hot pork rolls with crackling. HarrogateA bit snooty, yes. But worth a visit for the beautifully restored and fully functioning Turkish baths. The Hole of HorcumA 400ft-deep hollow in the North York Moors that stretches three-quarters of a mile across, said to be made by a giant, who scooped up a large ball of earth and tossed it aside to create a nearby hill, Blakey Topping. Loads of lovely places nearby, including the honestly-not-fictional Great Fryupdale. BradfordIgnore the haters. Yes, there are way too many pawn shops, pound shops and bookies. And yes, there is a big hole where a Westfield shopping centre has failed to materialise. But you won&apos;t find a better curry anywhere else in Yorkshire. I recommend the lamb chops at the Sweet Centre on Lumb Lane.

Suhail Akhtar, 46, and his girlfriend, Dorota Kolasinska, 34, were found dead under rubble after their home in Hounslow was destroyed by the suspected gas mains blast. The couple, who reportedly had been together for about 10 years, were among four people killed as the worst storm to hit the UK for years swept through southern England, leaving a trail of destruction. Kolsinska, who had worked for Hackney council for nine months as a traffic light sequencer, was described as &quot;extremely popular and hardworking&quot;. Kim Wright, corporate director of health and community services at the council in east London, said: &quot;This is a truly tragic incident and our thoughts and sympathies are with Dorota&apos;s family, friends and colleagues.&quot; Those who knew Akhtar, who worked as an IT contractor for the services firm Atos, said they were devastated by the news. A close friend, Sheldon Hawkshaw, told the Evening Standard: &quot;He was a go-to guy. He always had time for everyone. He always made us laugh and will be sorely missed.&quot; A Scotland Yard spokesman said results were awaited from postmortem examinations on the couple. The death total of four from storm-related incidents does not include Dylan Alkins, a 14-year-old swept out to sea from a Sussex beach on Sunday, who remained missing. Hurricane-force winds sweeping across northern Europe raised the toll. Reports said six people were killed in Germany, and a further two drowned off the country&apos;s coast. In the Netherlands, a woman aged 24 was reported to have died after being struck by a falling tree in Amsterdam. In Brittany, a woman was missing, thought swept out to sea, and in Denmark a man was killed when he was hit by a brick. On Tuesday in the UK, as the cleanup operation continued, tens of thousands of homes remained without power two days on. About 50,000 properties in the east and south-east of England were without electricity. on Tuesday evening UK Power Networks said the storm was the biggest the company had coped with since 2002 and had affected power supplies to nearly 620,000 customers. It hoped to get 98% of supplies restored by Wednesday, though some homes could be without until the end of the week. Some rail services were disrupted on Tuesday, but operators said they were expected return to normal by Wednesday. Estimates of the financial damage from the storm, dubbed Saint Jude after the patron of lost causes, on whose day it struck, were not expected until later this week, the Association of British Insurers said. Winds of up to 99mph were recorded at the Needles, Isle of Wight, and up to 6cm (2.4in) of rain, half the monthly average, fell in a just few hours in areas of Hampshire and Devon, causing flash floods. The British Red Cross, which assists power companies during outages, said the storm had prompted one of its largest deployments of personnel for many years. Simon Lewis, head of emergency planning and response, said staff had helped hundreds of vulnerable people who had registered for assistance in the event of an emergency. Lewis said that volunteer staff provided torches and blankets at a Suffolk care home, and in another case boiling water for a mother of five so she could make up formula milk. &quot;Having no power and being in the dark [vulnerable people] need the practical and emotional support and our volunteers can sit with them, talk to them \u2026 and provide them light by torches,&quot; Lewis said. Up to 50 youngsters gathered at West Beach in Newhaven, East Sussex, for a vigil two days after Dylan vanished while playing in the surf. Balloons with hand-written messages were released into the sky and flowers were thrown into the sea in his memory. One of his friends, Aaron Gilbert, 15, said: &quot;I was hoping it was just a bad dream. I woke up crying. We&apos;d come down every day in the summer but I never thought he would come down when it was really rough. I wish I could have stopped him.&quot; Coastguards stood down their rescue operation for Dylan, shifting to trying to recover his body. Another teenager, Bethany Freeman, aged 17, died when she was crushed by a nine-metre (30ft) tree that fell on the caravans she and her family were living in during renovation work at their home in Edenbridge, Kent. Known as Gia, she said to be a universally respected sixth-form pupil at Tunbridge Wells Grammar school, and the school&apos;s website said she had &quot;had everything to look forward to&quot;. Her driving instructor arrived at her home in Lydens Lane to give her a lesson not knowing about the accident. In a statement issued through Kent police, her mother, Tess Peirce, said: &quot;We are all absolutely devastated at the loss of my daughter. I would like to thank the emergency services for their tremendous efforts in attempting to save her.&quot; Another casualty was Donal Drohan, 51, a father of three children, from Harrow in north-west London, who died when his car was hit by a falling tree at the bridge over the River Colne in Watford. Drohan, from Harrow, west London, was &quot;in the wrong place at the wrong time&quot; when his car was struck, police said.

The statue is a monument to the 17th-century philosopher Baruch de Spinoza, who lived nearby. Around the base of the monument, in Dutch, are inscribed the words, &quot;The purpose of the state is freedom&quot;. Spinoza wrote those words in his Theological-Political Treatise of 1670. It is worth reading the words in the context that he used them. The state&apos;s purpose, wrote Spinoza, is &quot;not to dominate or control people by fear or subject them to the authority of another&quot;. On the contrary, he went on, &quot;Its aim is to free everyone from fear so that they may live in security so far as is possible, that is, so that they may retain, to the highest possible degree, their right to live and to act without harm to themselves and others&quot;. Therefore, he concludes (in the modern translation by Michael Silverthorne and Jonathan Israel), &quot;the true purpose of the state is in fact freedom&quot;. That was radical stuff for the often intolerant 1670s. But, more than three centuries on, Spinoza&apos;s words still seem remarkably audacious. What can he possibly mean by them that makes sense in this day and age? How can they be squared, for example, with the actions of America&apos;s National Security Agency, carnivorously chomping its way through the private communications of millions of people around the world and spying on Europe&apos;s leaders too, until Edward Snowden blew the whistle? In what meaningful sense can the US securocrats who testified so unapologetically in Washington this week be said to be advancing not curtailing freedom? In fact the securocrats would probably find less difficulty squaring their activities with Spinoza&apos;s views of the state than many modern citizens may do. The agencies&apos; role, as they see it, is to protect a way of life embodied in the state. In their view, the powers of the state to eavesdrop, gather data and conduct other forms of surveillance are at the service of a larger set of freedoms. In many ways, they are surely right. The problem today is not that the secret state exists. It is that the stupendous scope of its activities seems unethical, indiscriminate and disrespectful of the privacy of the just and good. In the modern era we have become accustomed, especially in the light of 20th-century totalitarian states, to see the state as a threat to freedom rather than its guarantor. On both the left and the right, many reflexively see the state as overly powerful in various ways. The\u00a0internet age has undoubtedly intensified this view. It says: there&apos;s the state over there, with all its powers and controls. And there&apos;s us over here, answerable to it but not part of it. For many people, the idea that we, the people, might actually own the state\u00a0seems bizarre. So the possibility \u2013 but in my view the profound truth set out by Spinoza long ago \u2013 that freedom might be the state&apos;s true purpose takes a bit of digesting. I think that is because we are not in the habit of thinking about\u00a0the state democratically. This problem exists in a particularly characteristic and chronic form in Britain. It does so, in part, because of the continuities of British history. Unlike the state in France, Germany or the US, the British state has rarely had to start from scratch. The ancient power centres of the British state and empire \u2013 the monarchy at its apex, the armed forces which enforce its interests by violence or the threat of it, the security services which protect it from internal threats, even the political and legal institutions which regulate it \u2013 are all evolutionary, inherited and given. We are subject to them, but rarely, if ever, they to us. The age of democracy \u2013 and universal suffrage in Britain is still less than 100 years old \u2013 has not yet recast these power centres in a democratic image. Instead a timid form of democracy has been grafted on to them, in varying degrees. The relationship between democracy and the British state is a set of compromises which allow limited levels of control and transparency. In theory, the monarchy exists because parliament permits it to do so. In reality, the crown is in no real sense democratically shaped \u2013 though it could be. The armed forces answer to the crown and the government, but much less thoroughly to parliament \u2013 votes on wars are very modern and still rare. The security and intelligence services remain at arm&apos;s length from parliament too. The British state has always adapted. It is still doing so. Of course, the monarchy, the armed forces, the security services and parliament all look and are different from the way they looked and were a century ago. But the essence of these institutions has not always changed as much as one may think. Some of them have survived in forms which would have been recognisable to Henry VIII. The purpose of the British state is sometimes simply to protect its own freedom, and not pay much attention to the freedoms of the people. All these issues are alive and real, not abstract or theoretical. But unless the state itself is rooted in democracy, and in citizenship not subjecthood, the relationship between the state and the people is not rooted in a modern conception of freedom. The worship of Prince George, the elevation of the armed services to the status of &quot;heroes&quot; and the denial that the Snowden documents raise issues of over-mighty intrusion, these are all symptoms of a relationship with the state that is rooted more in infantilisation than democracy. A democratic British state would most naturally take the form of a republic, though it could alternatively take the form of a democratic low-key constitutional monarchy too. A democratic British state would place all the important decisions about the deployment of Britain&apos;s armed forces squarely on the shoulders of the elected government, subject to the approval of parliament. And a democratic British state would support the existence and work of the security services, respecting their need for secrecy, but ensuring that parliament exercised proper oversight while balancing privacy and liberty against the genuine demands of national security. Spinoza was profoundly right. The true purpose of the state is, in fact, freedom. That is why the state is fundamental to a safe and good shared life. It&apos;s just that, in a democracy, freedom belongs to all the citizens, not just to those who control the state. And in Britain we do not yet have that kind of freedom.", "sentences": ["As you walk from Rembrandt&apos;s house along the canal towards the town hall of Amsterdam, you come upon a statue of a man wrapped in a large cloak."], "title": "What poppies, Prince George and the NSA tell us about freedom | Martin Kettle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/30/poppies-prince-george-nsa", "tags": ["Politics", "Monarchy", "Prince George", "UK news", "Edward Snowden", "World news", "NSA", "Philosophy", "The NSA files", "Surveillance", "Civil liberties - international"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-10-31T12:18:07Z", "article": "Bill McKibben, founder of the grassroots climate campaigning organisation 350.org, has arrived in the UK on the latest leg of his whistlestop six-day European fossil fuel divestment campaign tour. After visiting Berlin, Oslo and Amsterdam, I caught up with McKibben as he arrived in Edinburgh, before he heads off to Birmingham and then onto London. The divestment campaign is based on the belief that if we are to stay below 2\u00b0C of warming, we cannot emit more than 565 gigatons of carbon dioxide in the future. Fossil fuel companies have more than five times that amount in coal, oil and gas reserves. He believes the campaign is gaining an unstoppable global momentum but recognises that &quot;rogue&quot; fossil fuel companies will only start paying attention when a price is put on carbon. McKibben calls for progressive businesses to take the political initiative on climate change and says investors are finally starting to wake up to the risk of the carbon bubble bursting. Is there as much enthusiasm for the divestment campaign in Europe as you have seen in America? We are seeing a similar level of interest in the campaign and there was an Oxford University study that came out this month showing that this is the fastest growing divestment movement in the planet&apos;s history. I think this buoyed everybody up and to read the Wall Street Journal with the long piece from Al Gore and the London based investment adviser David Blood reminding people that not only does this make moral sense, it also is a practical imperative for investors to get out from under this carbon bubble before it bursts. It feels to me like there&apos;s a lot of momentum. Do you think this can really become a global movement and where do you see it going next? Well this is the third continent that we&apos;re engaged in. In North America we&apos;ve got 380 college campuses, we&apos;ve got big cities like Seattle and San Francisco divesting, big religious denominations. We were in Australia and New Zealand in June. Already some of their big denominations and Anglican dioceses have divested their pension funds, or are taking a serious hard look. So now Europe. I don&apos;t know what the fourth continent will be but I think that the idea by now is just sort of spreading on its own which is what we need movements to do. Our job is to seed things. Every place we&apos;ve been around Europe so far, Berlin, Oslo, Amsterdam; there are lots and lots of local people on the ground ready to take this and run with it. Looking back, were you really expecting the campaign to take off in this way? It is much quicker than we expected. We&apos;d been looking at the case of the divestment movement around apartheid in South Africa and that was very powerful, but it was slow. It took eight or ten years of campaigning. It may be that people realise that in this case we just don&apos;t have eight or ten years to spare. So, people seem to be going to work with a vengeance. While you have got religious groups, universities and a few cities on board, what will it take to really take the campaign into the mainstream? I think the most important thing is getting this analysis out into the information blood stream about the fact that most of the carbon in the world has to stay underground. When we started a year ago it was a report from the Carbon Tracker Initiative and a piece that I wrote for Rolling Stone, neither of which were likely to move the world. But the analysis has now spread to the point where the World Bank, the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and just about everybody else has said that we have to leave at least two thirds of the carbon we know about underground. That&apos;s telling. That will have an effect. Do you think that the fossil fuel companies think of you as more than just a flea on their shoulder? I&apos;ve got no idea what they think. They haven&apos;t been very pressing so far about dealing with reality; they&apos;ve attempted to deny for a very long time that there was trouble with climate change or that they would have to change their business model to deal with it. So far they&apos;ve had enough money to pretty much own our political system and keep them from having to change but you know, people are beginning to catch onto their game and we&apos;ll see. It&apos;s obviously going to be a very hard battle because they have more money than any industry in history. Are there any conditions under which you would start talking directly to the fossil fuel industry or do you think this is basically a battle from the outside? I think they&apos;ll be more than willing to talk the day after there&apos;s a serious price on carbon around the world. That&apos;ll be the day that they decide to become energy companies, not fossil fuel companies and then it&apos;ll be a great pleasure to talk with them and watch them put their considerable skills to work for the future instead of against it. But that&apos;s not going to happen without serious political action and that will only happen when we&apos;re able to weaken their power enough to get the policy change we need. You say they&apos;re incredibly powerful, so how are you going to move to the next stage of &quot;politically bankrupting them?&quot; Well we&apos;re in early days yet with this campaign and we&apos;ll see. We think it&apos;s one front but there will be many others. Every bad project that they come up with people are challenging with increasing effectiveness. What do you think those other fronts might look like? I&apos;m not completely sure. I think we&apos;ll see how much momentum it gets. I have a feeling that one of the keys will be that it will begin to really affect how investors view these operations. I mean HSBC said in their big study in all of this, if we ever took the two degree target seriously, the valuations of these companies would be cut in half. That&apos;s the moment at which change will start to come. There are a number of progressive businesses that recognise the dangers ahead if we do not change direction. What do you think they should be doing? Our job isn&apos;t so much to bring them on board. If we create the commotion and the space, others will do that work, and you can see it happening already. Ceres coordinated a letter last week from the thirty biggest pension funds in the US to the fossil fuel industry asking them about those valuations and what it meant that they had unburnable carbon in their reserves, so that&apos;s starting to happen and it&apos;s good news. I think one of the big problems is that the rest of the business community has left it up to the fossil fuel industry to talk about climate change. And that&apos;s crazy because this is clearly a challenge for everyone, on every front. What we need them to do is get involved in this fight politically and stand up to the fossil fuel industry and just say &apos;you do not speak for business, not in the least&apos;. How do you see your tactics developing? We use all different kinds of tactics. We did the largest civil disobedience action in thirty years about Keystone in the United States and that&apos;s great. But you don&apos;t want to use the same tool every time or it gets dull. We&apos;ll do it when it&apos;s appropriate and if we end up sitting-in outside shareholder meetings then that&apos;s the way we&apos;ll do it, but our goal always is effectiveness. What have you learnt about the most effective way to communicate your message? Most important is having things in a concrete form that people can understand. I wrote the first book about all this 25 years ago and I didn&apos;t have that understanding in my head that the way to think about it was that we needed to leave these reserves in the ground. Once one sees the numbers then a number of logical conclusions follow. When you go around and meet people what is their mood? Are people angry? Are they frustrated? Are they excited? People are excited by anything that seems to offer the possibility for effective action. The problem with climate change always has been and always will be, that it&apos;s so big that it seems difficult to see how as individuals we&apos;re going to have a major effect. When we can conceive campaigns that allow people to understand how they might actually make a difference then in our experience people are ready to go. What are your plans from here?

Centring on independent labels such as Erased Tapes, New Amsterdam Records and 13071, neo-classical&apos;s musicians are often young (figureheads Nils Frahm, Nico Muhly, Peter Broderick and Olafur Arnalds were all born after 1981) and approach the music with the same creative drive you&apos;d expect from a generation who grew up with MTV, clubbing and an internet connection. Elements of indie rock, ambient, hip-hop and dance crop up in their songs. Frahm flits between delicate piano compositions and solo synth outings that highlight his background as an electronic producer, while Arnalds works skittering beats into his gentle, stirring piano and string pieces, and used to play drums in the hardcore band Fighting Shit. Venue choice is crucial to the success of neo-classical, and artists seem as comfortable performing in bars and nightclubs as they do in concert halls. East London promoters Nonclassical present their showcases as if they were rock gigs, hosting a monthly club night at The Macbeth, where punters watch virtuosic musicians through a pub PA, pint in hand. It&apos;s not unusual for a warehouse such as Bethnal Green&apos;s Oval Space to host the London Contemporary Orchestra, while A Winged Victory For The Sullen recently previewed their score to Wayne McGregor&apos;s ballet Atomos on a tour of UK clubs.

Tate Liverpool and Turner Contemporary in Margate on Friday announced details of separate shows to be staged next summer, timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Dutch artist&apos;s death. Victoria Pomery, the director of Turner Contemporary, said Mondrian &quot;was one of the greatest artists of the 20th century and his influence has been absolutely enormous. We see it today in fashion and design \u2013 he was a tremendously important figure.&quot; The Margate show will examine the importance of colour during the artist&apos;s early career, while the Liverpool exhibition will explore his practice, his relationship with architecture and &quot;his contribution to the development of modern thought&quot;. Tate Liverpool&apos;s artistic director, Francesco Manacorda, said: &quot;Mondrian changed the way that art functioned, he changed the nature of what painting can be. I love him because I think his paintings are sculptures, they are objects that inhabit the world.&quot; Mondrian was born Mondriaan in 1872 and studied in Amsterdam before moving to Paris in 1911, where he also dropped his second &apos;a&apos;. It was here that the eager-to-learn artist, influenced by Cubists such as Picasso and Braque, broke away from representational painting. By 1921 Mondrian had decided to paint only in primary colours and began to hone his abstract grid style. In Margate visitors will be able to see the less well-known, earlier side of Mondrian with examples of his representational work including landscapes and farmhouses and seminal grid works . Pomery said people might be surprised and also they look so different up close than they would on a screen &quot;The intensity of the colour in his earlier works is extraordinary,&quot; she said. &quot;In this exhibition we are really seeking to investigate his entire oeuvre and how important colour was to achieve his quest for the universal.&quot; As well as more than 50 works loaned by collections in Europe \u2013 in particular from the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag in The Hague, home to the largest Mondrian collection in the world \u2013 and the US, the gallery wants to transform Margate itself with what Pomery called a &quot;festival of colour&quot;. This will involve schools and businesses, although she admitted plans were still sketchy. &quot;We are working to make something very exciting happen, we&apos;re not quite sure what that&apos;s going to be yet, but we want a celebration of colour.&quot; The places where Mondrian worked were incredibly important to him and in Liverpool visitors will be able to explore a full-scale reconstruction of Mondrian&apos;s studio at 26 Rue du D\u00e9part, Paris. Manacorda said: &quot;His studio was a place where a lot of things were in flux, where things were changing. You can see colours and lines which he moved around to experiment.&quot; Manacorda said it would allow people to see Mondrian&apos;s work in a different way and also understand what he saw as his artistic mission, expressed in works such as No VI/Composition No 11 from 1920. &quot;People will be able to step into this architectural setting and time travel back to the beginning of the 20th century and possibly have something similar to the revelation that visitors to Mondrian&apos;s studio had.&quot; The show will include drawings from a 1914 series called Pier and Ocean and will have particular resonance because visitors will be able to look at them and then out of the window at the beautiful real views of the former Cunard liner piers. There is an extra poignancy because it was Liverpool that Mondrian departed Europe for the US, leaving on the Cunard White Star Lines ship Samaria on 23 September 1940. The two galleries decided to mark the Mondrian anniversary by coincidence, although both realised the other&apos;s intentions early enough to make a virtue of it. They officially launched the shows at the Dutch embassy in London, an appropriate place said Pomery as shows of this type, dealing with fragile works and multiple lenders, were &quot;incredibly difficult to organise and orchestrate, they&apos;re great fun to think about and conceive but the logistics can be slightly nightmarish and be more like diplomatic duties.&quot; Manacorda said: &quot;Individually these exhibitions are exceptional and explore elements of Mondrian&apos;s work that have never been discussed before. Together they will tell the complete story of the artist, his influences and his legacy. Whether you live in the north or the south of the UK the British public will have access to work that will take them on a journey of his artistic career and allow them to get beneath the grid and understand more.&quot; \u2022 Mondrian and Colour will be at Turner Contemporary in Margate from 24 May to 21 September while Mondrian and his Studios will be at Tate Liverpool 6 June to 5 October.

In the immediate aftermath of his team&apos;s 2-1 success, Neil Lennon expressed relief that the &quot;reputation&quot; of Celtic had been preserved. Earlier in their Group H campaign, Celtic had lost narrowly to Milan and then Barcelona. &quot;What I meant by that was that we hadn&apos;t any points out of the first two games,&quot; Lennon says. &quot;If you go three games without any points then it doesn&apos;t look great. We feel we are a good European team now and we wanted to keep that reputation intact. Beating Ajax, I think, has done that.&quot; It has also refuelled Celtic&apos;s ambitions of reaching the last 16 for what would be a second season in succession. Wednesday&apos;s return fixture in Amsterdam is unquestionably crucial to both clubs. &quot;I don&apos;t want to tempt fate because you could end up getting a drubbing from one of these teams sooner rather than later but the one thing we wanted to be was competitive in the group and we have certainly done that,&quot; Lennon says. &quot;There has been nothing that much in the games although they are class teams, there is no question they have class players. And the difference sometimes is you get what you pay for.&quot; Still, Lennon scoffs when it is put to him that his players may have no right to achieve success against more illustrious sides. Such determination has served Celtic well in Europe. &quot;Why can&apos;t we be a good team in the Champions League? Just because we play in Scotland?,&quot; Lennon asks. &quot;Listen, there is no question we are punching above our weight but why not? We are in the competition and we crave it. Everyone in this room [the press] craves it. The fans crave it, the people in Scotland crave it as do me as a manager and the players. It&apos;s the be all and end all, really. It is the premier one and I don&apos;t want to go out. I want to qualify. &quot;It&apos;s good, the players are turning heads. The last couple of years now have given great exposure to the club. It&apos;s good for the reputation of the game here as well, I think.&quot; Celtic&apos;s cause at the Amsterdam Arena will be boosted by the return of Kris Commons from injury. There is also the spectre of growing heat on Frank De Boer&apos;s young Ajax side, who have so far failed to endorse domestic success by making meaningful inroads in Europe. Ajax have won only one of their past 11 Champions League outings. &quot;Last time Ajax came without pressure because we had to win at home but the pressure is all back to them now,&quot; insists the Celtic defender Efe Ambrose. Lennon agrees with such sentiment while cautioning that Ajax now have the bonus of home advantage. The Northern Irishman is, moreover, continually nonplussed by the assertions of De Boer and his players that they dominated proceedings despite defeat at Celtic Park. &quot;They are going to say that,&quot; Lennon says, shrugging. &quot;Everybody says that when they play us. You can see it from their point of view but you should see it from our point of view, as well. &quot;I thought we deserved to win the game. Frank will say they deserved to win it. I don&apos;t think there is much between the teams. I hope again that is the case on Wednesday, that we keep our nerve and that we play like we can. &quot;And don&apos;t forget we had a lot of players missing in the last game. We really shuffled things around, which was difficult so it made the win even more special.&quot; Another one would prove even more so, and equally valuable to Celtic&apos;s latest knockout plan.", "sentences": ["Wednesday&apos;s return fixture in Amsterdam is unquestionably crucial to both clubs.", "It&apos;s good for the reputation of the game here as well, I think.&quot; Celtic&apos;s cause at the Amsterdam Arena will be boosted by the return of Kris Commons from injury."], "title": "Neil Lennon seeks lift-off as Celtic crave Champions League success", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/02/neil-lennon-celtic-champions-league", "tags": ["Celtic", "Neil Lennon", "Ajax", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-02T17:57:52Z", "article": "Celtic limped and laboured through this match. They maintained an unbeaten league record, though, as Charlie Mulgrew&apos;s stoppage time header denied Dundee United a first win at this venue in 21 years. An impressive United could reasonably claim to have been hard done by. The attentions of Celtic and Neil Lennon now revert to a pivotal Champions League meeting with Ajax in midweek. It would be a surprise if Celtic are as tepid in the Netherlands as they were here. If such failings do re-occur, Ajax will prevail. Anthony Stokes, playing in his first match since signing a three-year contract extension, was Celtic&apos;s most lively scoring threat during this draw. Stokes had passed up two decent chances by the time United threatened through Brian Graham, who watched a close-range header batted away by Fraser Forster. Generally, though, Celtic&apos;s impetus was blunted by the absence of Georgios Samaras and Kris Commons. Both are expected to return for Wednesday&apos;s match in Amsterdam but encounters such as this one demonstrate that Lennon hardly has the luxury of resting key players before big games. There is much work to be done, for example, if Stokes and Amido Bald\u00e9 are to emerge as a potent strike partnership even at domestic level. Bald\u00e9 lasted 61 minutes against United, only succeeding in looking about as dangerous as a water pistol during that time. There was no risk taken against United with Beram Kayal, who is likely to replace the suspended captain Scott Brown against Ajax. Instead, the Israeli midfielder was left amongst the Celtic substitutes. Brown&apos;s stupidity in kicking Barcelona Neymar, and the three-game suspension that arrived as a consequence, may yet undermine Lennon&apos;s dreams of taking Celtic to the Champions League&apos;s last 16 once again. Joe Ledley faced United and whilst recent injury problems offer a part explanation, is failing to perform anywhere close to his best. Ledley, like Bald\u00e9, was replaced in the second half. Such matters of Celtic selection were of no consequence to United as they earned a 38th-minute lead. Nadir Ciftci created headlines after his involvement in a rumpus during a League Cup defeat in Inverness on Tuesday night. The forward could, it is reported, be subject to a 16-match ban if all manner of charges against him are proven. In any case, Ciftci displayed the admirable side of his football personality by playing a wonderful pass into the feet of Stuart Armstrong. The United midfielder showed fine composure, and justified his standing as one of Scottish football&apos;s brightest prospects, to beat the onrushing Forster. That visitors&apos; goal roused Celtic. They could have been level by the interval but Graham blocked a fierce James Forrest drive on his goal-line and Stokes was wasteful with two separate chances. Graham should have afforded United breathing space, 20 minutes after the break. Instead, the former Raith Rovers forward was guilty of a quite extraordinary miss. Graham wears a brand of football boots endorsed by Pele; the Brazilian great would have worried about product reputation damage had he seen the United player head the ball against himself, rather than into the net, from six yards. Ciftci was again the creator. If Radoslaw Cierzniak in the United goal feared a late onslaught, he need not have. Stokes had a near-post flick saved before Mulgrew tamely headed home. Given how strong the United backline had been until that point, they will feel aggrieved at losing two points in such a cheap manner.", "sentences": ["Both are expected to return for Wednesday&apos;s match in Amsterdam but encounters such as this one demonstrate that Lennon hardly has the luxury of resting key players before big games."], "title": "Celtic 1-1 Dundee United | Scottish Premiership match report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/02/celtic-dundee-united-scottish-premiership", "tags": ["Scottish Premiership", "Celtic", "Dundee United", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-04T06:00:00Z", "article": "Escapism New tour operator Miraviva is tipping M\u00e1ncora, a small fishing village in northern Peru, as a hotspot.

Investigators from Terre des Hommes Netherlands said they had snared 110 internet users in the UK after posing as a 10-year-old girl named Sweetie in public chatrooms described as havens for child predators. Personal details of the 110 men were handed to Interpol on Monday following the sting, which investigators said identified 1,000 people from 65 countries who had attempted to solicit underage girls using webcams. At a press conference in The Hague, the group&apos;s director of campaigns, Hans Guyt, outlined what he described as a new phenomenon of webcam child sex tourism. &quot;We are convinced that if we don&apos;t publish our research on this phenomenon now, it will only get worse. It will turn into a multibillion-pound industry in the hands of criminal gangs. We want to make sure that doesn&apos;t happen,&quot; Guyt said. Researchers said they were swamped by offers from 20,000 internet users to pay for webcam sex performances when they posed in chatrooms as Sweetie, supposedly a 10-year-old Filipina girl. A 10-week investigation conducted from a warehouse in Amsterdam tracked down 1,000 of these users and uncovered personal details including their real names, addresses and telephone numbers. It found that 110 of the alleged online abusers were based in the UK and another 254 were traced to computers in the US. The researchers said online child exploitation was becoming a hardened criminal industry in the Philippines, with tens of thousands of children estimated to be victims. &quot;These people think they&apos;re invisible. They think they&apos;re untouchable. They think that no one is watching,&quot; said Guyt. &quot;This demonstrates how widespread the phenomenon is already. The only way to find these people is to look for them \u2013 a new approach, an active form of policing.&quot; In a 60-page report described as the most comprehensive study to date on child exploitation using webcams, the researchers say their findings represent a small fraction of abuse happening each day. They call for a radical change in policing to proactively try to track down the people attempting to solicit children online. Guyt said: &quot;We have collected evidence and presented our findings, which have led us to the conclusion that if proactive investigation policies are not immediately and widely adopted, the phenomenon of webcam child sex tourism will continue to grow into a larger, more criminalised, more intractable industry within the Philippines and in other countries where poverty persists and internet access rates are rising. &quot;The biggest problem is that the police don&apos;t take action until child victims file reports, but children almost never report these crimes. These children are usually forced to do this by adults or by extreme poverty. Sometimes they have to testify against their own family, which is almost an impossible thing to do for a child. The child predators doing this now feel that the law does not apply to them. The internet is free, but not lawless.&quot; Only six people have been convicted over crimes relating to webcam child sex tourism, according to the researchers.

During one of Mozart&apos;s trickiest quintets, the platform on which the singers are standing shudders and tilts up like the hull of a\u00a0sinking ship. The Queen of the Night&apos;s three attendants, who&apos;ve been\u00a0trying to lure Prince Tamino, the\u00a0hero, and his sidekick Papageno back to the dark side, slide towards oblivion \u2013 singing as they go. And then\u00a0there&apos;s the Queen of the Night herself. With its breakneck coloratura and high Fs, her showpiece aria \u2013 The\u00a0Vengeance of Hell Boils in My Heart \u2013 is hard enough to sing while standing still. But here, she&apos;s rolling around in a wheelchair, wielding a knife and being pawed by her errant\u00a0daughter, as does the impressive Cornelia G\u00f6tz. So why is the Queen of the Night in\u00a0a\u00a0wheelchair? &quot;There are lots of paradoxes in Mozart,&quot; says McBurney. &quot;She says she&apos;s losing her power. But\u00a0then she goes on to sing one of the\u00a0most demanding arias in opera. So\u00a0if we&apos;re to treat what she says seriously, the question becomes how\u00a0do we physically show her growing powerlessness?I thought the wheelchair would do that. By the end of\u00a0the opera, she can hardly move.&quot; McBurney, the award-winning 56-year-old founder of Complicite theatre company, who&apos;s appeared in\u00a0The Vicar of Dibley and Rev, and had\u00a0screen roles in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Harry Potter, came late\u00a0to opera, and even later to Mozart.\u00a0 &quot;For years, I wasn&apos;t in the least bit interested in opera,&quot; he tells me over\u00a0a\u00a0post-rehearsal drink. &quot;The productions were so wooden, the plots\u00a0so fucking obscure, everything so\u00a0fucking pointless. And I never got Mozart. I thought he was light, frothy,\u00a0insubstantial.&quot; With all due respect, I say, that&apos;s nuts. &quot;I know. I&apos;m very slow and stupid, so I only gradually understand what&apos;s going on.&quot; He removes his baseball cap,\u00a0and orders more crisps and a second glass of Talisker whisky. &quot;Mozart&apos;s seeming frothiness is just a\u00a0light touch with very profound material. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve found working on The Magic Flute.&quot; You didn&apos;t know this before you started work on it? &quot;No. It&apos;s always like that for\u00a0me: a journey where you don&apos;t know where you&apos;re heading.&quot; That must be interesting for your actors and\u00a0singers. &quot;Interesting, yes.

Simon McBurney in rehearsal at English National Opera, October 2013. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    What audiences will see later this week in McBurney&apos;s Magic Flute is the\u00a0ancien regime dying before them and the European Enlightenment struggling to be born. The wobbling, tilting, swinging, hovering platform is a visual metaphor for\u00a0humanity in crisis. After the Queen of the Night&apos;s attendants tumble off, the platform rights itself like a mechanised flying carpet, and Tamino and Papageno head off to endure further ordeals before they can get their girls and achieve enlightenment. &quot;The Magic Flute, I think, is fundamentally asking what is it to change people&apos;s consciousness,&quot; says McBurney. &quot;What makes it evolve? This was an important question when this was first performed two years after the French revolution - and now. When we performed this in Amsterdam we got a big laugh when Sarastro says we&apos;re in a crisis. We were in 1791 and we are now.&quot; On stage, Papageno is wondering aloud why he can&apos;t just get the girl without having to go through all this\u00a0fuss: trials by fire and water, plus\u00a0lewd propositions from scantily clad regal lickspittles. The opera&apos;s answer seems to be that you aren&apos;t in the Garden of Eden any more, sunshine, you&apos;re in a modern world where you don&apos;t pull fruit from the trees or immediately receive the object of your sexual desire, but have to suffer, struggle and use your wits and rationality to get what you want. Even then there&apos;s no guarantee of success. Yet the struggle is is our predicament, what makes us human rather than animal. This is the\u00a0vision that fires McBurney. &quot;The opera is politically, philosophically and\u00a0musically profound,&quot; he says. &quot;And sexual. I just got a text from Stephen Fry saying, &apos;Good luck with your flute. Oo-er.&apos; Zauberfl\u00f6te is German slang for penis. The opera&apos;s original audiences in 1791, when Die Zauberfl\u00f6te premiered in Vienna, would have immediately grasped a lot\u00a0of the resonances we struggle to understand. They&apos;d have recognised the Queen of the Night&apos;s coloratura singing as old-fashioned, and her rival Sarastro&apos;s singing as something more modern. In a sense, she&apos;s the dying ancien regime, and he&apos;s the new dawn. They&apos;d have got that political subtext from the music.&quot; Traditionally, says McBurney, the second half of The Magic Flute was so dull you might nod off. It is unlikely to\u00a0happen here. The pacing is snappy, the production dense with multimedia effects. A sound-effects artist in a glass chamber stage right makes a rustling noise echoed centre-stage as Papageno fumbles with a sweet wrapper. A video\u00a0artist stage left projects images and directs the singers with arrows that appear behind them on a screen. And when the singers speak, they are mic-ed up so they can move more freely around the stage yet still be heard. When they sing, though, the mics are turned off. The sound design alone makes it one of the most technically virtuosic operas ever put\u00a0on in London. &quot;It&apos;s the most demanding production we&apos;ve ever staged,&quot; says ENO artistic director John Berry. This co-production with De Nederlandse Opera (their engineers built the amazing hydraulic system) was performed in Amsterdam to rave reviews last year and now Berry is hoping for similar success. Berry is the man responsible for attempting to revive ENO by luring in celebrated directors (Terry Gilliam, Rufus Norris, Mike Figgis and of course McBurney) to work in opera for the first time. He&apos;s also the man who smiles when I mention the boos that Calixto Bieito&apos;s Fidelio got at ENO recently: &quot;Part of the territory.&quot; It was Pierre Audi \u2013 former artistic director of London&apos;s Almeida and since 1988 artistic director of De Nederlandse Opera \u2013 who first persuaded McBurney to face down his operatic prejudice, proposing that he direct an adaptation of Mikhail Bulgakov&apos;s absurdist novel Heart of a Dog in a DNO-ENO co-production in 2010. &quot;I love Russian literature,&quot; says McBurney, &quot;and I adore Bulgakov. I&apos;ve long been fascinated by that pre-war Soviet era.&quot; Indeed, that fascination has yielded some of his and Complicite&apos;s best work, notably 1994&apos;s adaptation of Daniil Kharms&apos;s Out of a House Walked a Man (with an original score composed by his Russophile musicologist brother Gerard) and 2011&apos;s adaptation of The Master and Margarita. &quot;Once Pierre had got me sucked into opera, he kept mentioning The Magic Flute, saying I&apos;d get a kick out of directing it. I thought, &apos;Bollocks.&apos; Other opera directors warned me off, saying they couldn&apos;t see how to make it work.&quot;  So\u00a0how is he making his production work? &quot;My proposition is that music is at the heart\u00a0of what The Magic Flute means, that it&apos;s Mozart&apos;s music, not the words, we should be attending to. Music expresses what can&apos;t be expressed otherwise. It reminds me of the music\u00a0of the Chukchi people of north-eastern Siberia.&quot; Really? He gives me a sidelong glance. &quot;Oh yes. Really.&quot; McBurney recommends I listen to his choices for\u00a0Radio 4&apos;s Desert Island Discs last\u00a0year. Not I&apos;m the Slime by Frank Zappa (though that is superb) or the fifth movement of Schnittke&apos;s Concerto Grosso (ditto), but throat singer Veronica\u00a0Oucholin&apos;s rendition of I Light\u00a0the Fire. At the time he told presenter Kirsty Young: &quot;I understood through my father [the late American archaeologist Charles McBurney] that\u00a0in neolithic times, humans felt\u00a0they were part of the world of animals and echoes of that time the vestiges, can\u00a0still be heard today, which is why I&apos;ve chosen this piece from the Chukchi people.&quot; What&apos;s that got to do with Mozart? &quot;It&apos;s very simple. Mozart is saying: that which cannot be articulated otherwise can be expressed in music. The magic flute changes people and so\u00a0do the bells. It&apos;s the great prophetic opera. All this is taken on by Beethoven, Wagner, Hitler, Stalin, maybe even the Beatles.&quot; So now McBurney is in love with the\u00a0art form he disdained. He and Argentine composer Osvaldo Golijov are currently trying to create a libretto for an opera about which he will tell me nothing. &quot;I&apos;m also planning to do operas with Damon Albarn and the Pet\u00a0Shop Boys, and maybe something involving Beethoven.&quot;     The wobbling, tilting, swinging, hovering platform - a visual metaphor for humanity in crisis.  Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    But first Mozart. It would be absurd to judge a production on a single rehearsal, but one impressive and symbolic thing McBurney has done is to raise the orchestra from the pit to a level where the audience can actually see it. For once you&apos;ll be able to study the first clarinettist&apos;s dandruff from the cheap seats. It was Wagner at Bayreuth who first shoved his musicians into the Nibelheim-like bowels of the Earth. &quot;For Wagner,&quot; says McBurney, &quot;that was about mysticism. I want to do the opposite \u2013 to take the audience from darkness to light, to make us evolve, to end mystification and embrace reason and rationality. That, as I understand it, is what the opera is about.&quot;", "sentences": ["When we performed this in Amsterdam we got a big laugh when Sarastro says we&apos;re in a crisis.", "This co-production with De Nederlandse Opera (their engineers built the amazing hydraulic system) was performed in Amsterdam to rave reviews last year and now Berry is hoping for similar success."], "title": "Simon McBurney: The Age of Enlightenment", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/04/simon-mcburney-mozart-magic-flute-english-national-opera", "tags": ["Classical music", "Opera", "Simon McBurney", "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "Music", "Stage", "Culture", "English National Opera (ENO)"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-04T23:00:01Z", "article": "Gordon Strachan has insisted Celtic can defeat Ajax in Wednesday&apos;s crucial Champions League match and offer a boost to his Scotland team in the process.

The Ajax team will develop; they look like a youth team \u2013 I don&apos;t think anybody has had a shave in that team. When you look at them and the Juventus team Celtic played last season, they were men. &quot;The Ajax team will develop in the next nine months, a year, into an exceptional team again. Ajax&apos;s problem, like most clubs, is they keep improving players then somebody buys them. &quot;At the moment I think Celtic have the strength and the knowhow to definitely get a result there, because Ajax are not in the best of form just now. And they can definitely beat AC Milan.&quot; Strachan offered his thoughts as he named his Scotland squad for the upcoming friendlies against the United States and Norway. Three Celtic players \u2013 James Forrest, Scott Brown and Charlie Mulgrew \u2013 are in that party. &quot;There&apos;s absolutely no doubt about it, Celtic&apos;s experience in the Champions League has helped Scottish international football,&quot; Strachan said. &quot;Thinking back five or six years ago when Rangers were on a good run and got to the Uefa Cup final, that added to the Scotland squad as well. &quot;Apart from Celtic, the players don&apos;t have European football, which is a pity. I&apos;m sure if they had it, they would definitely get better. &quot;It&apos;s not an arrogance, it&apos;s a confidence you feel. When you might have thought: &apos;Am I good enough?&apos; It becomes: &apos;Yes, I am good enough.&apos; &quot;I would love to get players with that experience staying in Europe longer. How to deal with it, things like travelling all the time and getting used to having less training sessions.&quot; Strachan also explained how he will wait until Darren Fletcher is back in Manchester United&apos;s first team before re-selecting him for the international stage. Fletcher, the Scotland captain, has played only 13 matches since December 2011 as he battles a serious bowel condition. The midfielder did feature, though, for United&apos;s under-21 team last week and is closing in on a first-team comeback. &quot;I think we just leave him,&quot; said Strachan. &quot;The thing I&apos;m looking for is his first game with the United first team and that will signal to us that then we come on board.&quot;", "sentences": ["Celtic head to the Amsterdam ArenA for a fixture they must realistically take at least a point from if they are to progress from Group H.

This year was officially designated as Netherlands-Russia year, planned as 12 months of affirming friendly bilateral ties, cultural exchange and improved business links between the countries. Instead, the King of the Netherlands arrives in Moscow this week \u2013 to wind up the year&apos;s &quot;festivities&quot; \u2013 with Dutch environmental activists in jail, a Dutch ship seized by the Russians and the deputy head of the Dutch diplomatic mission in Moscow assaulted inside his home in a vindictive, homophobic \u2013 and perhaps professional \u2013 attack. The year of diplomatic disasters got off to a bad start when Vladimir Putin visited Amsterdam in April. The city&apos;s mayor snubbed Russia&apos;s president, sending a deputy to meet him instead and flying a rainbow flag at city hall to protest against Russia&apos;s controversial legislation banning &quot;homosexual propaganda&quot;. Thousands of locals took to the streets close to where Putin was holding official meetings. &quot;I don&apos;t think there has been any city in the world where Putin has visited and the mayor deliberately refused to show up,&quot; said Derk Sauer, a Dutch businessman and newspaper publisher who has lived in Moscow for more than two decades. &quot;He was insulted to his core, and for a couple of weeks afterwards there was a non-stop campaign on Russian TV showing Holland to be a modern Sodom and Gomorrah, run by paedophiles and hashish dealers.&quot; Even purely cultural events arranged as part of the year of friendship have not been scandal-free. The Dutch culture minister, Jet Bussemaker, attended an opening of a major exhibition of Piet Mondrian works in Moscow in September at the State Tretyakov gallery but used the occasion to condemn Russia&apos;s record on human and gay rights, telling the Russians artistic freedom is impossible without human freedoms. Her Russian counterpart, Vladimir Medinsky, was forced to listen, and made little secret of his disgust. &quot;It was clear that Medinsky was boiling with anger,&quot; said a source who was at the event. &quot;He said literally two words, did not properly look at the exhibit, and stormed out.&quot; Things really began to get nasty in October, when Dutch police briefly arrested Dmitry Borodin, No\u00a02 at the Russian embassy in The Hague, after neighbours complained of drunken behaviour. Dutch reports suggested Borodin and his wife were inebriated. The Russians dismissed the claims and said he was assaulted by police with no legitimate reason. Putin demanded a Dutch apology, saying Borodin had diplomatic immunity and the incident had violated the Vienna convention. A foreign ministry spokesman described the detention as &quot;incomprehensible and unacceptable&quot;. Ten days later, Borodin&apos;s opposite number in the Dutch embassy in Moscow, Onno Elderenbosch, was attacked in his flat by intruders who daubed LGBT in red lipstick on a mirror. Dutch media reported that Elderenbosch is gay. Russia&apos;s foreign ministry promised to search for the attackers, but no progress has been announced in the investigation. A spokesperson at the Dutch embassy refused to comment on the incident or the progress of the investigation. While no Dutch official has openly accused Russian officials or security services of complicity in the attack, privately there is suspicion that it was not a random occurrence. It had the hallmarks of a planned, professional operation and nothing was stolen from the flat. &quot;You have to be extremely naive to think these were just two random guys going for a beer who decided to break into the diplomat&apos;s house,&quot; said Sauer. &quot;It appears to have been very carefully organised.&quot; Yet more bad blood between the nations resulted from the arrest of all those on the Arctic Sunrise, the Greenpeace ship sailing under a Dutch flag to protest against Russia&apos;s Arctic oil drilling programme. The 28 Greenpeace activists and two freelance journalists have been charged with hooliganism as part of an organised group and face seven years in jail. Two of them are Dutch citizens. The Arctic Sunrise is under armed guard in the Arctic port of Murmansk and the Dutch government is bringing a case against Russia at the international tribunal for the law of the sea, due to be heard this week. Two parliamentary debates were held in the Netherlands before it was decided the king&apos;s visit should go ahead. But his trip could still come unstuck over the gay issue. The leading Dutch orchestra, the Royal Concertgebouw, will play at the Moscow Conservatory on Friday, watched by the king and possibly Putin. The orchestra voted not to mention gay rights during the concert, but individual instrumentalists may still make personal protests \u2013 such as wearing rainbow colours. King Willem-Alexander is seen as a consummate diplomat who is unlikely to make waves when he meets Putin. Instead, the focus is likely to be economic. The king will be accompanied by Dutch ministers and businessmen \u2013 the Netherlands is Russia&apos;s biggest trade partner in the EU. Nevertheless, there is extreme unease in the Netherlands about the timing of the visit. &quot;Unless Putin releases the Greenpeace guys before Friday, we will have a situation where the King of Holland comes here to strengthen friendship with Russia while at the same time you have Dutch citizens sitting in jail and a Dutch ship seized,&quot; said Sauer. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2013.

Forster&apos;s consistently excellent form, particularly in Europe, coupled with Joe Hart&apos;s troubles seem to have created the perfect storm for the Celtic custodian. Neil Lennon believes Forster will be handed a first cap by Roy Hodgson in the upcoming matches against Chile and Germany, with the Football Association sending a scout to watch Forster in Amsterdam. And Lennon has urged his goalkeeper not to stop there. &quot;Three years ago there is no way you would have envisaged Fraser being in the England squad,&quot; Lennon said. &quot;But he has just improved year in and year out. I have said this to him already. I said, &apos;You have just got to stay in the moment now.&apos; Just keep this form going at this level and I can&apos;t see him not being picked for one of the friendlies coming up. I think he deserves the opportunity regardless of Joe&apos;s form. I think Roy has intimated that Fraser will get an opportunity anyway. &quot;I don&apos;t want to put extra pressure on Fraser by saying, &apos;You have to play well.&apos; I think he is really in a good place. I have said before I don&apos;t want this to be a short-term thing for him. I want it to be a long-term thing for five, six, seven years of him being England&apos;s No1 or No2.&quot; On the eve of Celtic&apos;s crucial Champions League match against Ajax in Amsterdam, Lennon was understandably reluctant to discuss Hodgson&apos;s relationship with Hart. &quot;If Joe was playing brilliantly, Fraser still should get the opportunity. But then it&apos;s not up to me, it&apos;s up to Roy,&quot; Lennon said. &quot;Joe has played very well for him throughout the whole [World Cup] tournament and you need to show a bit of loyalty to your No1 at times. No matter if they have a rocky period or not. &quot;But Roy did intimate before the last group games that he may look at Fraser for these two friendlies. That&apos;s for the future. I need him at his best [against Ajax] and he seems to thrive in this environment.&quot; Forster&apos;s continued presence in a Celtic shirt has been pivotal to Lennon&apos;s hopes of guiding his team to the last 16 for the second year in a row. The summer sales of Gary Hooper and Victor Wanyama impacted on Celtic&apos;s strength. Hooper, most pertinently, doesn&apos;t look to have been adequately replaced. &quot;It has been a lot more difficult,&quot; Lennon conceded. &quot;When you lose a 30-goal-a-year striker, and Wanyama was a huge player. But we have come up to the plate so far.&quot; Yet after beating Ajax 2-1 in Glasgow a fortnight ago, Celtic know a repeat result and a win over Milan in their penultimate group match should be enough to send them through. Publicly, though, Lennon is cautious. &quot;There is a lot of confidence in the team but we don&apos;t want to be overconfident,&quot; Lennon said. &quot;This is an Ajax team that was minutes away from beating Milan, so despite their current form not being what it should be they are still a very formidable team at home. &quot;There is a lot of confidence going into the game from a lot of people. Obviously I have to be very wary and I still make Ajax favourites but only because they are at home. &quot;I don&apos;t want to get carried away. I would snap your hand off for a point but we know this team is capable of winning \u2013 and we know this team is capable of losing. We have to strike a balance on how we approach this game.&quot; Ajax haven&apos;t had their recent troubles to seek, having slipped to sixth in their domestic league and won only once in five outings. &quot;We think we will succeed if we play the same as we did in Glasgow,&quot; said the Ajax manager, Frank De Boer.", "sentences": ["Neil Lennon believes Forster will be handed a first cap by Roy Hodgson in the upcoming matches against Chile and Germany, with the Football Association sending a scout to watch Forster in Amsterdam.", "I want it to be a long-term thing for five, six, seven years of him being England&apos;s No1 or No2.&quot; On the eve of Celtic&apos;s crucial Champions League match against Ajax in Amsterdam, Lennon was understandably reluctant to discuss Hodgson&apos;s relationship with Hart."], "title": "Neil Lennon says Celtic's Fraser Forster should be a fixture for England", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/05/neil-lennon-celtic-fraser-forster-england", "tags": ["Celtic", "Champions League", "Ajax", "Neil Lennon", "Football"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-06T16:25:45Z", "article": "GRAVITY HATES HIM, HE&apos;S DIVING AGAIN While much of the focus on Lord Ferg&apos;s new booky wook has been on the rows and the insults delivered with the precision of a bullet from Richard Harrow, what has been lost in all the frenzy is the former Manchester United manager&apos;s acute understanding of what makes people tick, whether they needed the carrot or the stick (Mark Bosnich needed a bit more of the former and plenty of the latter). But Ferg&apos;s successor at Manchester United, David Moyes, has a dilemma on his hands in the shape of Ashley Young, hide and seek world champion. If he gives him a verbal thrashing in a bid to get the least whelming United player of all time to stop diving, Young starts crying and then it&apos;s a meeting with HR for Moyes. No one wants a meeting with HR. But the other route is problematic too \u2013 every time he tries the arm round the shoulder, Young goes flying, turning 17 times in the air before landing in an entitled, crumpled heap. &quot;Penalty! Penalty! Ref!&quot; he wails. &quot;Penalty!&quot; Every bloody time. It&apos;s getting quite tiresome for poor old Moyes. &quot;But Ashley,&quot; he replies, &quot;this is just a meeting. In my office. There is no referee, I don&apos;t know what to... Ashley, where are you going?&quot; But Young isn&apos;t listening. He&apos;s left the room and he&apos;s weaving through the corridors at Carrington, occasionally feigning contact with a stray crisp packet or pretending to fall over the leg of a cleaner, before appealing for a foul, his eyes wide and his face a picture of innocence. An exasperated Moyes never bothers going after him because by now he knows that short of cutting off Young&apos;s legs and replacing them with a Mr Wobbly Man type sphere, there is no way to put an end to the nonsense. After all, Ferg thought he had succeeded - &quot;Ashley did it two weeks in a row but we stopped it&quot; - and it turns out he was wrong. See, Young was at it again during United&apos;s 0-0 draw with Real Sociedad in Big Cup, winning a penalty after being impeded by a rogue gust of air, weeks after being hauled over the coals for more slapstick gravity-based shenanigans against Crystal Palace. Yet although Moyes told him to cut out the diving after the Palace game, strangely he saw nothing wrong with the latest travesty. &quot;Ashley is a big fan of Mad Men,&quot; Moyes didn&apos;t say. &quot;This was just a tribute to the opening credits of the show, where a man we must assume is the fragile, fallible Don Draper is shown tumbling out of the window of his Manhattan office, the image a reminder of the ephemeral nature of advertising and, by definition, life. Ashley is deep like that.&quot; But others were not so generous in their assessment. &quot;He&apos;s obviously played for it,&quot; seethed Roy Keane on ITV, hot steam steaming out of his lugs. &quot;Ashley Young&apos;s obviously gone down too much over the last few months. If he scores the penalty, as a United player you would be delighted, but he&apos;s conned the referee there.&quot; And on Sky, the normally placid Uncle Fester went even further in his criticism. &quot;This [dive] is pathetic,&quot; he blasted. &quot;I just wish Ashley would cut this out because he&apos;s a good player but he&apos;s getting a bad name.&quot; It&apos;s a bit late for that and any efforts by Young to restore his reputation now would probably end up with him shattering it after falling over his own shadow.

A defeat for Milan in the Camp Nou keeps Neil Lennon&apos;s hopes of guiding Celtic to the last 16 once again alive but the Scottish champions were deservedly defeated here. Only time will tell how damaging Celtic&apos;s tame showing in the Netherlands will prove to be. Celtic must beat Milan in Glasgow and almost certainly take tangible reward from December&apos;s trip to Barcelona to claim second place in Group H. For either scenario to occur, Lennon&apos;s team must improve on the lack of both belief and talent in forward areas which allowed Ajax to defend their single goal lead without much hassle at all. &quot;I think some of the players will have regrets about the game because they were nowhere near their best,&quot; said Lennon. &quot;At this level, you can&apos;t have that.&quot; The strength of the pre-match atmosphere, boosted further by the closed ArenA roof, highlighted how significant a match this was for Ajax. Yet two meetings with Celtic, inside and outside of stadia in Glasgow and Amsterdam, have also served to highlight the moronic element which attaches itself to the Dutch champions. Before kick-off here, a large banner bearing the offensive slogan &quot;fenian bastards&quot; was produced behind one goal.

News reports claimed eight police officers needed hospital treatment and 15 fans were arrested after clashes in central Amsterdam before the game. &quot;The officers took quite a beating,&quot; said a police spokesman. &quot;One of the officers was unconscious, another had his nose broken.&quot; Ajax&apos;s play was more appealing. Fraser Forster, so prominent for Celtic in Europe in recent times, had to bat away a Stefano Denswil free-kick as the hosts sought the comfort of an early lead. Forster produced an even better save in the 17th minute to deny Siem de Jong&apos;s. Celtic had been guilty time and again of cheaply conceding possession, albeit Ajax&apos;s lack of punch in the final third offered hope to the visitors. Not that Celtic offered anything even resembling attacking menace themselves. Kris Commons and Georgios Samaras produced nothing at all by way of support to the lone striker Anthony Stokes. Still, within five minutes of the restart, Celtic passed up a glorious opportunity. Beram Kayal was inexplicably left to surge forward from midfield to within 20 yards of the Ajax goal. Kayal shot but failed to even hit the target. Just 60 seconds later, that profligacy was punished. Lasse Sch\u00f6ne worked a one-two with De Jong on the edge of the visitors&apos; penalty area. Forster came out to meet Sch\u00f6ne, who calmly slotted the ball through the goalkeeper&apos;s legs. Stokes could have provided an immediate reply. However, the Republic of Ireland international fired right into the hands of Jasper Cillessen after collecting a Commons pass. Commons almost caught Cillessen out with a long-range effort, 20 minutes from time. Lennon&apos;s first attacking change came three minutes later as Derk Boerrigter, a former Ajax winger, replaced Stokes. Samaras was thereby moved from the left flank to centre forward, where he is never entirely keen on playing. Any dispute from Samaras over his positional switch could readily have been offset by his blatant lack of impact on the game when in his favoured role. As Ajax looked to settle proceedings, Forster used his feet to block from the outstanding De Jong. From the resultant corner, Denswil headed against a post; in truth, a second goal never looked necessary.", "sentences": ["Celtic&apos;s best news of the night was delivered from Barcelona rather than Amsterdam.", "Yet two meetings with Celtic, inside and outside of stadia in Glasgow and Amsterdam, have also served to highlight the moronic element which attaches itself to the Dutch champions.", "News reports claimed eight police officers needed hospital treatment and 15 fans were arrested after clashes in central Amsterdam before the game."], "title": "Ajax 1-0 Celtic | Champions League Group H match report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/06/ajax-celtic-champions-league-match-report", "tags": ["Champions League", "Ajax", "Celtic", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-07T09:15:05Z", "article": "1) Arsenal&apos;s experience proves decisive  One of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s post-match comments, after the inspiring 1-0 away win over Borussia Dortmund, slipped largely under the radar. &quot;If we had a very young team tonight, you would be overrun and lose by a very high score,&quot; the Arsenal manager said. As it was, he had an experienced team, one reinforced by the key signings from recent summers. There was a time when Wenger offered the impression that he found experience overrated; that the polishing of young diamonds was what drove him. The summer of 2011 signalled a different emphasis, with Per Mertesacker and Mikel Arteta among those to come in while, the following year, there was Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud. All four played their part against Dortmund, in a starting team whose average age was 27. Mertesacker, in particular, was immense. The young guns live on, with the youngest, Aaron Ramsey, scoring the winning goal. But this was a seasoned performance from Arsenal, marked by defensive stability and sound decision-making. In some respects, it was the display that Wenger hoped for when he changed direction in the transfer market.

Yet there was also a timely reminder that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will not tolerate indiscipline in this team&apos;s brave new world. If five of the six changes the Portuguese made to his lineup from the defeat at Newcastle were influenced by events on Tyneside \u2013 Fernando Torres&apos;s was enforced \u2013 then Eden Hazard&apos;s omission actually owed more to poor time-keeping. The Belgian had returned to Lille on Sunday night as a guest of his former club, watching his ex team-mates win 2-0 to leapfrog their money-flushed visitors Monaco in Ligue 1. He had been due back on Monday morning for Chelsea&apos;s training session ahead of the Schalke game but only reappeared in Cobham at around lunchtime. Club and manager rather closed ranks on the subject on Wednesday night, Mourinho referring to the 22-year-old as &quot;a kid&quot; and that kids &quot;make mistakes&quot;. Yet it was the follow-up that was more intriguing. &quot;He was sad because he didn&apos;t play,&quot; he said, &quot;and we won without him.&quot; Given how ruthless the manager has been at any slight dip in form, demonstrated by David Luiz and Juan Mata to date this term, Hazard may have to display some patience in the days ahead. Others, notably Willian, have staked their claim for a place against West Bromwich Albion. In the short term, missing a Eurostar could well prove costly.

Before the game, the Barcelona coach Tata Martino had noted that Barcelona were in &quot;crisis&quot;. It was meant as an ironic dig at the famous entorno that surrounds the club \u2013 that swirl of pressure, politics and criticism, in which nothing is ever good enough. On the other side of Barcelona&apos;s 3-1 win, there was a glimpse of a real crisis. Up in Milan&apos;s directors&apos; box, Barbara Berlusconi and the director general for whose head she has called, Adriano Galliani, sat side by side but were a world apart. The greeting between the two was cold and Galliani sought solace in conversations with his Catalan hosts. On the pitch, there were glimpses from Kak\u00e1 and, when he came on, Mario Balotelli. But Robinho had little influence and the sense of decline, already building in previous years, was inescapable. At times, there was a melancholy to it; this game did not really capture imaginations as it should have done. The seven-times winners of this competition are unlikely to make an impact this season. Already 19 points behind leaders Roma in Italy, they may not even be back next year. Sid Lowe  \u2022 Match report: Barcelona 3-1 Milan  4) Missing Hooper As Gary Hooper struggles to make a positive impact at Norwich City, Celtic are enduring similar problems without their former centre-forward. Neil Lennon recruited Amido Balde and Teemu Pukki after Hooper&apos;s summer departure. Neither forward was deemed worthy of a start against Ajax while Anthony Stokes, who was in the XI, lacks the quality to score regularly at the top level. It may well have been more legitimate for Celtic to sign one striker of a higher standard for the combined outlay on Balde and Pukki. A failure to convert chances and over-reliance on certain players for goals has been apparent in Celtic&apos;s domestic displays. In the Champions League, that problem is merely magnified. It could fatally undermine their knockout hopes.

David Moyes&apos;s one notable summer signing looked short of confidence prior to collecting the first red card of his United career, with the \u00a327.5m midfielder&apos;s passing often cautious or careless and his tackling flirting with trouble between his first and second bookings of the night. At Everton, he flourished as the big hairy fish in a smaller pond. At United he has yet to show the same composure, authority or threat and where he fits into the champions&apos; line-up remains uncertain. Andy Hunter  \u2022 Match report: Real Sociedad 0-0 Manchester United   \u2022 Young expected to be warned again about diving by Moyes  6) Nasri has rediscovered his sparkle The sight of a Samir Nasri bewitching a clutch of CSKA Moscow players in their area during the opening half of Manchester City&apos;s 5-2 win was the latest proof of the Frenchman&apos;s resurgence. In tandem with David Silva, Nasri has recaptured the form that helped take City to the title two years ago, with the playmaker speaking before the game about how content he is with life again. So far, Nasri has outshone all of his stellar team-mates bar the ever brilliant Sergio Ag\u00fcero to make a case for being the club&apos;s best player. This follows last term when his disquiet was emblematic of the lost season at City which ended pot-less and with a disgruntled and disenchanted squad. The X-factor in all of this is Roberto Mancini. The Italian led the club to the FA Cup and a first championship in 44 years, so he departed a winner. But when it came to a decision between the manager or players, the owners made the correct choice by removing Mancini for Manuel Pellegrini. Nasri, alone, is evidence of that.

Serie A has been a pale shadow of itself for the best part of 15 years now, though there&apos;s still been three Italian victories in the Champions League since then. You wouldn&apos;t put too much money on Napoli or Milan reaching the business end of this year&apos;s tournament. You wouldn&apos;t put ludicrous amounts on Juve making it, either, though providing they negotiate their way out of the group past Copenhagen and Galatasaray, they&apos;re perhaps Italy&apos;s best bet to go deep in the knockout stage. They&apos;ve now gone toe to toe twice with Real Madrid, a team with genuine Champions League winning pretensions, and acquitted themselves admirably. The defence may not be quite up to classic Italian standards, but as attack-minded quintets go, Fernando Lllorente, Carlos Tevez, Claudio Marchisio, Arturo Vidal and the increasingly impressive Paul Pogba aren&apos;t half bad. Especially with Andrea Pirlo pulling the strings, and Fabio Quagliarella straining at the leash on the bench. An outside chance, especially if they get a friendly draw or two. And it&apos;s about time Italy bothered the roll of honour again. Scott Murray  \u2022 Match report: Juventus 2-2 Real Madrid  8) Wake-up call for &apos;average&apos; PSG Laurent Blanc&apos;s team lost their 100% record on Tuesday night but that was perhaps no bad thing. Group C has been a little too easy for the French team so far, and the setback against an average team will have made the players realise that they will have to perform better if they have the desire to go all the way this season. Average, indeed, was the word Blanc chose to describe his own team after the 1-1 draw. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say there was a lack of desire or investment. We were too average in all areas,&quot; he told RMC. &quot;We had a lot of technical errors, which hasn&apos;t happened for some time. Despite this, we still created a lot of opportunities, so we also showed some clumsiness in front of goal. It reminds us that before talking about a win or how many goals we will score, we have to win it on the pitch, and tonight, Paris were too average to win.&quot; The good news for Blanc was another goal from Zlatan Ibrahimovic, his 10th in Europe for the club a mere 15 months since moving there. Marcus Christenson  \u2022 Match report: Paris Saint-Germain 1-1 Anderlecht  9) Solbakken leaves ghost of Luton behind There cannot have been many Wolves fans who mourned the departure of Stale Solbakken when the Norwegian was sacked by the club 10 months ago after a run of three wins in 16 games and a shock FA Cup exit at the hands of non-league Luton Town. Yet on Tuesday night, that very man raised his hands to the skies and hugged his assistants as the final whistle at Parken confirmed that his FC Copenhagen had beaten Roberto Mancini&apos;s Galatasaray to move level with the Turkish club in second place in Group B. The main difference between Solbakken&apos;s Wolves side and his Copenhagen can probably best be summed up by the fact that the Danish side&apos;s players seem to believe in the manager&apos;s methods, whereas that did not always seem to be the case at Molineux. &quot;This was the best match I have seen this team play since I came back here as coach [in August],&quot; Solbakken told uefa.com after the match against Galatasaray. &quot;We did everything right throughout and stuck to our gameplan. In general I think we were in control and we won deservedly. Our entire team did extremely well.&quot; Next up? Juventus away. MC  \u2022 Match report: FC Copenhagen 1-0 Galatasaray  10) Hulk profligate against former club Hulk&apos;s \u20ac40m move to Zenit St Petersburg was quite the boost to Porto&apos;s coffers, yet they&apos;ve benefited even further since his transfer. The killer instinct that earned him such a wild price tag seems to have left him following his move to Russia and despite playing well on his Champions League return to Porto earlier this season, he still managed to miss a gilt-edged chance against his formed club in a tight 1-0 win. On Wednesday night, he was profligate again. Though he scored a 28th-minute equaliser, he also missed a second-half penalty that would have won Zenit the game and all but sealed his side&apos;s qualification to the knockout stages at Porto&apos;s expense. For Porto, it&apos;s the transfer that keeps on paying.

Ti\u00ebsto, Afrojack, Hardwell, Armin van Buuren \u2013 these DJs and producers are the backbone of the global EDM industry, commanding crowds of thousands by blending the twinkling trance they pioneered a decade ago with the thrilling asymmetry of dubstep. Away from this fluorescent kitsch, however, lurks an underground Dutch scene that is even stronger than ever, with as many as eight dance music festivals in a single weekend in Amsterdam. The one I visit is Dekmantel, held in a giant woodland clearing on the city&apos;s border, and there&apos;s a bold shaft of daylight between the music being played here (subtle shifts of mood, a strong narrative thread pumping through it) and Ti\u00ebsto&apos;s blandly utopian oeuvre of predictable builds and drops. Tom Trago&apos;s afternoon disco set is floozily fabulous, the Amsterdam native chucking on crowdpleasers such as Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King while wearing a child&apos;s party hat on his bald head. Less than eight hours previously he had been behind the decks of Trouw, a club at the heart of the scene (Amsterdam&apos;s mayor spun the first record at its recent reopening).     Tom Trago. Photograph: Merlijn Hoek    &quot;There&apos;s a tsunami of new people coming up,&quot; he says, dragging excitedly on a joint after he comes offstage. &quot;There&apos;s a positive development going on in young kids, and their consciousness about what is good or not. Kids are punky \u2013 at 17, 18, 19, they say no, I&apos;m not going to just do what this other guy is doing.&quot; His Voyage Direct series of releases champions this new generation, featuring local producers such as Awanto 3, Maxi Mill and Dexter who make melodic, probing house music. These, as well as his own tracks \u2013 including the ones on new album The Light Fantastic \u2013 show the tree-ring growth outward from the core of Chicago house and Detroit techno that arrived at Amsterdam clubs such as The Roxy in the early 90s. &quot;Back then, it was much more like a typical harbour,&quot; says another local producer, San Proper, leisurely accepting the joint from Trago. &quot;People had the information, but they didn&apos;t really own it.&quot; In other words, they aped the imports of the American and UK scenes, with labels such as Bunker and Outland driving the first wave of Dutch underground dance. &quot;Maybe the 909s were really cheap,&quot; wonders Trago as to its popularity. &quot;The ecstasy was good too. But that was all before we were born, of course!&quot; he laughs.      The arrival of Rush Hour, a label, shop and party promoter team, cohered the scene further. &quot;House, Detroit techno, disco \u2013 we really got into that as a result of Rush Hour,&quot; says Thomas Martojo, one of the three founders of Dekmantel, which has grown from club nights for 100 friends to festivals for thousands, plus a record label of their own. &quot;Rush Hour has a massive influence on the people who are buying records.&quot; It was also important for Juju and Jordash, the Israeli duo Gal Aner and Jordan Czamanski, who make jazz-inflected techno and moved to Amsterdam seven years ago. &quot;It definitely played a role,&quot; says Czamanski. &quot;All the parties when we moved here were Rush Hour stuff.&quot; The city seemed impossibly fertile for the pair, coming from techno-starved Tel Aviv and Haifa where, as Aner drily notes in a nod to his partner, &quot;Jordan was the scene.&quot;     The Dekmantel soundsystem. Photograph: Merlijn Hoek    &quot;Amsterdam is the complete opposite of Tel Aviv \u2013 life doesn&apos;t necessarily mean struggle here,&quot; continues Czamanski. &quot;Tel Aviv is a happening city, but politically it&apos;s very tense and stressful. There were one or two clubs that brought DJs we were into, and that was every few months, unless it was cancelled because there was a bomb on a bus. And then moving to a place like Amsterdam where every week there was something different going on, it influenced our music.&quot; The difference between now and the past is that, as San Proper says, &quot;there&apos;s an identity to it now \u2013 people are claiming something. People are saying there is a Dutch sound. Me, I can&apos;t distinguish it at all.&quot; &quot;There is no Dutch sound!&quot; Trago explodes in agreement. &quot;There&apos;s too much shit going on to give one identity to it.&quot; And this, paradoxically, is what defines the scene: a plurality between genres that London has been slouching towards, but which techno-centric Berlin absolutely rejects. &quot;In London you can be doing dubstep nights, year long, every weekend, but here there&apos;s just one dubstep night and it probably plays some hip-hop too. Everything falls into each other,&quot; says Trago, with Martojo agreeing: &quot;You&apos;re not a techno guy or a disco guy or a drum&apos;n&apos;bass guy \u2013 everyone visits everyone else&apos;s parties.&quot;     Legowelt and Xosar at Dekmantel. Photograph: Merlijn Hoek    Their working methods are varied too \u2013 whereas Trago primarily uses one piece of equipment, the Akai MPC2000XL sampler and drum machine (&quot;the Japanese guy who invented this shit, I want to be at his funeral \u2013 this machine changed my life&quot;), Juju and Jordash use analogue synths and jam for 40 minutes at a time to generate a single idea. When performing live, they frequently improvise. Falling between the two are Legowelt and Xosar, lovers and collaborators who each work on their own cosmic takes on house. Where Xosar (US expat Sheela Rahman) mostly uses Korg&apos;s Electribe unit to make tracks, Legowelt (The Hague resident Danny Wolfers) has a love affair with vintage synths that has got massively out of hand. &quot;It&apos;s disgusting, it&apos;s perverse \u2013 he&apos;s addicted to synthesisers like a crackhead,&quot; says Rahman. &quot;They&apos;re oozing out of closets \u2013 any drawer you open up you find drum machines.&quot; &quot;The kitchen and the bathroom, those are the only rooms that don&apos;t have synthesisers in,&quot; Wolfers admits. &quot;In our house we can make music anywhere we want \u2013 I can attach a synthesiser in the garden.&quot; Their tracks are transcendent pilgrimages through electronic sound, &quot;trying to subliminally relay the message of our intention to help humanity raise its consciousness levels,&quot; as Rahman says. &quot;For advancement of the human population, [to remind them] to not be pedestrian,&quot; continues Wolfers. &quot;And to just be freaky.&quot; For them, too, this is a scene that is absolutely not nationalistic, thanks to the global village online. &quot;It&apos;s cyberpunk, information overload, but we can pick the good things out of it,&quot; says Wolfers of the new dance pluralism. &quot;In the 90s in The Hague you had the scene around [producer and DJ] I-F: raw electro and raw acid that went into techno, and it was very, very local. Even Utrecht had their own house scene. But nowadays it&apos;s international.&quot; Rahman chimes in: &quot;When I was living in Los Angeles, it was more to do with a scene as opposed to the actual music, that jugular feeling of energy and power. But there&apos;s a lot more emphasis placed on those feelings here.&quot; Looking out on the crowd at Dekmantel, identical in ponchos and cutting shapes through the dry ice and rain, you can see what she means.

But in Simon McBurney&apos;s new staging of The Magic Flute for English National Opera, Mozart&apos;s enigmatic show-cum-pantomime takes on a yet more sinister hue. With McBurney, nothing is as you expect. Amid the darkness in this rich, inventive production there were, too, moments of startling humour and theatrical wizardry. The effect is absorbing and finally captivating, rather than slick, fast and empty. His name is synonymous with Complicite, the theatre company he founded in 1983, which is a collaborator in this co-production with Aix-en-Provence and with Amsterdam, where it was seen last year. Physicality, adventure, experiment and surprise are key to the Complicite experience. All were in full evidence at Thursday&apos;s opening night, conducted by Gergely Madaras making his ENO debut, his players raised up from the pit to be more engaged with the action, as they would have been in 1791, the year Mozart wrote the opera, completing it weeks before his death. Whether you fall for the staging or not \u2013 many will still harbour desires for Nicholas Hytner&apos;s classic production, which made more &quot;for the last time&quot; returns than Frank Sinatra \u2013 the singing is mostly outstanding. A strong cast was led by Ben Johnson, lyrical as the yearning Tamino, Roland Wood, engaging if low key as a lost-traveller-with-knapsack Papageno, and Devon Guthrie, touching and true as Pamina.     \u2018Touching and true\u2019: Devon Guthrie as Pamina with Roland Wood as Papageno. Photograph:  Tristram Kenton    A confessed opera sceptic for much of his life, McBurney nonetheless has music in his bones, as this production showed. His direction of the orchestral flautist (Katie Bedford), who stepped on stage to play Tamino&apos;s magic flute music, and of the celeste player (Soojeong Joo) was inspired. They engaged variously with the action as the work progressed and helped bring alive the sense of all-round entertainment that Mozart and his librettist, the impresario-actor Emanuel Schikaneder, who also played Papageno, so clearly wanted. Whereas some directors play down the arcane mysteries of this work, robbing it of its sinew yet making it easier for modern audiences, McBurney embraces them all. Numerical cryptograms, masonic symbolism are all part of Mozart&apos;s strange game, as Marcus du Sautoy explains in a dense essay in the programme entitled &quot;Mozart and Maths&quot;, accompanied by the obligatory pentagram and the schematics of the golden ratio. In this escape from naturalism into abstraction, McBurney is helped by Michael Levine&apos;s robustly intellectual and handsome set designs and Jean Kalman&apos;s lighting: the three doors of Wisdom, Truth and Reason are part of a massive library, presumably Sarastro&apos;s, of leatherbound books, but most of the stage images suggest life&apos;s underlying geometry. Past and present, the old regime represented by the Queen of the Night (Cornelia G\u00f6tz) and her gang, and the brave new world of Sarastro \u2013 here, a Prospero-type figure \u2013 and his creepy acolytes in grey suits, are ever in conflict. They discuss the future of the lovers Tamino and Pamina around a vast boardroom table, the sleek HQ of an unnamed and chilling cult. James Creswell, in black Nehru coat and horn-rimmed specs, was masterly in the ambiguous role of Sarastro: his dubious theft of Pamina from her mother (the Queen of the Night) in the name of beauty and wisdom has always struck me as more morally questionable than most productions allow. McBurney brought out the uncertainty without hammering it home, since the music at that point is joyous and clear. Top praise for the chorus, trained by Martin\u00a0Fitzpatrick.     The fine trio of Clare Presland, Rosie Aldridge and Eleanor Dennis behind Ben Johnson's Tamino with his magic flute. Photograph:  Tristram Kenton    The three boys, superbly performed by Alessio d&apos;Andrea, Finlay A&apos;Court and Alex Karlsson, might be old men or emaciated children. The three ladies (the fine trio of Eleanor Dennis, Clare Presland and Rosie Aldridge) first enter in what appear to be army fatigues but soon switch to more voluptuous garb and more sexually predatory behaviour. Monostatos, he of the greasy-hair and lust, was cast as an old-style East End gangland thug, excellently performed though less well sung by Brian Galliford. Important elements in the staging include the busy employment of an onstage foley artist, particularly for the trials by cataclysmic fire and a deluge of water, but also an entire forest of chirruping birds for Papageno the bird-catcher. The simple mechanics of actors flapping sheet music to suggest birds in flight was one of the evening&apos;s most indelible image. Yet video and projection are used cleverly too, from the opening, when a gargantuan snake leaps forward and words are drawn on a chalkboard, appearing and erased in front of our eyes. The orchestra was on top form, though Madaras&apos;s freedom with tempi \u2013 great slowings up, particularly \u2013 was at times distracting. There is so much to intrigue and delight here, yet this is not a Magic Flute for those seeking reassurance. Towards the end, having united stage and pit, McBurney extends the action into the auditorium, turning the camera on the audience, who can see each other on stage as Papageno and the lovely Papagena of Mary Bevan thread their way through the front stalls. We chuckle at\u00a0this clever twist. Darkness is indeed\u00a0eventually cast out by the light of the rising sun. Yet you know the brightness may be short lived: a small light but a big tunnel.", "sentences": ["His name is synonymous with Complicite, the theatre company he founded in 1983, which is a collaborator in this co-production with Aix-en-Provence and with Amsterdam, where it was seen last year."], "title": "The Magic Flute \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/10/magic-flute-simon-mcburney-eno-review", "tags": ["Opera", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "Simon McBurney", "English National Opera (ENO)"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-11T10:55:00Z", "article": "    Reading on mobile?

US hip-hop star Eminem, 41, whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, triumphed with the prizes for global icon and best hip-hop act on the same day he scored his seventh consecutive No 1 UK album with The Marshall Mathers LP 2. He took to the stage to perform Berzerk and Rap God \u2013 two tracks from his new album. &quot;This is crazy.

Making a reference to the 2004 comedy, he joked: &quot;I love award.&quot; Cyrus, 20, alluded to her drug-taking past by taking what looked like a joint from her handbag as she accepted the award for best video for her song Wrecking Ball. &quot;I couldn&apos;t fit this award in my purse but I did find this,&quot; she said before flicking a lighter and smoking it. The Bangerz singer, who opened the show with a performance of We Can&apos;t Stop, previously courted controversy with her &quot;twerking&quot; with Robin Thicke at the MTV VMAs in August.

We are all just little blobs on the great big wheel of fortune and sometimes things come to an end and there&apos;s not a damn thing you can do about it. Not that the pop group Keane have officially split up, you understand \u2013 I might not be able to write about it if they had, the feelings run too deep \u2013 but they&apos;re releasing a greatest hits album, and then taking a &quot;break&quot;, and frontman Tom is rumoured to be writing a solo record. Like frontmen do when their bands split up. Hmmm. This week they bowed out, at least for now, with a very intimate gig in Berlin, attended by a small clutch of fans from around the world, and viewed by those who missed it in more than a thousand cinemas in a live broadcast. It certainly feels like a good time for a swansong: Lily Allen is singing a cover of Somewhere Only We Know on the John Lewis Christmas advert with the animated bear and Keane&apos;s Greatest Hits album is released today. The Berlin gig venue, Goya, turned out to be a place where Germans hold something called &quot;over 30s parties&quot; the rest of the time. Which was apt, as over 30 we all were \u2013 and partying, from the opening song Bend and Break to the minute they left the stage an hour or so later, looking like they might cry. When you&apos;re a rock critic, or a writer for style mags, both of which I have been, it can be hard to explain to your colleagues why you love Keane so much. People expect you to champion something a bit more bleeding-edge. There was a moment during their Berlin show when I thought about this; about how quickly every Keane song grabs me, how the uplifting bit is always uplifting. Like a fast-acting drug \u2013 it just works. I thought about the years of noodling Brooklyn bands and avant-garde Montreal noisemakers I have stood through, and how not one of them has a song that makes me want to lay down my weapons like Crystal Ball does when a room full of people are singing along to it. How I spent years reviewing &quot;cool&quot; bands where it takes half an hour to get to the bit where you find out there isn&apos;t actually going to be a chorus, and that where there could be a middle eight, there is instead a muezzin&apos;s call ironically reinterpreted by a cheese grater. (What a relief to just say, I&apos;m not actually enjoying this. I just want to listen to Perfect Symmetry, or Bedshaped, or Spiralling.) How, when you go on tour with Keane, they are pretty droll about what the critics say, while well aware, in their understated way, that they are having the last laugh. How Jesse Quin, their touring bassist, will sit and Photoshop pictures of planets over the lead singer Tom Chaplin&apos;s face in the press shots. &quot;Ah, old moonface again,&quot; says Chaplin, who gets up at half five in the morning to go running. How they have sold more than 11m albums over 15 years, and still have the same manager who saw them playing to three people and a barmaid and thought they might just be on to something. How the novelists Bret Easton Ellis, Irvine Welsh and William Boyd are all devoted to them. How Rich Hughes, the drummer, got involved with Amnesty International and the campaign to save Troy Davis, and is still working with the family that Davis left behind after he was put to death.       Reading on mobile? Watch here How one night, when I had joined them on tour in Brazil, they agreed that I could have unprecedented access, and so took me out drinking caipirinhas in some awful bar that played Beatles covers, and then took me back to Tim Rice-Oxley&apos;s room where they played the guitar all night. What songs did they sing? What late-night confessionals did they tell? I can&apos;t tell you, as being the consummate professional journalist that I am, I passed out on the bed, snoring. (This is where I should have known better than to feel safe in a foreign bedroom with wealthy, famous men, fresh from the stage, high on spirits and a long way from their girlfriends back home. Yes, they did what only rockstars unleashed like a pack of wolves can do in these circumstances \u2013 they leant over my sleeping body and tied my shoelaces together. When I eventually stood up, I fell straight over again.) How I thought of that when I read Morrissey&apos;s memoirs and found Keane making a surprise appearance on page 376, when the man says how &quot;astonishing&quot; it was when their debut album, Hopes and Fears, kept his Quarry off the number one spot, and they wrote to him to apologise. (What he doesn&apos;t mention is that he replied saying he forgave them.) How Noel Gallagher was once asked for his thoughts on Keane, a band comprising a singer, keyboardist and a drummer, and he replied, &quot;Traditionally speaking, the three biggest twats in any band are the singer, the keyboardist and the drummer. I don&apos;t need to say anything else.&quot; I mentioned this to Hughes after their show in Berlin. &quot;If we&apos;ve made it into Noel Gallagher&apos;s top 50 quotes,&quot; he said, dreamily\u2026 he loves that man. I have seen Keane play in Oslo, Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro, Hollywood, Palm Springs, and even a lovely show in the De La Warre pavilion in Bexhill on Sea, East Sussex, to which I took my baby daughter in a pram. (Indeed, I must thank the band for the lullaby quality of their music, as she fell asleep as they played their first song and didn&apos;t wake up till morning. A first.) At that same gig, I was chatting to a security guard, saying how nice it must be for the band to play a homecoming show like this. &quot;Oh no, they&apos;re not from round here,&quot; said the man. Really? But I thought they were locals? &quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;they&apos;re from Battle. That&apos;s eight miles away.&quot; Oh Keane. I love you so.

The Labour party is using an opposition day debate in the House of Commons to force through a vote on the &quot;spare room subsidy&quot;. But Iain Duncan Smith will miss the debate. Inside Housing reports that charities and sector figures have called on MPs to scrap the &quot;unworkable and unfair&quot; policy. Andrew Sparrow will be following the debate on the Politics live bog. The Mirror lists 25 reasons why MPs should vote against the bedroom tax, and writing for Comment is free, Frances Ryan says the policy reveals a government willing to leave poor and vulnerable people out in the cold. She writes:  The bedroom tax has made one thing clear, at least. It has told us, in no uncertain terms, who matters to this government and who can be sacrificed. It&apos;s shown us it&apos;s willing to make life harder for people coping with long-term sickness or disability. It&apos;s shown us it&apos;s quite content to see people in poverty and push them further past the edge. There&apos;s something particularly telling about a policy that pushes people out of their homes. No wonder its architects didn&apos;t want it termed a tax on the bedroom: the most personal and intimate of things, a space we should all feel safe in.There are many people in this country who haven&apos;t felt safe for a long time. We can hope Tuesday&apos;s vote is the beginning of a change for them.The bedroom tax has long needed to be put out of its misery \u2013 so that hundreds of thousands of this country&apos;s most vulnerable people can finally be put out of theirs.  \u2022 A new report from the All Party Parliamentary Group for Looked After Children and Care Leavers, which finds that children in care do not get the support they have a legal right to. The entitlements inquiry, run by charity the Who Cares? Trust, heard from more than 1,000 children in care, care leavers, and professionals. It found that more than 70% of children in care and 80% of young care leavers do not think they have all the information they need about the support they should receive from their local authority; fewer than half of care leavers know they&apos;re entitled to help with the costs of getting and keeping a job, and only one third are receiving the \u00a32,000 setting up home allowance. The APPG chair, Craig Whittaker, said:  Not enough children in care are being told about their legal entitlements, and the support they do receive is not consistent enough. At the same time, we found that professionals who work with looked after children often feel they don&apos;t know everything they need to in order to support them fully.We&apos;ve put the voice of children and young care leavers at the heart of our report and, sadly, their experiences show that too often they are getting a raw deal. The ten recommendations we&apos;ve developed with young people will help to kick start the changes they want to see.We want a care system where every child and young person knows about, and receives without delay, the full range of support they are legally entitled to.  \u2022 This wonderful short film by MadeGood.films about the repair shops of Hackney in east London.

As a resident of the Netherlands&apos; capital, such stoned celeb dispatches \u2013 think Lady Gaga inhaling on stage in September 2012 at the same arena, Rihanna tweeting pictures of herself apparently enjoying biftas the size of the Hubble Space Telescope, and Chris Brown following suit \u2013 are a personal b\u00eate noir. Lately it seems that anyone with a tour to promote who comes within spitting distance of Schiphol airport is encouraged by their PR manager to make directly for the nearest cafe and tweet endless grainy, half-lit images of themselves toking from a massive blunt preferably modelling a loose-knit hat inspired by the Jamaican flag and proclaiming: &quot;Amsterdam is da best lolz #yolo&quot;. It must stop immediately. And this is why. First of all, it&apos;s as nakedly attention-seeking as a Kardashian belfie, both for the celebs and for the coffee shops who \u2013 forbidden from promoting themselves through the traditional channels \u2013 indulge them with herbal freebies galore. Which, frankly, is mutually parasitic and deeply unfair on the rest of us. What&apos;s more, if you are accepting an award at the MTV awards, you are essentially at work and should behave accordingly. And believe me, there&apos;s nothing more tedious than a stoned colleague. When I edited Time Out Amsterdam magazine, reliable coffee shop reviewers were extremely hard to find. As Cher Horowitz, protagonist of the film Clueless, and my personal go-to in matters of taste and decency, puts it while initiating her younger charge into the social mores of Beverly Hills: &quot;It is one thing to spark up a doobie and get laced at parties. It is quite another to be fried all day&quot;. If I&apos;ve paid 60-plus quid plus car rental to see Rihanna gyrate her way down a moving walkway in Arnhem, I&apos;d rather she showed up in a timely manner, and didn&apos;t give the impression she was pie-eyed throughout her rendition of Diamonds. I am no clean-living prude. Weed-dispensing coffee shops in Amsterdam \u2013 like off-licences in the UK and meth labs in Albuquerque \u2013 can be pillars of the community. Many a time have I kicked back in my friendly neighbourhood drug den after a punishing day at the word processor. I hate to say it, but spending lost hours holed up in a red-light district flophouse \u2013 and broadcasting one&apos;s presence there \u2013 is the surest way to mark oneself out as a daft tourist, blind to the myriad cultural treasures that Amsterdam has to offer, which includes everything from the recently reopened Rijksmuseum to a gallery devoted to the artistic veneration of cats. The latest generation of celebrities seem to have ignored the memo that the occasional cheeky spliff is a fun end-of-day indulgence, whereas spending large portions of the day out of your tree is the equivalent of standing in the middle of a cycle lane, damp map flapping in the drizzle, whilst belching out a request for directions to the Hard Rock Cafe. We all need a release, and there is doubtless a valid case to be made for ending the futile worldwide war on drugs and the myriad benefits of decriminalisation. But Amsterdam doesn&apos;t necessarily have all of the answers. Over-the-counter sales to customers are &quot;tolerated&quot;, whereas the wholesale supply to the coffee shops is almost completely unregulated. Dutch law perpetuates the dumb fantasy that vast supplies of ganja miraculously arrive in the storeroom overnight \u2013 meaning mom-and-pop coffee shop owners have to consort with big-time criminals in order to keep going.

Watkins is not the only one to make the case for collaboration. World Bank president Jim Yong Kim was quoted as saying: &quot;To deliver bold solutions on climate change, we need to listen to and engage broader and more diverse audiences.&quot; And writing for the Network, artist and director of Cape Farewell, David Buckland, suggested that artists and scientists should be working together to change attitudes towards global warming.

How do you get the science, politics, humanitarian, development, environment, business and donor communities all singing from the same hymn sheet and working towards the same goals? Who gets to decide what those goals are? In addition, how do you communicate the value of working in coalition? It seems that the difficulty in arriving at suitable answers is perhaps the first challenge for coalition building. So can lessons be learned from other global issues?

And it is for this reason that the announcement of the Impac Dublin International Literary Award longlist is a gift for readers in search of unexpected delights. First things first: the Impac longlist is not like other longlists; it is not a handful of carefully selected books that will be further winnowed to achieve the shortlist. Rather, it is a full list of the books competing for next year&apos;s prize: every single title nominated by 110 participating libraries across the world. Each library can select up to three titles published in English (including translations), but many end up nominating the same novel \u2013 Hilary Mantel&apos;s Bring Up the Bodies and Richard Ford&apos;s Canada received nine nominations each \u2013 and so the list consists of a formidable 152 titles rather than a truly gargantuan 300. It is this lack of pre-selection \u2013 no limit on publishers&apos; entries, no pre-selection of titles \u2013 that makes the Impac longlist so interesting and varied, if not slightly idiosyncratic. Nobel, Booker and Pulitzer Prize-winners (Herta M\u00fcller, Peter Carey, Pat Barker) sit alongside determinedly commercial novels (Gillian Flynn&apos;s Gone Girl, Ian Rankin&apos;s Standing in Another Man&apos;s Grave). Giant New York Times bestsellers (JK Rowling, Richard Ford) jostle for the judges&apos; attention with writers published by small independent presses in Ethiopia or Bosnia (Tariku Abas Etenesh, Selvedin Avdi\u0107). Libraries are free to nominate whatever novel they wish, as long as they consider their choice representative of &quot;excellence&quot;, but it is clear from the list that libraries interpret this differently, which results in its unpredictability and democracy. For me, the real attraction of the huge scale of the Impac longlist is the inclusion of translated works, which creates a feeling that literature is universal, and that readers all over the world are somehow participating in a joint exercise of discovering what people are reading elsewhere. Over the past two years, I&apos;ve been devoting much time and energy to the art of translating fiction, and have been struck by just how much readers in English are missing out because of the lack of commercial support for titles in translation \u2013 so the inclusion of 41 novels drawn from 17 languages on the Impac list is a way of opening a window to the vast wealth of non-Anglophone literature. So far, seven translated titles have won the Impac Dublin award, so these novels are not on the list for mere decoration. The award has a reputation for producing quirky, if not downright obscure, winners. That may be to do with the fact that some winning authors have been little known to English-speaking readers \u2013 Michel Houellebecq, Javier Marias, Tahar Ben Jelloun and Per Pettersen were already well-established in their own countries and indeed elsewhere, but winning the Impac certainly boosted their reputations. However, the last three winners have been Anglophone (City of Bohane by Kevin Barry, Even the Dogs by Jon McGregor, Let the Great World Spin by Colum McCann), and it&apos;s also true that reading books from so many different literary cultures and genres helps the reader think about fiction in different, less rigid ways \u2013 this too might explain the unconventional results. Reading a Nobel Prize winner followed by a Scandinavian crime novel is not something most readers will be in the habit of doing, but I&apos;m looking forward to the experience.

"article": "1) Republic of Ireland (1958) Here&apos;s some typical Football Association forward planning for you. Had the 1957 FA Cup final between Aston Villa and Manchester United ended in a draw, the replay would have been held five days later at Goodison Park. All good and well, except that England were slated to play the Republic of Ireland at Wembley in the qualifiers for the World Cup a day before that. Villa captain Pat Saward, plus Roger Byrne, Duncan Edwards, Tommy Taylor and Liam Whelan of United, all potentially faced two momentous matches in 24 hours at the end of a gruelling season. Did anyone actually think about that? They didn&apos;t bother thinking about it, did they. No matter, Villa won 2-1, no double for United but trebles all round at Lancaster Gate. On to Wednesday evening, then, the first-ever World Cup qualifying match at Wembley, England&apos;s route to the 1950 and 1954 finals having technically been British Home Championship games. The hosts were the hot favourites, and so it proved, England running out easy 5-1 winners. Ireland goalkeeper Alan Kelly was good enough to later turn out at Wembley for Preston in the 1964 FA Cup final, but here, on his 20th birthday and an inexperienced Drumcondra player, he had a nightmare. Taylor was his chief tormentor, although Kelly couldn&apos;t remember the United star&apos;s hat-trick goal. &quot;I came to collect a corner kick by Tom Finney,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I got both hands on the ball and the next thing I remember was sitting in the back of the net being helped up by Noel Cantwell. All the white shirts were streaming back towards the halfway line, so I thought I would ask the obvious question. &apos;Was it a goal?&apos; I asked Cantwell. &apos;Yes son, and next time you come for a cross, get your knees up.&apos;&quot; The only plus point for the Irish, other than their consolation goal from Bristol City&apos;s Dermot Curtis, was that they had at long last been given a set of official tracksuits by the FAI. (Roy Keane&apos;s complaints are nothing new.) There was also a little scrap of schadenfreude to be savoured, for even if England now had one foot in the finals, they were not considered good enough to win the tournament. &quot;It is doubtful whether the present team, assuming that it gets so far, will get much more out of a trip to Sweden than a pleasant flight and a summer outing,&quot; wrote Donny Davies in this paper (one particular phrase sending a chill through the blood in retrospect). &quot;They are not likely to meet many European or South American teams with such inadequate performers in goal and at centre-half.&quot; But there was still hope for the Irish. Given they had already beaten the third team in the group, Denmark, at home, and were expected to do a similar job away, any victory against England in the return fixture at Dalymount Park 11 days later was likely to force a playoff, goal difference counting for nix at the time. Ireland made two significant changes, Tommy Godwin of Bournemouth taking over in goal \u2013 he had been the man between the sticks when Ireland famously became the first foreign team to defeat England on home soil in 1949 \u2013 while 21-year-old Millwall prospect Charlie Hurley made his debut at the back. Godwin made several stunning saves, most notably from Bristol City&apos;s Peter Ateyo, David Pegg and Taylor, while Hurley was a revelation, keeping Taylor otherwise quiet for the entire game. Up the other end, England were being bossed. Sheffield United&apos;s Alf Ringstead put Ireland ahead on three minutes with a low shot through a crowded box. Fellow dashing Blade Alan Hodgkinson twice dived at full length to turn away volleys by Middlesbrough&apos;s Arthur Fitzsimons. Joe Haverty of Arsenal missed a sitter. Whelan one-two&apos;d with Ringstead but fluffed his lines. Ireland made it into injury time, but Tom Finney blazed past Saward down the right and centred for Ateyo, who headed home to plunge Dublin into silence. Listen to the RTE audio: you can almost hear commentator Philip Greene&apos;s heart drop on to the floor with a dull thump. Has inner despair ever been more clearly captured in amber? England had made it at Ireland&apos;s expense, though as the Manchester Guardian&apos;s Davies noted, &quot;her players put up a sorry performance. England was not merely outplayed, she was outclassed, and no one realises this more clearly or lugubriously than the gentlemen who have the responsibility of producing a team to compete in Sweden.&quot; England were fated to perform badly at the finals, though some fates pale into insignificance when compared with others. Five of the players on the pitch that day, plus the Guardian&apos;s man, would not live to see the following year&apos;s World Cup. 2) Italy (1958) The Italian national team had a hard time of it for quite a while after the war. The 1948 Superga crash, which wiped out Torino, effectively did for the Azzurri too. A depleted team made their way to Brazil for the 1950 World Cup, but only by boat, understandably fearful of air travel. Knackered and unfit coming off the ship, they almost immediately got themselves knocked out. They travelled home by plane. The 1954 tournament in Switzerland ended abruptly with a 4-1 trouncing at the hands of the hosts. Chile in 1962 was all about the shame of Santiago, though that was nothing on the humiliation North Korea heaped on them in 1966. After which the team won Euro 68 and made it to the final of the 1970 World Cup. All better, then, but by lord those two decades were quite the haul. Despite that 20-year nadir, Italy only failed to qualify for the World Cup once. (They&apos;ve made it to all the others with the exception of the very first one in 1930, a jamboree they didn&apos;t bother to attend, in a fit of pique at being looked over for hosting duties in favour of Uruguay.) The sole blemish on their qualification record came in the 1958 series when their side \u2013 containing Uruguay&apos;s 1950 stars Juan Alberto Schiaffino and Alcides Ghiggia \u2013 were bundled out of the competition by a formidable Northern Ireland team not short of a few decently sized names itself in Danny Blanchflower, Harry Gregg and Peter McParland. The manner of Italy&apos;s exit was nothing short of farcical. The teams were due to play the decisive qualifier at Windsor Park in early December 1957. A victory for the Irish would send them through; Italy needed a draw to put them in a position where a home win in their final game over a dismal Portugal would fire them to the finals in Sweden instead. But referee Istvan Zsolt had been held up en route from Hungary to Belfast by fog in London, and only a local official could be found to replace him. Five minutes before kick-off, it was announced that the game would only be a friendly, causing much bristling in the crowd who, according to the Guardian, seemed &quot;unlikely to forget what they considered to be the intractability of the Italians over match arrangements and left no doubt that they felt they should have agreed to a British referee&quot;. Aye, right you are. And in fairness, the Italians had a point. Their keeper Ottavio Bugatti was knocked from pillar to post by the likes of McParland, who had form for this sort of nonsense, as those who recall the last FA Cup final would testify. In the final minute of a 2-2 draw, Guiseppe Chiapella leapt at McParland after one charge too many, and was sent off. Not that the Italians had been saints themselves, mind, Chiapella, Schiaffino and Rino Ferrario all taking turns to throw hands in the determined style. At the final whistle, thousands of spectators flooded the field of play with a view to raising Cain. Ferrario was sent crashing to the floor and had to be carted back to the dressing room unconscious. As it transpired, that result would have been enough for the Italians, who went on to beat Portugal 3-0 before Christmas. But decisions are decisions, and they were forced to go again. In the New Year, the replayed qualifier in Belfast was played, and the Irish stormed into a two-goal lead by half-time, Jimmy McIlroy and Wilbur Cush with the goals. Dino Da Costa bundled one back for Italy shortly after the break, but the ghig was up for Italy when Ghiggia, of all folk, was sent off with 25 minutes to go for a physical disagreement with Alf McMichael. Ireland were through, Italy were out, and what an end to a World Cup career for poor Ghiggia, the man who scored the most dramatic and far-reaching goal the tournament has ever seen. 3) Argentina (1970) Around the time of the qualifiers for the 1970 World Cup, Argentinian football was suffering from something of an image problem. Antonio Rattin&apos;s debating forum at Wembley. Racing Club hoofing Celtic all over the park. Estudiantes slicing Bobby Charlton&apos;s leg into red ribbons. The national team manager, Humberto Maschio, was best known internationally for his antics as a player at the 1962 World Cup when, playing as a naturalised Italian, he ran about the pitch throwing haymakers willy-nilly during the infamous Battle of Santiago against Chile. On the final whistle that day, he offered opponent Honorindo Landa his hand in friendship. When the two were shaking, Maschio took the opportunity to clatter Landa&apos;s jaw with his free southpaw. Honor indeed. Maschio was sacked just before the qualifiers, although much good it did the team&apos;s mood or reputation. They were battered 3-1 in Bolivia in their first game, and competed so roughly that the Argentinian dictator General Ongania was forced to order the squad to simmer down. (Ongania would later throw the entire Estudiantes team in the clink for acting up during an Intercontinental Cup brouhaha against Milan.) While the team&apos;s behaviour improved, their overall play did not, and Argentina lost their next match 1-0 in Peru. After a restorative one-goal win at home over Bolivia, the stage was set for a showdown against Peru at Boca Juniors&apos; Bombonera stadium. A win would salvage the campaign, forcing a playoff with the Peruvians. Problem was, Peru were a team on the up \u2013 Teofilo Cubillas was only 20 but already very much the real deal \u2013 while Argentina were heading in the other direction, sorely missing several stars of the great 1966 team in Oscar Mas, Luis Artime and everyone&apos;s favourite midfield-didact Rattin. Thanks to some inspired goalkeeping from Luis Rubinos, Peru held out until half-time, after which they decided to fly at their hosts. Oswaldo &apos;Cachito&apos; Ramirez zipped down the inside-left channel and whipped Peru&apos;s opening goal into the bottom right on 52 minutes. Rafael Joes Albrecht equalised with an Aldridgesque stuttering penalty on 78, but the die was cast only three minutes later, as Ramirez drifted from the left wing to the right-hand edge of the D before drawing Agustin Cejas in the Argentinian goal and disdainfully flicking into the left-hand side of the net. A glorious goal. Alberto Rendo&apos;s late equaliser set up a tense finale, but though Argentina were inexplicably given seven minutes of injury-time \u2013 virtually unheard of in those days \u2013 they couldn&apos;t find a way through. Peru were off to Mexico, while the humiliated giants of Argentina could have been forgiven for thinking that they were paying back some sort of antics-assessed karmic debt. 4) Belgium (1974) Plenty had been expected of Belgium at the 1970 World Cup. A fast and skilful team \u2013 their star men the Anderlecht trio of Paul Van Himst, Johan Devrindt and Wilfried Puis \u2013 had done for Spain and Yugoslavia in qualifying. And though they started the tournament with odds of 33-1, their opponents were paying no heed to the bookies. &quot;The ball is round and everyone has the same chance,&quot; said group rival USSR coach Gavril Kachalin, who it was reported had a &quot;healthy respect&quot; for the Belgians. But the team didn&apos;t really turn up. Hugh McIlvanney in the Observer referred to their &quot;pallid indifference&quot;. The Soviets beat them 4-1. They went home after the first round. The Belgians stepped up to the plate in the next major tournament, though, putting out the holders Italy to reach the semi-finals of the European Championship. They lost 2-1 at home to West Germany, a disappointment but hardly a disgrace: the Germans were not long after posting their signature victory against England at Wembley in the quarters, while their two-goal slayer, Gerd Muller, was in the middle of a run which saw him score 85 goals in the calendar year. The Guardian reported that &quot;some of the best shooting came from Leon Semmeling and Van Himst&quot;, while &quot;a most valiant attempt to prise open this German side&quot; was made with &quot;wave after wave of Belgian attacks often from six men&quot; breaking around the new Euro champs elect. They gave it a go. As it turned out, that would be this particular vintage&apos;s signature achievement \u2013 the national side&apos;s true glory days were still a decade in the post \u2013 but they were close enough to making another big mark on world football the following year. Belgium were drawn in a 1974 World Cup qualifying group with the fast-emerging Holland. Both sides put away the other group members, Iceland and Norway, without much fuss, but the Dutch ran up a couple of big scores \u2013 9-0 against Norway, 8-1 in Iceland \u2013 which gave them a vastly superior goal difference to Belgium. So when the Dutch scraped a lucky goalless draw in Antwerp in November 1972 \u2013 Jean Thissen hit a post for Belgium \u2013 they effectively only needed another draw when the teams met for the return in Amsterdam 364 days later. Holland got their draw, but only just. Belgium sat back to soak up Dutch pressure for 89 minutes, then in classic rope-a-dope fashion, struck at the death. Van Himst sent a long free kick into the area. Piet Schrijvers flapped. And Jan Verheyen knocked it in. But despite being played on by three defenders, Verheyen was flagged for offside. Holland took their Total Football to the finals, while Belgium \u2013 who went through qualifying without conceding a single goal! \u2013 were out. (You can read more about the match in this typically magnificent feature from the Guardian&apos;s Joy of Bob series.) How would Belgium have done at the finals? Well, who knows, but not badly at all, if friendlies during the run-up to the tournament are anything to go by: they drew 1-1 with Poland, who finished third in the tournament, and were victorious, 2-1, over Scotland, who might have been knocked out early doors as usual but came away unbeaten and having received good notices for once, to boot. Whether Belgium would have made it all the way to the final like the Dutch, en route changing the entire concept of soccer Totally, is probably a bit of a stretch. In any case, Holland made no mistake next time the teams met in a competitive fixture, Rob Rensenbrink (day job: Anderlecht, Brussels, Belgium) scoring a hat-trick in a 5-0 European Championship quarter-final win, the first humiliating leg of a 7-1 aggregate victory. 5) Trinidad and Tobago (1990) In 2006, Trinidad and Tobago became the smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup finals. Iceland may nick off with that record in the next few days, it&apos;s true, but the Soca Warriors will always have Dortmund. We say this just in case it slipped the mind, because otherwise the hard-luck stories of 1974 and 1990 might be too much to bear. Given that T&amp;T made it to Germany, there&apos;s a pleasing symmetry to the story, which begins with them failing to reach West Germany&apos;s 1974 finals by a single point. The decisive match proved to be their visit to Haiti, a team Baby Doc Duvalier was giving close attention, the despot desperate for some reflected glory on the world stage. Baby Doc got his wish, with a little help from the referee, who disallowed not just one, but a remarkably brazen five Trinidad and Tobago goals in the game at Port-au-Prince. Suspicious circumstances having been established, the Salvadorean referee and Canadian linesman were later banned by Fifa for life, but much good it did Trinidad and Tobago, as Haiti had the 2-1 win that propelled them towards the finals. As evidence of how good that Trinidad and Tobago side were, the match that actually rubber-stamped Haiti&apos;s participation in Germany was T&amp;T&apos;s astonishing 4-0 win over regional behemoths Mexico. Fast forward to 1989, and the chase for a place at the 1990 finals in Italy. The door was wide open in the Concacaf qualifiers, as Mexico had been banned for fielding over-age players in the World Youth Cup, and sleeping giants USA hadn&apos;t quite got their chops up yet. A young and exciting T&amp;T team, nicknamed the Strike Squad, featured the upcoming talents of 21-year-old Russell Latapy and 18-year-old Dwight Yorke, players good enough to later win the English, Portuguese and Champions Leagues. Going into the last game, T&amp;T only needed a draw in their last home match against the USA, and the Americans hadn&apos;t scored in 208 minutes. The manager, as in 1973, was Ollie Camps, while his right-hand man Everald &apos;Gally&apos; Cummings was one of the star men from that ill-fated qualification campaign. &quot;The football we play rightly reflects the mood of our nation,&quot; explained Cummings before the game. &quot;It&apos;s relaxed football, calypso football. I don&apos;t think we play any particular style, English or Brazilian. We have a Trinidad style, and we want to take calypso football to Italy.&quot; As it turned out, T&amp;T were far from relaxed. The game kicked off \u2013 church bells across the island celebrated this by pealing non-stop for three minutes \u2013 in front of a 35,000 crowd at the National Stadium in Port of Spain, with another 10,000 outside, desperately trying to squeeze in. The pressure was too much. The Strike Squad only got one strike on target all game. On 38 minutes, the USA&apos;s Paul Caligiuri sent a soft shot swerving past Trinidad keeper Michael Maurice from 25 yards. The dream was over. For another 16 years, anyway, until at the 2006 finals, T&amp;T secured a brave draw with 10 men against Sweden, then held England for 82 minutes until \u2026 \u2026 Crouchy! How could you! So much for happy endings! 6) Denmark (1994) It&apos;s often forgotten how close 1990 world champions West Germany came to missing that year&apos;s finals. They required a win in their final game against Wales to scrape through the qualifiers as one of Europe&apos;s best group runners-up: Malcolm Allen put the Welsh ahead in Cologne before Rudi V\u00f6ller and Thomas Hassler turned it round for the 1982 and 1986 finalists. Had they not managed it, Denmark would have made Italia 90 instead. In fact, as things transpired, due to the byzantine Uefa qualification calculations, Sepp Piontek&apos;s Danes could have made it independently, regardless of what Germany did. A draw in Romania in their final game would have been enough to make it at the expense of their hosts. But the famous Dynamite of Mexico &apos;86 fame was fizzling out by 1989, and a 3-1 loss soaked the fuse. Still, a close shave, though that was nothing compared to the heartbreak that would blow up in their faces four years later. By the time the 1994 finals were the focus, the Danish were the reigning European champions. They started the campaign slowly, with goalless draws in Latvia and Lithuania, then at home to the Republic of Ireland. Those results would eventually cost them, though it proved terribly close nevertheless. Going into the final round of games, Denmark were unbeaten, and had let in only one goal in 11 matches. A draw in Spain would see them through. Problem was, Spain had long been Denmark&apos;s bogey team, having done for them at Euro 84, Mexico 86 and Euro 88. And so it wasn&apos;t to be. Spanish keeper Andoni Zubizarreta was sent off early on for cleaning out Michael Laudrup, but his replacement Santiago Canizares went on to have a stormer. Peter Schmeichel was egregiously blocked off as Fernando Hierro notched for Spain, and while the Laudrup-inspired Danes enjoyed nearly all of the possession, they couldn&apos;t get past the inspired Canizares. Still there was hope, should Jack Charlton&apos;s Republic of Ireland fail to get a point in Belfast against their friends from the north. When Jimmy Quinn scored for Northern Ireland on 74 minutes, it looked on for Denmark, but Alan McLoughlin equalised for the Republic four minutes later. The draw secured, Charlton went under the stand at Windsor Park believing his side had reached the finals. &quot;But when I got inside, the Spain game was still going on on the television,&quot; he later explained. &quot;The guy asked me if I wanted to watch it. &apos;Do I bollocks!&apos; I said. Then he touched me on the shoulder and said: &apos;Now will you look?&apos; And I did, and it had finished 1-0.&quot; Poor old Denmark. And poor old Michael Laudrup, the erstwhile Barcelona and Real Madrid star telling Rob Smyth, Lars Eriksen and Mike Gibbons in their upcoming sure-fire classic Danish Dynamite: The Story of Football&apos;s Greatest Cult Team: &quot;Spanish football has given me so much in terms of club level and what I became. And it has taken so much from me with the national team.&quot;", "sentences": ["So when the Dutch scraped a lucky goalless draw in Antwerp in November 1972 \u2013 Jean Thissen hit a post for Belgium \u2013 they effectively only needed another draw when the teams met for the return in Amsterdam 364 days later."], "title": "The Joy of Six: World Cup qualifying near misses | Scott Murray", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/nov/15/joy-of-six-world-cup-near-misses", "tags": ["World Cup", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-15T12:27:00Z", "article": "Who&apos;s afraid of Ingmar Bergman? Obviously not Ivo van Hove and Toneelgroep Amsterdam, who have devised a radical restaging of Bergman&apos;s microscopic study of a marital breakdown, originally written for Swedish television in 1973. I find the work itself overblown but, until the last 30 minutes of this superbly acted, four-hour version, I was completely gripped. Van Hove clearly believes in the rule of three: three sets of actors play Marianne and Johan, the audience is initially divided into three groups and we move, in the first half, through three different acting areas to watch the progressive decline of their relationship. In a touch Alan Ayckbourn might envy, even as we watch the young Marianne and Johan hosting a dinner party, we catch fleeting glimpses through a window of their mature selves. Spatial experiment is combined with hyper-realism as we become intimate eavesdroppers on the collapse of a marriage. There are warning signs from the beginning when Marianne (the stunning Suzanne Grotenhuis) announces as if she were tiptoeing over a minefield that she is expecting another child. By the time the older Johan (Hugo Koolschijn) reveals that he is deserting Marianne (Janni Goslinga) for a 23-year-old, the pain is palpable: it is agonising to see her neatly fold his clothes in a vain attempt to keep the marriage alive. In the second half, the audience and the three versions of Marianne and Johan come together, literally in their case, in a single space. The scene where, on the point of signing divorce papers, they have sex and then engage in a body-pummelling fight is extraordinary. I still think Bergman&apos;s script tells us too little about how the couple&apos;s careers as a divorce lawyer and an academic affect their private lives, and elevates the psychological above the social. But the entire cast is excellent, and van Hove&apos;s production offers us a ringside seat at the spectacle of a love-hate relationship, one in which even the most sanguine will find an echo of their own experience.  \u2022 Did you catch this show \u2013 or any other recently?

The recent surge in its popularity has been a grassroots phenomenon, prompted by overcrowded and expensive public transport, a large number of young, talented people on low wages and a wider recognition of its health and environmental benefits. As demonstrated by the recent toll of cycling fatalities, the response from the authorities has been slow, inadequate and, in the case of the appalling Cycle Superhighway 2 in east London, counterproductive. There has been no sense of urgency about improving cyclists&apos; safety. Transport for London&apos;s long-awaited freight strategy to reduce lorry journeys at peak times to avoid conflict with cyclists has not materialised, despite the fact that during the Olympics a very similar scheme was successfully deployed. While cycling remains relatively safe, TfL&apos;s statistics show that every journey carries a 10% greater risk of resulting in a serious injury or death than in 2008. The Cycling Vision drawn up by Boris Johnson&apos;s cycling tsar, the journalist Andrew Gilligan, is commendable, but lacks both urgency and the coherent thread that would deliver safe cycling for all. One of London&apos;s rival global cities, New York, is demonstrating what could be done immediately. The city&apos;s transport commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, has embarked on a radical plan to improve the lot of pedestrians and cyclists. Times Square, for decades a permanent traffic jam, has been turned into a space so peaceful that the city authorities installed deckchairs in the summer; local businesses have boomed. Crucially, it&apos;s not just Times Square \u2013 50 spaces in suburban centres have been improved in the same way. All this has been done quickly and experimentally, allowing unsuccessful aspects to be reversed, using principally, as Ms Sadik-Khan put it, &quot;paint and plastic&quot; to reroute traffic and create usable spaces. This is not, as she emphasises in a brilliant TED talk available online, just about cycling. Creating a city fit for cyclists also ensures it is a better place in which to live and work. The lesson from New York is that things can change and quickly. What is needed is a strong political vision and the boldness to implement it. Take Seville, often reckoned too hot and cramped for cyclists, which has gone from 2,000 cycle trips per day to 72,000 in seven years, thanks to mayor Alfredo S\u00e1nchez Monteseir\u00edn&apos;s strategy of building cycle lanes, reducing road space for cars and launching a cycle hire scheme. That answers the naysayers who argue that London is not Amsterdam or its streets are too narrow. Britain is dependent for its future on attracting bright young people, They are the ones most likely to hop on their bikes and consequently they make up a disproportionate number of these tragedies. They deserve the infrastructure to travel safely, arriving at their destination in one piece, rather than having their lives shattered by a 40-tonne truck or a double-decker bus \u2013 and we should recognise it is our duty to safeguard their futures in this way.

Walking the streets of the Netherlands&apos; second-largest city is like trawling a back catalogue of architects&apos; bold dreams and daring attempts. There are buildings shaped like sharpened pencils and forests of floating cubes, towers dressed in bright red pinstripes and blue harlequin chequers, odd lumps and improbable cantilevers thrusting out in all directions. All this is the consequence of the city suffering a bombardment of two things: bombs and architects. Rotterdam was flattened by the Luftwaffe during the second world war and has since served as a hotbed of experimentation, becoming a natural home for the country&apos;s architectural avant garde. Since the construction of Europe&apos;s first pedestrian shopping zone here in 1953, an idea imported from the US along with kiosks in the shape of oranges and hot dogs, the city has thrived on promiscuous sampling. It is a jumble of bits and pieces, full of echoes of elsewhere, giving the overall impression of paper-thin surfaces held together in an energetic collage. Now the country&apos;s most celebrated architect, Rem Koolhaas, has just completed the nation&apos;s largest building here, and one of the biggest in Europe. It is a gleaming beacon of prosperity, a monument to Rotterdam&apos;s rude economic health \u2013 built at a time when scores of such office blocks lie vacant across the city. Given the implausible context, De\u00a0Rotterdam seems appropriately unreal, a dreamlike stage set of financial capital that takes the city&apos;s cut-and-paste urbanism to the next extreme. Filling a hefty chunk of the southern skyline, at 150 metres tall and more than 100 metres wide, De\u00a0Rotterdam looks like someone has sliced up the drawings and stuck them on the horizon \u2013 but not put the pieces back together quite right. Four simple office blocks rise from an elevated podium, only to be cut in half and shuffled up in the wrong order, like a game of architectural Misfits. The resulting form is of a skyline perched precariously on top of another skyline, each block resting on the shoulder of the next in a staggered huddle. The entire thing is clad in a continuous surface of slender aluminium mullions from top to bottom, which shimmer like silvery corduroy, recalling New York skyscrapers of the 1960s. It could be the twin towers of the World Trade Center, resurrected in a Frankenstein muddle.     Manhattanism brought back to the hometown ... De Rotterdam. Photograph: Ossip Van Duivenbode Photograph: Ossip Van Duivenbode    In the headquarters of Koolhaas&apos;s Office for Metropolitan Architecture (now simply OMA), to the north of the city, where armies of bleary-eyed interns are summoning mysterious shapes from blocks of blue Styrofoam, there is a mild panic of public relations staffers. Rem has arrived, and overturned their plans: he wants to drive me to the building himself. &quot;This is our longest-running project,&quot; he says, awkwardly folding his tall frame into the bucket seat of his black BMW sports car, as his assistants scramble into a car behind. &quot;It began in 1997, but it only became possible to build it during the financial crisis \u2013 when the contractors were cheap enough to do it.&quot; A literal product of the recession, this sharply tailored corporate leviathan is conceived as a &quot;vertical city&quot;, housing not just 70,000 sq m of office space, but 240 apartments in the block to the west, and a 285-room boutique hotel in the block to the east, sitting on a chunky plinth of conference facilities, car parking and restaurants. It is the latest \u20ac340m (\u00a3285m) part of &quot;Manhattan on the Maas,&quot; a vision launched in the early 1990s to transform the Wilhelminapier, a little spit of land on the south bank of the River Maas, into something resembling New York \u2013 if you squint a bit. As we roar through the city centre at ferocious speed, the site comes into view. In among the majestic old brick warehouses of the shipping trade now stands a brash collection of starchitects&apos; castoffs. There is a squarish stone shaft by Alvaro Siza, an irregular stack of coloured blocks by Mecanoo, a glowering grey hulk by Norman Foster and a convoluted assemblage by Renzo Piano, complete with a leaning wall of LEDs. With blocks of childlike simplicity, wrapped in a sleek skin of delicate ribs, Koolhaas&apos;s offering rises above the surrounding din with cool authority. He may be last to the party, but this contribution is bigger and more sophisticated than them all. &quot;The most important thing about this project is your perception of its size and mass as you drive over the bridge,&quot; says Koolhaas, hunched over the wheel, his frail voice barely audible above the roar of the engine, as we begin our ascent of the boomerang-shaped road of the Erasmus Bridge. &quot;We calculated how the view would change as you approach along this curving path.&quot; When you first see it on the horizon, the building seems scale-less. It could be a miniature model or a massive mountain, the blocks slipping and sliding past each other with no recognisable sense of proportion. It looks utterly surreal, glimmering like a\u00a0mirage in the low winter sun. It is an effect Koolhaas has been pondering since 1979, when he designed an unrealised scheme for the other side of the river, predicated on the same idea of a wall of shuffling blocks. &quot;Any structure will be noted in passing, at bewilderingly different speeds and angles,&quot; he wrote of the riverside Boompjes site, a few hundred metres to the northeast. By slicing the blocks up, he continued, &quot;the slits between the towers \u2026 deliver more than openness; the experience of passing the slab shows stroboscopic flashes of the city&quot;. With characteristic certainty, he concluded that this effect created &quot;an accordion movement that made the composition of &apos;towerslab&apos; infinitely dynamic&quot;. More than 30 years later, and after 16\u00a0years of development (De Rotterdam began in 1997, but has stopped and started ever since), Koolhaas&apos;s dynamic &quot;towerslab&quot; has now been realised. But is it anything more than an optical trick, a game of dancing facades best viewed from a distance? &quot;That&apos;s all you need to see. The rest is just a cheap office building,&quot; he says, before leaving me to explore the interior for myself.     'Vertical living' ... De Rotterdam. Photograph: Ossip Van Duivenbode Photograph: Ossip Van Duivenbode    Like other recent mega-projects by OMA, such as the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, most effort has gone into composing a beguiling envelope, leaving the interior to prosaic commercial realities. There are some attempts within the gargantuan floors to choreograph moments of drama and intrigue. You enter into a lofty lobby space, where banks of escalators rise through a seven-storey atrium, past glazed walls of car parking \u2013 a grittiness that jars nicely with the world of silver marble below. In places, the effect of having chunks of the building stick out up to eight metres makes itself felt: vast concrete trusses march across the floor, forming great structural V&apos;s and W&apos;s. Earlier designs made a bigger show of this zig-zag construction on the facade, but cost-cutting reduced structure to the essential, rather than theatrical. The apartments \u2013 which will be some of the most expensive in the city \u2013 offer spectacular views, but as you might imagine, they feel a little like living in an office, staring out through those densely spaced mullions. The novelty of &quot;vertical city&quot; living, where you get out of bed only six metres away from someone at a desk, might wear off fairly quickly, too.     Frankenstein muddle ... De Rotterdam. Photograph: Ossip Van Duivenbode Photograph: Ossip Van Duivenbode    It is too early to tell how this Goliath will function when its floors have been filled, but there remains a strong sense of uncertainty as to who or what will occupy this ample acreage. A speculative building initiated by a private developer, it only went ahead when the municipal government agreed to rent a substantial chunk of the office space. In doing so, it will vacate two other towers to the west of the city, designed by SOM in the 70s, which it rescued in the same way when the real estate market crashed in 1976. As history repeats itself, so continues the vicious cycle of speculation, developers cheered on and bailed out by the government, thirsty for the next iconic project that will bring the magic fairy-dust of inward investment. Or\u00a0will it? &quot;The building is a cynical and brutal monument to the city&apos;s delusions of grandeur,&quot; says Wouter Vanstiphout, professor of design and politics at Delft university. &quot;While Amsterdam is trying to fill its empty offices, Rotterdam is building more and more, but there&apos;s no one to go in them. It is madness when there is 30% vacancy across the city \u2013 it follows the same logic as saying, &apos;Let&apos;s build houses, because we need more\u00a0people.&apos;&quot; I put this to Koolhaas, but he shrugs it off. &quot;It&apos;s the same across Europe,&quot; he says, batting away the idea that he might be fuelling the city&apos;s vanity. &quot;Buildings aren&apos;t empty for ever, and we&apos;ve designed this to accommodate any amount of change.&quot; For him, De Rotterdam is the culmination of a more personal story. It represents the realisation of a decades-long fixation with the thrilling hyper-density of &quot;Manhattanism&quot;, first cultivated in his student manifesto, Delirious New York. At the age of 68, he has finally brought back a contorted slice of that city&apos;s vertiginous madness to his home town. There is a sense of nostalgia in his voice as he drops me on the street corner, before driving off to his next appointment. &quot;The weird thing is that this building might look cold or harsh, but we get grandmothers now writing to us saying they like it. Which has never happened before.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;While Amsterdam is trying to fill its empty offices, Rotterdam is building more and more, but there&apos;s no one to go in them."], "title": "Rem Koolhaas's De Rotterdam: cut and paste architecture", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/18/rem-koolhaas-de-rotterdam-building", "tags": ["Rem Koolhaas", "Architecture", "Art and design", "Rotterdam holidays", "Netherlands holidays", "Culture", "Cities"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-18T07:55:14Z", "article": "Name: The Grant quaggaSpecies: Equus quagga quaggaDates: 19th centuryClaim to fame: Jumped species (some feat with only three legs)Go visit: The Grant Museum of Zoology, UCL In 1972, a zoologist put two skulls on the table. One of them, he knew, had come from a male quagga that had lived and died at London Zoo. The other, as far as anyone knew, was just a regular female zebra. All was not as it seemed. Up until that moment, the Grant Museum of Zoology at University College London had been the proud owner of two near-complete, articulated zebra skeletons. But there was a rumour passed down from curator to curator that one of them \u2013 affectionately known as Z581 \u2013 was, in fact, a quagga. To settle the matter, the skull of the Grant equid travelled across London to South Kensington to be placed under the expert eye of Alan Gentry, then curator of mammals at the Natural History Museum. After careful inspection, comparing the enigmatic Grant specimen with other zebras and the single quagga in the Natural History Museum collection, Gentry reached his conclusion: \u201cZ581 can be taken quite safely as E. quagga,\u201d he wrote.     The skull of Z581, as it appeared in the Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History). Photograph: Natural History Museum    There are surprisingly few quagga skeletons in existence: this pimped-up zebra was hunted to extinction from its native South Africa so quickly that few specimens made it into collections. So once back at the Grant Museum, the zebra-now-quagga skeleton was afforded special treatment. Today \u2013 some 40 years later \u2013 it is one of the museum\u2019s most popular exhibits, its legs straddling a box of dodo bones in a case of \u201cExtinct and Endangered Animals\u201d just inside the entrance. The glass on this case is particularly grubby, smeared with greasy fingerprints, handprints, noseprints, forehead prints, hairprints and probably even saliva of the zoologically curious. The Grant Museum\u2019s other zebra skeleton has not been quite so fortunate, perhaps because it turns out to have been misclassified too. It is not a zebra either, but instead of being promoted to more rarefied taxonomic heights as was the case for Z581, the second zebra faced demotion to donkey. It now hangs from a distant balcony in the museum (which used to be the library of the University College Hospital Medical School), looking down on its more celebrated cousin. When did the Grant Museum come by its quagga? In either 1877 or 1910, says museum manager Jack Ashby. Why the uncertainty? The records show that the museum acquired a zebra in each of these two years, but there\u2019s insufficient information to work out which became quagga and which became donkey. As the quagga is thought to have gone extinct in the wild in the 1870s, it\u2019s tempting to suggest that the Grant Museum\u2019s zebra-turned-quagga must have come from one of the few captive animals kicking their hooves in European zoos at the time (the last quagga perished at Amsterdam Zoo in 1883). Although most of the skeletons of most of these individuals are accounted for, there is one possible candidate: a quagga mare that arrived in Antwerp Zoo in 1851. \u201cThis could possibly be the one at the Grant Museum,\u201d according to an in-depth quagga report produced by a group of dedicated UCL students. I imagine the journey of this beast from zoo animal into museum artifact and find it difficult to believe that its quagganess could have been lost in transition. Ashby plays devil\u2019s advocate: perhaps the person who acquired the specimen didn&apos;t consider the distinction between quagga and other zebra important, he suggests, \u201cthat they acquired it to represent \u201czebras\u201d in the collection.\u201d He\u2019s got a point. After all, the principal reason Robert Grant and his successors amassed zoological specimens at all was not to study the minute variation within species or between closely related species (an activity that many zoologists were getting excited about at the time) but to give medical students an overview of comparative anatomy. Yet it still seems more likely that the Grant quagga entered the collection several decades later in 1910, when the museum acquired a miscellaneous collection of skulls and skeletons from the University of London Loan Collection. This, it seems to me, is just the kind of path a lost quagga might take. What are the origins of the University of London Loan Collection? I\u2019m not the first person to ask. During a recent visit to the Grant Museum to meet the quagga face to toothy skull, I happened to bump into former curator Rosina Down, who had overseen the metamorphosis of zebra into quagga in the 1970s. She too had wondered where the Loan Collection had come from and one of her correspondents suggested \u201cthe medical museum of a medical school.\u201d I have a hunch which one. In 1904, surgeon Graham Renshaw penned a series of zoological essays, one of them on the by-then-extinct quagga in which he reported examining \u201can equine skeleton alleged to be that of a quagga\u201d at the Medical Museum of Owen\u2019s College in Manchester. \u201cI have carefully examined this specimen, and think it is authentic,\u201d he wrote in Natural History Essays. If I\u2019m right, this would peel away another layer of the Grant quagga\u2019s story but we\u2019d only be left with another puzzle. When and how did the animal reach Manchester? Apart from its mysterious origins and its confused taxonomic record, the Grant quagga is notable for one other feature: a missing leg, lost in action during World War II.     The Grant quagga with its missing leg. Photograph: Grant Museum of Zoology, UCL    There are two stories that might explain this absence, says Ashby. In one, the leg was on loan to the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons and went up in flames (along with a third of the museum\u2019s specimens) when a German bomb landed on the site in Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields. In the other, the leg went AWOL when the Grant Museum evacuated its specimens to Bangor for the duration of the war. We just don\u2019t know, shrugs Ashby. Tale ends The act of researching the story of Grant quagga has raised several questions. If you can help solve any of these outstanding animal-related mysteries, please leave a comment or send me a message on Twitter @WayOfThePanda.  What was the fate of the female quagga that arrived at Antwerp Zoo in 1851? What happened to her skin and skeleton after death? The medical museum at Owen\u2019s College \u201ccame from a merging of older anatomical schools, including the large one on Pine Street,\u201d says Sam Alberti, director of museums and archives at the Royal College of Surgeons and the author of Nature and Culture: Objects, Disciplines and the Manchester Museum. Could this have provided the specimens for the University of London Loan Collection?

Rotterdam, the famous Dutch university city, is building a captivating new infrastructure, but not out of vanity. If it doesn&apos;t come up with innovative solutions, the city is set to lose its battle with climate change. &quot;We&apos;re really planning ahead&quot;, says Alexandra van Huffelen, Rotterdam&apos;s vice mayor in charge of sustainability. &quot;The Dutch have lived below the sea level for centuries and are used to dykes and barriers. But today we&apos;re experiencing heavier and more unpredictable rainfalls, so behind the barriers we&apos;re turning the city into a sponge.&quot; A crucial sponge. Surrounded by water on four sides, this delta city of some 600,000 people can&apos;t flush the sudden stormwater away. Instead, it has embarked on a climate change adaptation strategy that turns every conceivable area into water storage. &quot;We have squares that are set lower than the surrounding streets and pavements that will function as water plazas and fill themselves up with water&quot;, explains van Huffelen. &quot;We&apos;ve also built water storage facilities, for example an underground parking garage with a basin the size of four Olympic swimming pools. And we&apos;ve introduced more green areas, including green roofs and green facades, that will be able to absorb water as well.&quot; You can even watch a livestream of the Benthemplein water plaza, which will be completed on 4 December, being built. The city is also in the process of building a floating neighbourhood, to be completed within the next three years, that will feature homes, offices, a school, a park and even a dairy factory. More are planned in future. A floating pavilion in the inner harbour is being used as a conference centre.     Rotterdam floating pavilion Photograph: Marc Heeman    If this sounds surprisingly positive, it&apos;s because Rotterdam sees climate change adaptation as a selling point. Local companies involved in building the futuristic solutions report doing good business selling their expertise to other cities. &quot;The world makes its money in big cities, so they have to be operational, which means they&apos;ll need climate change protection and infrastructure&quot;, notes Piet Dircke, director of global water management for the Dutch-based company Arcadis, which advises cities from Jakarta to New York on climate change adaptation. &quot;It&apos;s a good business opportunity. For me, being from Rotterdam is good because Rotterdam is a living showcase of climate change adaptation.&quot; New Orleans has paid Arcadis a $200m consulting fee, and Dircke predicts large contracts as booming cities in Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America develop comprehensive adaptation strategies. &quot;Of course it won&apos;t just be Dutch companies getting the contracts&quot;, he acknowledges. &quot;But we have something to show the world.&quot; According to Jeroen Aerts, professor of water and risk management at VU University in Amsterdam, the reason Rotterdam is ahead is that it has integrated its plan with the private sector. &quot;That will become the blueprint for the future,&quot; he says. Cities have so little space that they&apos;ve no choice but to make their limited area climate change-proof, he adds. &quot;Sometimes it costs a bit more, but the investment will pay off in the long term, and often it leads to innovation. In the past, the Netherlands exported dykes. Now it exports comprehensive climate change solutions.&quot; Still, despite all the innovative sponging and water storage, Rotterdam&apos;s residents aren&apos;t fully protected against floods. But city officials point out that the only alternative is to seal off certain neighborhoods during storms \u2013 and in such a densely populated city, that&apos;s not a realistic option. &quot;We have to learn to live with more water&quot;, says van Huffelen. &quot;People should be prepared for the fact that we&apos;ll have floods at least once a year.&quot; As Rotterdam&apos;s chief water engineer, Daniel Goedbloed is charged with trying to bridge the gap between public and private storm preparedness. &quot;Streets will inevitably flood, so we have to make sure that houses don&apos;t flood along with them,&quot; he explains &quot;It&apos;s a tricky issue, because as a municipality we have power over the public domain, but we have to get companies and residents to work with us on adapting houses.&quot; In an initial step, one neighbourhood is now fully storm-adapted, with residents in every house having moved wiring from the basement to an upper floor to prevent power outages when the basement is flooded, and replaced wooden floors with floor coverings that better resist water. The city is subsidising green roofs with a 50% discount, and training roofers to install them rather than asphalt ones. It&apos;s also considering tax schemes that would, for example, give residents who collect rainwater a reduction on their sewage tax. Since 2008, Rotterdam has planted 140,000 square meters of green roofs, and expects to have over 200,000 square meters by next year. Van Huffelen proudly reports that city delegations from around the world now arrive weekly to study Rotterdam&apos;s climate change adaptation. In future, innovative climate change adaptation may even overtake Erasmus as Rotterdam&apos;s number one claim to fame.", "sentences": ["&quot;But we have something to show the world.&quot; According to Jeroen Aerts, professor of water and risk management at VU University in Amsterdam, the reason Rotterdam is ahead is that it has integrated its plan with the private sector."], "title": "Rotterdam: designing a flood-proof city to withstand climate change", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rotterdam-flood-proof-climate-change", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability", "Climate change", "Strategy", "Cities", "Rotterdam", "Netherlands", "Climate change", "Water", "Flooding", "Design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-18T18:20:12Z", "article": "Inhaling deeply from a large joint of unadulterated cannabis, Marcelo Vasquez grins at the imminent prospect of his outlawed passion becoming Uruguay&apos;s newest state-sanctioned industry. This week, the country&apos;s senate is expected to pass the world&apos;s most far-reaching drug legalisation, which should transform Vasquez from a petty criminal into a registered user, grower and ultimately, he hopes, a respected contributor to society. That would be quite a change. After a police raid earlier this year, Vasquez \u2013 whose home doubles as a marijuana nursery \u2013 was jailed and 70 of his plants were confiscated. But the court case that followed now looks likely to go down as one of the last cannabis trials in his country&apos;s history. The marijuana regulation bill, which has been passed by the lower house of the Uruguayan parliament, will allow registered users to buy up to 40g a month from a chemist&apos;s, registered growers to keep up to six plants, and cannabis clubs to have up to 45 members and cultivate as many as 99 plants. Vasquez, who smokes four joints a day, is delighted. &quot;It&apos;s a great step forward that couldn&apos;t happen anywhere but here,&quot; he says. &quot;There&apos;s a lot more to marijuana than smoking and getting high.&quot; This is not just the spliff talking. With the new law, Uruguay will go further than any other nation in exploring the potential benefits and risks of marijuana. The government is designing a new set of legal, commercial and bureaucratic tools to supplant a violent illegal market in narcotics, improve public health, protect individual rights, raise tax revenues and research the medical potential of the world&apos;s most widely used contraband drug. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that there are 162 million cannabis users \u2013 4% of the world&apos;s adult population (pdf). Most countries have followed a policy of prohibition for decades, but there are signs of change. Amsterdam&apos;s coffee shops still offer cannabis on their menus despite a recent tightening of the rules in the Netherlands. Dozens of US states have decriminalised or ceased penalising users of the drug. Washington and Colorado recently introduced a cannabis tax and California has steadily blurred the line between medical and recreational use. In the UK, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, has ordered a review of existing drug policies and is expected to recommend that Britain relaxes its controls. But no government has put in place a structure as all-encompassing and supportive as that envisaged in Uruguay.     A supporter of the legalisation of marijuana at a rally in Montevideo in May this year.  Photograph: Leo Carre O/Demotix/Corbis    &quot;We&apos;ll be the first country to have a regulatory framework for marijuana production, distribution, sale, consumption and medical research,&quot; says Julio Bango, one of the legislators who drafted the bill. &quot;This is an experiment without a doubt and it will have a demonstrable effect. That could be important for the world because it could be the start of a new paradigm.&quot; Uruguay is trying to bring the cannabis market under state control by undercutting and outlawing the traffickers. If the bill is passed, the government will arrange for a high-quality, legal product to be sold in a safe environment at a price that competes with that offered by illegal dealers. &quot;If one gram costs $1 in the black market, then we&apos;ll sell the legal product for $1. If they drop the price to 75 cents, then we&apos;ll put it at that level,&quot; says Julio Calzada, a presidential adviser and the head of the National Secretariat on Drugs. Most cannabis sold in Uruguay is of poor quality and smuggled in from Paraguay. In future, the government will license firms to produce local products grown in monitored conditions, which will then be sold to registered users through pharmacies. As in the case of tobacco, cannabis suppliers will not be allowed to advertise their product. Following moves to legalise same-sex marriage and abortion, this measure is likely to reinforce Uruguay&apos;s growing reputation as a bastion of tolerance and progressiveness in Latin America. But President Jos\u00e9 Mujica dismisses talk of liberality. A reluctant advocate of marijuana regulation, he says that this is the only way to stem the tide of the illegal drug trade, which has had dire consequences for individuals and wider society across Latin America. &quot;This is not about being free and open. It&apos;s a logical step. We want to take users away from clandestine business,&quot; Mujica tells the Guardian. &quot;We don&apos;t defend marijuana or any other addiction. But worse than any drug is trafficking.&quot; Rather than liberalism, Uruguay&apos;s actions are better explained by a long and pragmatic tradition of market intervention and nationalisation. The state controls core energy and telecoms industries, it fixes prices for essentials such as milk and water, and it pioneered some of the tightest controls on tobacco in the world. This small country also boasts an impressive record for drug seizures, with an estimated 10% of the total market intercepted by law enforcement authorities, compared with a world average of less than 5%. Until recently, Uruguay had avoided the epidemic levels of illegal narcotic trafficking that are far more pronounced in Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Mexico. The country is winning individual battles, says Mujica \u2013 but systematically losing the war. The growing popularity of pasta base \u2013 a highly addictive, crack-like drug \u2013 and an increase in drug-related murders has prompted him to act against the dealers by destroying their competitiveness in the biggest illegal market: marijuana. This is the heart of the drug problem, says Calzada. &quot;Ninety per cent of drug users in Uruguay and the world only use marijuana so illegal markets are structured around that even though there are other drugs with a better yield, such as cocaine and LSD. It&apos;s like an off-licence that earns its highest profits from selling whiskey, but makes much more money by selling beer because there are 100 beer sales for every one bottle of whiskey.&quot; Marijuana also has the advantage of being less harmful, not accounting for even one of the 80 registered deaths linked to drug trafficking in Uruguay last year. By opening the door to regulation of cannabis, Calzada says the government has an alternative to the &quot;war on drugs&quot; approach, which has created more problems than it has solved. &quot;For 50 years, we have tried to tackle the drug problem with only one tool \u2013 penalisation \u2013 and that has failed. As a result, we now have more consumers, bigger criminal organisations, money laundering, arms trafficking and collateral damage. As a control model, we&apos;re convinced that it is more harmful than the drugs themselves.&quot; But critics say that Uruguay is taking a huge risk that could result in a wave of new addictions. &quot;If legalisation goes ahead, I think the social damage will be enormous,&quot; says Nancy Alonso, who runs the Manantiales Foundation, a private addiction treatment centre. &quot;Marijuana may seem innocent, but it is addictive, 15 times more carcinogenic than tobacco and produces psychological disorders including depression, anxiety and occasionally schizophrenia.&quot;More importantly, she says cannabis is a gateway drug that leads users to harder narcotics. Juvenile residents at the treatment centre say their experience backs up such claims.     Uruguayan president Jos\u00e9 Mujicas is a reluctant advocate of cannabis regulation. 'We don\u2019t defend marijuana or any other addiction,' he says. Photograph: Andres Stapff/Reuters    &quot;I started with marijuana when I was 13 or 14 and then moved on to cocaine because I wanted something stronger,&quot; said Helen, a 15 year old. &quot;If drugs are legalised, more people will consume them.&quot; The public too have yet to be convinced. A Factum poll in October showed 29% approved of legalisation. Although sharply up from the 3% support levels of 10 years ago, this means the policy is still a potential vote loser. Supporters of the measure hope hard data will win over the doubters. Once the marijuana business moves out of the shadows, its size will be clearer, monitoring will be easier and taxes can be levied and used to fund treatment of addicts and a more focused crackdown on harder drugs. Although the government is prepared to lose money to out-bid the traffickers in the initial stage, once the state has a monopoly, the potential revenues are considerable. The authorities estimate that 10% of adult Uruguayans \u2013 115,000 people \u2013 smoke cannabis. Existing law permits consumption of &quot;reasonable&quot; amounts of marijuana, but forbids sales. The new law should clear up this legal contradiction. The government will set up a Cannabis Research Institute, which will monitor the programme, handle approvals of seeds, establish policies for research and regulate the industry. The market in Uruguay is estimated to be worth $30m a year, according to Martin Fern\u00e1ndez, a lawyer working for the Association of Cannabis Studies, who says one in five Uruguayans have tried marijuana. But he admits the numbers are sketchy. &quot;It is hard to measure the illegal market, just as it is with human and illegal arms trafficking,&quot; he says. &quot;But with legalisation, we should get a clear idea of the situation.&quot; Many are eying new business opportunities. At street level, the passage of the bill is likely to boost shops selling growing kits. In downtown Montevideo, one such store, UruGrow, is already seeing a sharp rise in demand for soil, grow tents, fertiliser and other products. &quot;We&apos;re expanding fast,&quot; said one of the founders, Juan Andr\u00e9s &quot;Guano&quot; Palese. &quot;Six months ago, we sold 200 litres of soil a week, now it&apos;s more than 1,000 litres. Soon we&apos;ll need to move into bigger premises.&quot; But the big money is more likely to come from the pharmaceutical industry, which will be freer to develop and test marijuana painkillers and other treatments in Uruguay than in any other country. According to Bango, several big international laboratories have visited Montevideo to discuss possible collaborations or investments. &quot;We have opportunities in the hemp industry and the spread of biotech and marijuana farming, I&apos;ve just returned from a US conference on this subject. There are lots of potential products \u2013 creams, oils, sweets, capsules and products to treat multiple sclerosis and cancer. They all need scientific research to be validated. In other countries that is limited. We don&apos;t have that inconvenience,&quot; said Bango. &quot;I think it will be a new industry for the economy.&quot; Dope tourists could also be lured by cheap, legal, high-quality marijuana, but the authorities are adamant that they last thing they want is for Uruguay to end up as the &quot;Amsterdam of Latin America&quot;. Only residents will be entitled to buy cannabis. Re-sales are prohibited. Coffee shop that put Indica, Sativa or Hash Browns on their menu will be closed down. &quot;We are trying to learn from the mistakes made by other countries,&quot; Fernandez says. Juan Vaz, a marijuana grower and long-time legalisation campaigner, hopes the regulation strategy can be applied to other narcotics. &quot;It would make a big health impact if we could do the same for cocaine, crack and other drugs so users could avoid accidental overdoses. That would also make a lot of profit for the government.&quot; So far, however, Uruguayan officials have dismissed suggestions that they might use the same approach for harder drugs. They say the health risks posed by cocaine and heroin are far greater than those associated with marijuana so they require a different strategy. Nonetheless if the senate passes the cannabis bill as expected, it won&apos;t only be the country&apos;s smokers who are delighted. Several Latin American leaders have also called for a shift from the current prohibition approach as the war on drugs takes a rising death toll with no sign of victory. Uruguay, once again, looks set to take the first step for the region. Vaz, who spent 11 months in prison for marijuana growing, says he now feels responsible for making the policy a success. &quot;I will celebrate. It will be a victory. For many years we have been asking for this. Now we can ask nothing more,&quot; he says. &quot;Now it is up to us to make it work.&quot; Additional research by Mauricio Rabuffetti ", "sentences": ["Amsterdam&apos;s coffee shops still offer cannabis on their menus despite a recent tightening of the rules in the Netherlands.", "&quot;I think it will be a new industry for the economy.&quot; Dope tourists could also be lured by cheap, legal, high-quality marijuana, but the authorities are adamant that they last thing they want is for Uruguay to end up as the &quot;Amsterdam of Latin America&quot;."], "title": "Uruguay's likely cannabis law could set tone for war on drugs in Latin America", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/uruguay-cannabis-law-war-on-drugs-marijuana", "tags": ["Uruguay", "Cannabis", "Drugs trade", "Drugs", "Society", "World news", "Americas"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-19T16:37:00Z", "article": "Terry Townshend, deputy secretary general: policy, The Global Legislators Organisation (Globe International), Beijing, China. @terrytownshend If you want to get the political establishment on board, watch your language: I think the biggest obstacle to effective climate action has been political, largely driven by ideology and the power of rich corporations over politicians. Political campaign finance reform is absolutely necessary but, until that happens, climate change objectives need to be expressed in language that is not politically divisive. Speak in terms of energy security, risk, air pollution, health and not climate change, green, or saving the planet, which some parts of the political establishment are allergic to. We all need to be on the same page with what &quot;binding&quot; legislation actually means: To me, an international agreement should be built on the foundation of nationally binding legislation: without this, it is worth very little.

Esther Agbarakwe, founder, Nigerian Youth Climate Coalition, Abuja, Nigeria. @estherclimate Understanding how climate change relates to the local context will help drive collaboration: We need to overcome the challenge of how to explain climate change in our local languages without sounding political or with a development narrative. One option is to change the political narrative of climate change to a people-centered narrative. Storytelling can play a big role in achieving this.

Not every scientist needs to be a good public communicator \u2013 we need scientists to be good scientists first and foremost.

As soon as you talk about mitigation, gigatons, percentages, CO2, and so on you&apos;ve probably lost 90% of the public. The &apos;blame game&apos; can actually foster cooperation: I think that laying blame can help lead to collaboration \u2013 people often unite around a common enemy.

Richard Munang, Africa regional climate change co-ordinator, United Nations Environment Programme, Nairobi, Kenya. @mtingem Regional coalitions can be really valuable: Political boundaries do not always follow ecological boundaries, and wise policymakers will see the benefit in collaborating to share resources and solve issues at their core. After evaluating national priorities, policymakers should consider regional approaches. Policymakers need to work together to prioritise adaptation responses: The UNEP report on Africa&apos;s Adaptation Gap, outlines various adaptation actions including the development of ecosystem-based adaptation actions in place of hard infrastructure, conserving biodiversity, and promoting drought-resistant crops and early-warning systems for floods, droughts, or fires. James Greyson, head, BlindSpot Think Tank, Lewes, England. @climate_rescue The movement is held back by semantics: Why mitigate when we should stop or reverse climate chaos? Why accept gradual technical fixes when climate is all about a global systemic shift? We need to look at the common language of climate change and consider whether it is holding us back. Ashok Chandwaney, student and organiser, The Sierra Student Coalition, St Mary&apos;s City, US. @ahumanstory For fair and just climate change policy, include the missing voices: The people who are marginalised in the discussions, like people in the south and indigenous communities, are the ones most affected by climate disruption. If we had policies and treaties that were written or strongly influenced by affected people, instead of those currently in power who benefit from the dirty status quo, they would be more fair, just, and equitable. It is not leadership itself that is absent from the movement, but the right type of leadership: At COP 19, there&apos;s plenty of leadership: from wealthy states, from the conference&apos;s corporate sponsors. The problem is, they&apos;re leading us to the wrong place. We need to put power into the hands of existing leaders in the humanitarian, environmental, and science realms. Robert Laubacher, project director, MIT Climate CoLab, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. @ClimateCoLab Collaboration that starts small can have a big impact: Government progress on climate change, at the international level, and in many key nations is slow moving.

Antonio La Vi\u00f1a, dean, Ateneo School of Government, Ateneo de Manila University, Metro Manila, Philippines. @tonylavs Take a practical approach to collaboration: Success in the area of climate and forests in developing countries has been possible precisely because we have avoided the blame game between north and south. We have instead taken a practical approach and put into place incentives for climate change mitigation and adaptation in forests. While agreement on some technical issues like verification and on an important issue like non-carbon benefits are still being worked on, there is a spirit of collaboration in the UNFCCC negotiations in this area. Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, vice-chair, IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. @JPvanYpersele  Cooperation at the individual level is not enough: Behavioural changes should be supported and encouraged by economic and legislative frameworks. It is important that we get individuals to collaborate on the movement. However, as the IPCC WG3 report has shown, behavioural changes can contribute to reduce emission patterns but changes at the scale of the economy and society are needed as well.

Everyone panics. The impulse is to do something, anything, even if it is the wrong thing. As six cyclists are killed in the capital in 13 days, everyone at City Hall is as horrified as any other Londoner. But if we have a duty at times like this, it is to think straight \u2013 and to talk straight, not to promise things we can&apos;t or shouldn&apos;t do. Not everyone has been thinking straight. The former transport secretary, Lord Adonis, has called for urgent action \u2013 but then, literally in the same breath, demanded a full independent review, something that would delay any action by months. We&apos;ve already had a review. We&apos;re acting urgently, upgrading all our existing superhighways with fully and semi-segregated cycle lanes. We&apos;re doing new segregated tracks, new backstreet quiet routes, remodelling dozens of junctions and spending almost \u00a31bn. Nothing is closer to the mayor&apos;s heart than this. What, I&apos;ve asked many cycle activists, what is it you want us to do that we&apos;re not doing already? The usual answer is &quot;do it quicker&quot;. But we can&apos;t simply slap in panic changes that might make cyclists safer at the expense of other people&apos;s safety. And if we&apos;re reducing roads&apos; traffic capacity, as we are, we need changes over a far wider area to reduce vehicle numbers coming in to those roads. Our plans are the biggest change to inner London&apos;s road network in perhaps 30 years. That is why we cannot, and will not, promise to do this overnight. The other big call is for a morning rush-hour lorry ban. We&apos;re not against it, and we&apos;re studying it \u2013 but the case is finely balanced. Two of this year&apos;s 14 deaths in London could have been prevented by such a ban (the other 12 happened outside the rush hour, or did not involve lorries.) But a ban could have a big impact on the economy \u2013 particularly construction, which would lose a quarter of its winter daylight \u2013 and on Londoners&apos; sleep and health, as lorries unable to move in the mornings start delivering at night. It is claimed that Paris&apos;s lorry ban helped it remain free of cyclist deaths in 2012. Untrue: greater Paris had 17 cyclist deaths last year. Central Paris, equivalent to our Zone 1, had five \u2013 four more than central London. I understand the media furore. I know the people behind it are mostly allies who want what I want. But I worry that they are unwittingly causing great collateral damage to the very thing, cycling itself, that we want to promote. Right now, the message to any would-be cyclist is that you shouldn&apos;t; that the roads are unsafe; and that nothing is being done about it. The word &quot;carnage&quot; is used. But none of these things is true either. In 2002, London had 110 million cycle trips, of which 20 ended in death. By last year, there were 180 million trips and 14 deaths \u2013 a reduction per trip of more than half. That is not &quot;carnage&quot;. Serious injury rates are the same as they were 10 years ago. I fear the furore is aiding those who say we shouldn&apos;t encourage cycling. I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s scaring cyclists away. And I&apos;m worried that in trying to help cyclists City Hall is treated as if it has nationalised every accident; that we are held responsible for every death and injury on the roads, however caused. That won&apos;t deter Boris Johnson \u2013 but future politicians may conclude it would be easier to avoid the subject. I&apos;m not saying we should stop talking about safety. But we should be more careful how we discuss it \u2013 and in particular, about the conclusions we draw from tragic, but rare, events. The blunt fact is that cyclist deaths tell us relatively little. There are too few of them. In the first half of 2013, only three cyclists died in London \u2013 one every two months. In the recent spate, it was every two days. Are these same streets 30 times more dangerous than just a few months ago? The facts of each death are different. We should not make assumptions before we know those facts. We should particularly not assume, as so many have, that the latest fatalities were the fault of the road design. Indeed, two of the three deaths described as happening &quot;on superhighway 2&quot; actually took place only in its general vicinity. The victims were not using it when they died. We badly need better routes and safer roads. But even the world&apos;s best cycling infrastructure doesn&apos;t immunise you against harm. Even that nirvana called Amsterdam averages six deaths a year, in a city with about the same number of bike trips as London (Amsterdamers cycle more often, but there are fewer of them). The chief executive of the London Cycling Campaign wrote last week: &quot;We want to know when the dying will stop.&quot; Well, we can, and we do, promise to improve safety. But we cannot, and do not, promise to eliminate cyclist deaths. If that is the test the cycling lobby sets us, we, and every large city on Earth, will fail. That is another reason not to turn each individual tragedy into a national emergency.", "sentences": ["Even that nirvana called Amsterdam averages six deaths a year, in a city with about the same number of bike trips as London (Amsterdamers cycle more often, but there are fewer of them)."], "title": "London's cyclist deaths are tragic.

Sweden&apos;s third-largest city is laced with 500km (310 miles) of cycle lanes, more even than in Copenhagen, a short hop across the \u00d6resunds Bridge. About a quarter of all journeys in the city are already made by bike. That is an estimated 100,000 trips a day for the its 307,000 inhabitants. Stockholmers, by contrast, use bikes for fewer than 10% of trips. When I take my daughter to day care in the morning on the back of my bike, the cycle lanes are packed with parents and commuters. Almost all my friends own cargo bikes, which they use to ferry their young families to day care, or to do the weekly shop. Remarkably, in the 10 years from 2003 to 2012, the city has seen only 16 cyclists killed in an accident involving a car. Olle Even\u00e4s, a traffic planner for Malm\u00f6, puts this down to the way the city has built its cycle lanes. &quot;In Malm\u00f6 we have two-way cycle lanes, every single track, which isn&apos;t the case in Copenhagen. We never have painted lanes as cycle tracks; we always have a dedicated surface which is separated from the car traffic by a divider and up a level from car traffic.&quot; The law-abiding nature of the people also helps cut down on fatalities. For Swedes, cycling in the wrong direction on a cycle path or, worse still, on a pavement intended for pedestrians, elicits the sort of outrage people in the UK reserve for those dumping their rubbish on the pavement. The city continues to try to cut car use, aiming to increase cycling&apos;s share of journeys to 30% by 2018. To do this it has earmarked at least 400m kroner (\u00a337m) to be spent on various cycling programmes in the years 2012-19. &quot;This is the money we know we have for sure, but we are going to be spending even more than that,&quot; says Even\u00e4s.Richard Orange     Cyclists in Delhi must compete with rickshaws and the city's seven million cars. Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images    Delhi Size is power on India&apos;s roads and in the\u00a0caste system of transport, cyclists rank just a notch above pedestrians and stray animals. Buses and SUVs rarely, if ever, give way to lesser mortals. Indeed, pedestrians attempting to cross a road here, even with children in tow, are invariably honked\u00a0at while drivers speed towards\u00a0them. By and large, cycling is not a lifestyle choice for the middle classes. Rather, it\u00a0is the default mode of transport for those who cannot afford anything else.\u00a0Labourers, deliverymen and semi-skilled workers such as plumbers and carpenters use bicycles. They are India&apos;s struggling masses, not its moneyed elite. In 2012, according to India&apos;s National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 168,301 people died on its roads. In New Delhi, that includes 78 cyclists and 501 pedestrians. There are nominal cycle lanes on some of the capital&apos;s main thoroughfares, but with seven million cars jostling for space, those lanes are often cannibalised by motorised rickshaws and scooters, leaving no safe space for bicyclists. Cyclists rarely wear helmets and there are no viable emergency services to ferry accident victims to\u00a0hospitals. In recent years, some intrepid middle-class Indian and foreign expatriate cyclists have begun to brave Delhi&apos;s roads. Recognisable by their expensive bicycles, helmets and high-visibility vests, they can sometimes be spotted along the quieter avenues of colonial New Delhi. One company, Delhi by Cycle, has even set up two-wheeled tours through the narrow, twisting lanes of the old city. But they start before dawn, before cars, motorbikes, cycle rickshaws, pushcarts, cows\u00a0and the ever-present crush of pedestrians appear. If cycling in London is dangerous, Delhi is like having a near-death experience every single time. Anu Anand     Cyclists are well-catered for in Berlin, but it still saw 15 cyclist deaths in 2012. Photograph: Adam Berry/Getty Images    Berlin In many ways, Berlin is a cyclists&apos; paradise. Most major roads have clearly marked cycling lanes, either on the pavement or on the road itself. The age\u00a0range of cyclists is broader than in London: with old ladies and kids sharing lanes with bike couriers in Lycra, road behaviour tends to be less aggressive. Some major junctions even have a special set of traffic lights for cyclists, allowing them a head start ahead of\u00a0motorists. That doesn&apos;t mean there are no problems. Fifteen cyclists died in 2012, seven of them through collisions with lorries; 4,533 more were injured over the same period. According to the German Cycling Club (ADFC), one of the most common causes of accidents are cars turning into side streets at high speed and cutting off cyclists in the lanes to\u00a0their right. Berlin&apos;s many tram lines can also be a hazard: the track grooves are perfect for trapping the wheel of your average city bike. In spite of being notoriously cash-strapped, Berlin has taken steps to make cycling safer. This month, the city authorities launched an online survey in order to\u00a0help identify trouble spots. On radsicherheit.berlin.de, users can mark\u00a0dangerous junctions, blocked paths and road potholes, as well as recording &quot;near-misses&quot; that they didn&apos;t log with the police at the time. But Berlin also expects its cyclists to\u00a0stick to the rules more than London does. One reason for this is self-policing: try going down a cycling path on the wrong side of the road, even in an alternative district such as Kreuzberg, and you will soon be bellowed at by other cyclists or by pedestrians. Cycling offences are not just punished with on-the-spot fines: any fine over \u20ac45 (\u00a337.50) also comes with points that show up on your driving licence (which means that, in theory, you can end up with points on your licence before you have even passed your driving test). And, unlike Britain, Germany has a drink-drive limit for cyclists: a blood alcohol content of 0.16%, though some regions have recently tried to lower the limit to the same as that for cars (0.05%). This also explains the German word for a shandy: Radler or &quot;cyclist&quot;, because it\u00a0just about keeps you sober enough to\u00a0stay on your bike.Philip Oltermann     Beijing hopes to have a quarter of its residents cycling by 2015. Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images    Beijing Beijing was once a city of bikes. Now it&apos;s a city of traffic. There are more than 5m cars in Beijing, and they have transformed its once-generous thoroughfares into a noxious, honking mass. Cycling helps me rise above the noise. I bike 5km (3 miles) to work every day, weaving through Ming dynasty-era alleyways, gliding past shadowy government offices, darting among flatbed tricycles hauling mysterious metal tanks. The Chinese capital is notorious for its air pollution, and my commute isn&apos;t always pleasant. But when the smog lifts and the city snaps into focus, it&apos;s the highlight of my day. Along with the freedom comes a fair amount of risk. According to official statistics, cyclists were involved in more than 10,000 of China&apos;s 67,759 traffic accident-related deaths in 2009. Scooters blast through red lights; cars park on the pavements. Nobody wears a helmet. Last winter, I was riding to work when I collided with an auto-rickshaw. They are the sharks of the city&apos;s bike lanes \u2013 vault-sized motorised boxes that are almost as powerful as small cars, but are not required to play by the same rules. It was on the wrong side of the road. I veered left; the driver veered right; I hit the side of the carriage and fell over. The driver, a middle-aged man with oily hair, decided to play the defensive \u2013 he was clearly from the countryside, and if the accident was serious, my medical bills could have wiped out his savings. He pointed his finger at me, yelling. A crowd began to gather. I shot him a middle finger and pedaled away, my right knee bleeding, my handlebars askew. In 2010, the Beijing government announced hopes that by 2015, nearly a\u00a0fourth of the city&apos;s residents would use cycling as their primary mode of transportation. It doesn&apos;t seem likely. The city is too much of a sprawl, its traffic too unruly. There are other reasons, too. On Monday night, I returned to a restaurant where I had parked my one-speed Giant overnight, only to find it missing. A passerby saw me looking, and asked how long I&apos;d left it outside. &quot;Too long, I\u00a0guess,&quot; I said. &quot;You should\u00a0know better,&quot; she replied. &quot;This\u00a0is China.&quot;Jonathan Kaiman     Amsterdam has long had a reputation for 'traffic anarchy', but if it's chaos, it works extremely well. Photograph: David R. Frazier Photolibrary/Alamy    Amsterdam Over the course of my 11 years of daily biking in Amsterdam, I have never worn the helmet I brought with me from the US. No one needs a helmet here. Instead of putting the onus on the cyclists to protect themselves, in Amsterdam the onus is on society to provide a safe environment to ride in. Here, everyone bikes: the young, the old, the tourists. It usually takes me less than an hour to spot three pregnant cyclists. I had never realised how stressed I\u00a0was while biking in America until I biked with relative ease in Amsterdam. Despite the decades-old reputation of Amsterdam&apos;s cyclists for being &quot;traffic anarchists&quot; \u2013 riding through red lights, biking without lights at night, and so on \u2013 it is a chaos that works incredibly well. Most motorists here are also cyclists, which enables them to better anticipate the behaviour of cyclists in traffic. Driving instructors teach new motorists to use their right hand to open their door, which forces the driver to turn, putting them in a better position to see if a cyclist is approaching from behind. Amsterdam is by no means perfect. Cycling fatalities do occur \u2013 estimates say about six a year - but on nothing like the scale that they do in the British capital. And the Dutch do not rest on their laurels with the infrastructure they have created over the past 30 years. I\u00a0am always pleasantly amazed by how the city continues to be improved.Pete Jordan     Paris has taken its V\u00e9lib' scheme of hire bikes to its heart. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    Paris  Paris is extremely proud of the fact it was the first capital to introduce a city-wide free bicycle scheme. Known as V\u00e9lib&apos;, a combination of the words v\u00e9lo (bike) and libert\u00e9 (freedom), it was introduced in 2007 by Socialist mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb. Now approaching retirement, Delano\u00eb considers it one of the great triumphs of his term in office. By 2012, when V\u00e9lib&apos; was celebrating its fifth birthday, there were around 23,000 of the heavy grey bicycles in circulation, more than double the number when it was launched. There are now 1,700 bicycle &quot;stations&quot; \u2013 1,400\u00a0of them in Paris itself and 300 in\u00a0surrounding towns. In 2007, there were just 750. Under the Socialists, the French capital has installed 652km (405 miles) of dedicated cycle routes for the 224,000 Parisians who have signed up to V\u00e9lib&apos;, a figure that will rise to 700km by the end of 2014. Launching several thousand bicycles onto the city&apos;s roads in 2007 caused widespread safety concerns, but they have proven largely unfounded. While cycling around the Arc de Triomphe can be a perilous exercise, with cars coming from all directions following the now largely outdated &quot;priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 droite&quot; rule, the number of accidents involving cyclists between 2007 and 2012 was relatively low: 12 have died, eight of them while using a V\u00e9lib&apos;. More than 660 have been injured, according to police, though most of the injuries were reported as &quot;not serious&quot;. In 2010, 43 people died in accidents on Paris&apos;s streets and boulevards: two cyclists, 18 pedestrians, 17 motorcyclists and scooter riders and six vehicle drivers or passengers, according to the Paris Pr\u00e9fecture de Police. In 2011, not a single cyclist died. Accident investigators say because there are more cyclists around, other road users have become more used to them and are giving them &quot;greater respect&quot;. The rules of the road \u2013 &quot;I don&apos;t ride on the pavement, I respect traffic lights and stop signs, I don&apos;t carry passengers and I don&apos;t ignore no entry signs&quot; \u2013 are posted on each V\u00e9lib&apos; bike.Kim Willsher     Moscow's bike-hire scheme works well in summer \u2013 but is mothballed for the harsh winter months. Photograph: Christian Petersen/Getty Images    Moscow With 10-lane highways cutting through its centre, roads covered in snow and ice for much of the year, and drivers who \u2013 to put it charitably \u2013 do not always obey the letter of the law, Moscow has never been much of a city for cyclists. Those who can afford a car brave the legendary traffic jams, while those that cannot use the ruthlessly efficient metro system. In recent years, however, as the chaos\u00a0of post-communist wild capitalism has subsided and thoughts have turned in some quarters to issues such\u00a0as quality of life and urban planning, bicycles have become a more visible part of Moscow&apos;s fabric. This year, a local equivalent of Boris bikes was even introduced, with the Bank of\u00a0Moscow funding 1,000 bikes and 74\u00a0rental points across the centre of the\u00a0city. It was free to use them for up to half an hour, and just 60p for an hour after that, for those who paid an initial registration fee. The bikes have\u00a0been removed with the onset of winter, but over the summer season nearly 50,000 Muscovites registered for the scheme. Nevertheless, the bikes were still mainly used for cycling along Moscow&apos;s embankments, through its newly renovated parks and along the pedestrianised boulevard ring that runs through the centre. Actually using a bike as a means of getting from A to B along normal roads is still a matter for the brave and the foolhardy, and cyclists on the roads are a rare sight indeed.Shaun Walker     Rome's cyclists hope that their bike-friendly mayor can deliver. Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty Images    Rome With its fabled seven hills, cobbled streets and notoriously chaotic traffic, Rome is not an obvious cycling paradise. A bike-sharing scheme launched in 2008 has been an abject failure. And, for what it&apos;s worth, helmets and hi-vis have never been included in any Italian&apos;s definition of bella figura. Despite the risks to both health and\u00a0image, however, many Romans are choosing to brave the roads and get on their bikes. For the first time in decades, more bikes were sold than cars in the recession-hit Italy of 2011, a trend reflected predominantly in the north but also on the traffic-clogged streets of the capital. Many of those who do brave it insist the city&apos;s off-putting image is unfair: it is hard for cars to speed around the narrow, winding streets of the historic centre, they say. Moreover, Roman motorists, whatever their other defects, are used to looking out for people on two-wheels - it&apos;s just that those wheels tend to belong to a Vespa or Piaggio. But tragedies, of course, do happen. Last year, five people died in accidents involving bicycles, according to the city authorities; one person the year before that; three in 2010, and four in 2009. In July, a 60-year-old man called Domenico Calabr\u00f2 was fatally injured in a collision with a car on the city&apos;s south-eastern outskirts. The man who now finds himself at the centre of the city&apos;s cycling future is the mayor, Ignazio Marino, who was elected in June and has repeatedly spoken of the need to make Rome a more bike-friendly capital. He says he is considering various projects in order to boost cycle use, including the creation of parking lots for 10,000 bikes, a new, more successful cycle-sharing scheme, and 20km more cycle paths to add to the patchy existing network. Marino is himself a keen cyclist, often seen whizzing around town, security staff in tow, on a white Lombardo. Even for him, however, it\u00a0hasn&apos;t been straight-forward: in\u00a0July,\u00a0he fell off. Cycling activists are pleased that their new &quot;first citizen&quot; is a bike-lover, but are still waiting to see if he will keep his promises, says Fausto Bonafaccia, president of the BiciRoma association. &quot;The cycle path situation is improper for a city like Rome, the capital of Italy, where vegetation, disjointedness and potholes represent daily obstacles for those who want to travel by bike,&quot; he says. &quot;Road safety \u2026 does not meet the minimum standards befitting a civilised country and cyclists are always at risk of having an accident in\u00a0the Roman traffic.&quot;Lizzy Davies     Cairo's most fearless road users must be its bakery delivery cyclists. Photograph: Carsten Koall/Getty Images    Cairo  Tell a local that you cycle in Cairo, and more often than not you will be met with a wide-eyed stare. Driving a car is dangerous and frustrating enough, with 42 annual road deaths per 100,000 Egyptians, according to the World Health Organisation. Britain has just 2.75. Cairo&apos;s roads are chaotic, with cars paying little attention to road markings, and gridlocked streets common by mid-afternoon. Lane discipline is not a recognised concept, drivers often reverse down multi-lane highways, and cars will not stop for pedestrians seeking to cross a road until they step out into the speeding traffic. In this environment, there is little concept of cycling as a means of getting across the city. Needless to say, there are no cycle lanes. Many deliverymen do use bikes to pedal around their neighbourhoods \u2013 perhaps Cairo&apos;s most fearless road-users are the cycling bakers who careen through traffic jams balancing vast trays of bread on their heads. But very few commuters cycle, put off by the perceived danger and the\u00a0lack of infrastructure. For some professionals, bikes are associated with the working class, and so have a social stigma \u2013 while some female cyclists report harassment from passersby. But the city&apos;s few energetic bike advocates say that cyclists are slowly on the rise. When the Cairo Cycling Club was founded five years ago, it had just four members. Now it organises weekly recreational group rides through quieter districts that have sometimes attracted hundreds of cyclists. In\u00a0two provincial cities near Cairo, the authorities are planning to encourage more\u00a0cycling along some main roads. There are no exact figures, either for the number of Cairene cyclists or the number of annual cycling-related fatalities. But Ahmed el-Dorghamy, one of Cairo&apos;s most vocal cycling proponents, says there are more than 20,000 users of Egyptian online cycling groups. &quot;The idea we want to get across is that it&apos;s not just a sporting activity,&quot; he told the BBC last year. &quot;It can also be a means of transport in some areas of Cairo.&quot;Patrick Kingsley     New York's busy streets might seem daunting, but things are improving for cyclists. Photograph: Joseph Mcnally/Getty Images    New York If you commute by bike in New York City, you are still regarded by colleagues as something of a daredevil. And if you don&apos;t wear a helmet, they frankly think you are reckless. Mind you, this is a country where they wear helmets for the game they call football (which, actually, does have a serious head-injury problem). But perceptions lag behind reality. New York has become a much more cycle-friendly city over the past decade or so of the Bloomberg administration. Cyclist fatalities have held steady over that time: in a good year, perhaps just a dozen; in a bad year, double that number. But bike use has tripled since 2000 and, with several hundred miles of new bike lanes put in, it is still growing fast. So, according to the City&apos;s &quot;cycling risk indicator&quot;, the danger of serious injury has plummeted by 73% (between 2000 and 2011). And New York is truly a bikeable city. Manhattan and the other boroughs are reasonably flat, and car ownership is the lowest of any American city. The views can be spectacular, whether you are flying down one of the big avenues in a canyon of Gotham skyscrapers or taking the riverside bike path along the Hudson on the west side. Earlier this year, the city got the Citibike bike-share scheme, our equivalent of Boris bikes. Despite teething troubles, the five-month-old rollout is mostly judged a great success \u2013 not least because it has not yet resulted in a single fatality. Not everything is rosy. Transportation Alternatives, NYC&apos;s leading pro-bike campaign, has worked hard recently to make more of an issue of how poorly fatal accidents involving pedestrians or cyclists are often investigated by the NYPD. Just last weekend, an article in the New York Times asked provocatively: &quot;Is it OK to kill cyclists?&quot; But I take heart simply from the fact that the question is being asked: the mindset is\u00a0changing. My main tip from the mean streets: just watch out for the yellow cabs \u2013 they never pull over to drop people off, and passengers will fling the doors open on either side.Matt Seaton is the Guardian&apos;s former cycling columnist and is now an editor at the New York Times.     Tel Aviv's flat, wide-open spaces are ideal for cycling. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    Tel Aviv It is flat, sunny and boasts a sweeping promenade hugging long golden beaches. There are 120km of cycle paths threading throughout the city, 1,500 public bikes for hire at an hourly rate, and 3,000 bicycle parking slots. Welcome to Tel Aviv, cycling heaven. That, at least, is the city council&apos;s vision. As part of a plan to turn Tel Aviv into a car-free city, it has promoted two-wheel transport, with the introduction two years ago of Tel-O-Fun, an Israeli version of Boris bikes, available for hire at around \u00a38 for two and a half hours. A network of cycle paths has been established along roads and through parks, and an annual city bike ride attracted 20,000 participants in September (though 42 cyclists were injured). Helmets are encouraged, but not a legal requirement. According to a poll last year, 14% of residents say it&apos;s their main form of transport. But not everyone is in heaven. &quot;A lot of the cycle paths are just painted areas of the pavement, interrupted by bus stops and with pedestrians wandering over them,&quot; says Ruthie Pliskin, a PhD student who cycles to university every day. &quot;Even the paved ones along the roads are often blocked by parked cars. They&apos;re very narrow, and sometimes it&apos;s not even clear which direction you are supposed to cycle.&quot; Despite the city council&apos;s efforts, Pliskin says cycling is still a dangerous activity in Tel Aviv. &quot;But it has the potential to be a great cycling city \u2013 even if you do need eight showers a day in the summer.&quot;Harriet Sherwood Los Angeles Drivers rule Los Angeles, yet on balance the city is surprisingly safe for cycling. An expanding network of bicycle lanes is slowly making parts of LA friendlier to two wheels, turning a once eccentric form of transport almost hip. About two cyclists are killed in traffic-related collisions in LA county each month, out of a total population of 10 million. Per capita, that is a lot better than many other big population centres in the US and elsewhere. The bad news is that 3% of road accident fatalities are cyclists, way above the US&apos;s national figure of 1.7%. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa became evangelical after he fell and broke his arm swerving from a taxi that cut him off on Venice boulevard in 2010. Within two years the city built 123 miles of new bikeways, nearly eight times the rate of the previous 40 years. There are now more than 430 miles of bike paths across the city. Not all cheered. Hollywood complained that a bright green, 6ft-wide lane, which runs for 1.4 miles through downtown&apos;s historic core, ruined the area&apos;s utility as an Anytown, USA, location. Worse, camera lights reflected the green on to everything else, including actors&apos; faces. California&apos;s governor, Jerry Brown, rejected a law obliging motorists to give cyclists at least 3ft of room while passing, or slow down. But advocacy groups such as the LA County Bicycle Coalition, and rider packs known as Midnight Ridazz and Wolfpack Hustle, and programmes such as CicLAvia, appear to be slowly winning the argument. LA&apos;s new mayor, Eric Garcetti, has pledged to continue bike-friendly policies. You still need strong nerves to cycle here. About 22 cyclists a year are killed or badly hurt in LA&apos;s epidemic of hit-and-runs \u2013 there are 20,000 cases annually. Veterans warn that one of the most perilous places is Beverly Hills: few lanes and inconsiderate drivers.Rory Carroll     David Byrne riding his bike in New York. Photograph: Sam Polcer    Why I like cycling in New York CityBy David Byrne I ride everyday in New York City unless it&apos;s pouring rain or snow or the roads are icy \u2013 and that&apos;s actually not often. I\u00a0now know where the protected bike lanes are and I will go a block or two out of my way to use them. The protected ones make a huge difference, though the occasional delivery or municipal vehicle parks in them. Even\u00a0the non-protected lanes \u2013 the ones in green and white paint that run alongside the traffic \u2013 feel much more secure. Having used bikes in London, I&apos;m used to a lack of road space being allocated to cyclists. But it is, yes, a little scary sometimes back in London. We used to do scary quite well in NYC, but we&apos;ve mostly gotten over it. One does have to beware of limo and hire-car drivers who feel they are carrying people more important than us, and watch out for New Jersey plates, as they&apos;ve rarely seen cyclists and pedestrians where they come from. Bike delivery guys riding the wrong way are another hazard, but maybe they&apos;ll fall in line eventually as well. NYC is easy \u2013 it&apos;s dense and fairly flat. The new bike-share program needs to expand and is already hugely popular. I see men in suits using it, so for me that means the whole thing has passed the tipping point and resistance is futile \u2013 best now to figure out how to make it all work. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2013.

There are quite a few candidates. Van Gogh&apos;s Sunflowers, Leonardo da Vinci&apos;s Virgin of the Rocks and Piero della Francesca&apos;s Baptism of Christ all spring to mind \u2013 and that&apos;s just in the National Gallery. Or what about Joseph Wright of Derby&apos;s Orrery, in Derby Museum and Art Gallery? For my money, they are all second best. (Sorry Leonardo). The single greatest painting in a British collection? No question. It is Rembrandt&apos;s Kenwood self-portrait. This majestic work of art is about to go back on permanent public view when Kenwood House in north London reopens its doors on 28 November. It has been closed for repairs and restoration by English Heritage, and if you have been missing it, or have never been, an artistic feast awaits. Kenwood has a staggering art collection, including Gainsborough&apos;s Countess Howe and Turner&apos;s Iveagh Sea-Piece. But the Rembrandt is something else. You don&apos;t have to take my word for it: when Kenwood was closed, this painting was excitedly borrowed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which showed it as one of Rembrandt&apos;s ultimate achievements alongside its own masterpieces by him. Rembrandt, at the age of about 59, looks at us from the depth of his years, and with the authority of his craft. He has portrayed himself holding his brushes, maulstick and palette, in front of two circles drawn on a wall. Why the circles? Do they represent a sketch for a map of the world? Or is Rembrandt alluding, with this drawing on a brown surface, to stories that say the first picture was a drawing made with a stick in sand? His eyes contain so much knowledge and melancholy that even looking at this painting on a computer screen, I get the eerie feeling that Rembrandt is looking back and weighing up my failures. You can deduce the power of the original. He was a failure when he painted this, a proud man reduced to poverty by his enthusiastic spending \u2013 but here he throws it back on the burghers of Amsterdam. Art is not a business; it is a struggle with eternity. Rembrandt stands not proudly or arrogantly, but in the full consciousness of the heroic nature of his work. First there is nothing, then there is a circle. The human hand, guided by the eye and the brain, makes a mark that only we can make \u2013 there are no other geometricians but us, no other animal that can draw or presumably conceive a circle. From the circle to this portrait is another leap. Rembrandt has mapped himself with such craggy truthfulness that we simply stand and look back, wondering if we can ever be as real as he is. This is a supreme work of art, the best we have.", "sentences": ["He was a failure when he painted this, a proud man reduced to poverty by his enthusiastic spending \u2013 but here he throws it back on the burghers of Amsterdam."], "title": "Is this the greatest painting in Britain?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/nov/21/rembrandt-kenwood-self-portrait-best-painting-britain", "tags": ["Rembrandt", "Art and design", "Art", "Painting", "Museums", "Culture", "Exhibitions"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-22T10:12:00Z", "article": "\u2022 Nishtha Chugh\u2022 Meral Duzgun\u2022 Stevie Greenleaf\u2022 Joanna Griffin\u2022 Helen Kearney\u2022 Sophie McBain\u2022 Susie Sell\u2022 Sarah Shearman\u2022 Ben Thurman\u2022 Louise Tickle\u2022 James Wan\u2022 Boel Marcks von W\u00fcrtemberg Nishtha Chugh      Nishtha is a journalist by mission and storyteller by heart.

Memorable moment:The most memorable moment for me was walking into Kibera slum for the first time. We sheltered under the tin roof of a family&apos;s shack as torrential rain beat down, almost drowning out their account of their eight-year-old daughter&apos;s paralysis and epilepsy that meant she couldn&apos;t go to school. The mother breastfed her small baby as she told me of their sadness about their daughter&apos;s situation. The little girl came and sat on my lap. Rubbish and sewage washed along the street just outside as the rain kept coming. I&apos;ve since discovered that Leonard Cheshire Disability International has arranged medical treatment for the girl so that she is now more mobile, less disabled by her epilepsy, and can begin her education again after four years of being virtually unable to leave her home.

McVie wrote Don&apos;t Stop, Songbird and Everywhere, among many others. She has never before expressed regrets about leaving and has spent the past decade living a reclusive life in a 17th-century mansion in Kent. Despite this, she thrilled fans during Fleetwood Mac&apos;s current tour by joining the band for a run-through of Don&apos;t Stop. McVie said playing with the band again was like riding a bike. &quot;It was amazing, like I&apos;d never left. I climbed back on there again and there they were, the same old faces on stage.&quot; Fleetwood Mac are on a tour break after cancelling several Australian and New Zealand dates after news that their bassist, John McVie, has cancer.

But now ambitious underground promoters FACE have scheduled a winter of house and techno favourites at the city&apos;s Rainbow Venues. This weekend, it&apos;s the turn of George FitzGerald (pictured), one of the most eminent UK producers of the last few years, having been present in Berlin when the more fractal end of bass arrived. His own sound has evolved into throwback garage and pulsing, contemporary house. Support comes from funk and disco purveyors Leftfoot, long established favourites of Gilles Petersen. The Rainbow Venues, Sat JT Mister Saturday Night, London New York has already earned its place in clubbing Valhalla, having been the location for David Mancuso&apos;s Loft in the 70s where records were reverently played in full, and The Gallery, where Nicky Siano began mixing them together. These early disco clubs climaxed with Body &amp; Soul in the 90s, after which Giuliani&apos;s theme-parkification of the city dialled down the hedonism when he dug up the ancient and restrictive cabaret laws. But the city&apos;s warehouse party scene is thriving again, partly off the back of a close-knit clutch of underground labels and producers such as LIES and Aurora Halal, and the duo of Mister Saturday Night have become a key player. For four years their itinerant parties have created a non-corporate, DIY space for disco, techno and house, with a label cropping up for tracks by experimental house heads such as Anthony Naples and Dark Sky. You can get a flavour here as the pair, Justin Carter and Eamon Harkin, play one of their increasingly frequent London shows. Dance Tunnel, E8, Sat BB The Guild Of Calamitous Intent, Glasgow Though it&apos;s a city with a diverse palate, Glasgow&apos;s love affair with techno continues to dominate the clubbing landscape. There&apos;s the mainstay prestige of promoters like Pressure, but like all good music-obsessed cities it&apos;s the underground that really speaks to changing tastes and moods. In comes The Guild Of Calamitous Intent, a DIY outfit that&apos;s devoted to a rough-and-ready style that most &quot;big room&quot; techno promoters couldn&apos;t stomach or sell. After bringing Delroy Edwards and Ron Morelli of New York label LIES to sweatbox basements, their next prospect is a live set from US producer Container. Based in Nashville, Tennessee, he&apos;s been impressing the underground with his ambient and noise credentials, and his acclaimed live set is a heady slew of the rawest elements of experimental techno: crunching analogue beats, heavy and hypnotic in their breakneck power.

In reducing road deaths in Britain, let us not forget the 5,000 per annum killed by toxic traffic fumes in London, with the carcinogen PM10 the prime target \u2013 20% of inner London PM10 comes from taxis and nearly 80% from 8,000 buses. To meet air standards means using non-polluting transport such as cycles. The comparison with Amsterdam, which also has narrow streets, is apposite, since trams are the backbone of Amsterdam&apos;s transport. As well as being fume-free, trams don&apos;t kill cyclist, since they stick to their tracks. Plans for supertrams in Southwark could show the way to a central London network and sort out the black spots of Oxford Street and other fume-choked roads. Professor LJS Lesley President of Merseyside Cycling Campaign, Liverpool According to the Department for Transport, more than 540,000 cycling journeys are undertaken in London every day. That&apos;s nearly 200 million a year. A dozen or so fatalities are a tiny proportion of these. Every death is unfortunate, but when cycling is as safe as it is, I have to question Boris Johnson, London&apos;s mayor, spending a billion pounds trying to improve this number. He&apos;s doing it by taking vehicle lanes away and allocating them to cyclists, thus dramatically increasing the overcrowding on roads, which are already close to capacity. This is going to heighten the risks for all road users, including pedestrians, who die at a rate some 600% that of cyclists \u2013 where&apos;s the hand-wringing for them?. Paul Harper London E15 If Johnson really wanted to save cyclists&apos; lives he would be lobbying for a law like that in the Netherlands where, in any collision with a cyclist, the motorist is automatically held to be liable unless they prove otherwise. Is this just British inability to learn anything from the continent or is Boris too scared of losing the motorist vote? George Appleby London NW5 The truth is that, as any road user in central London and other cities will see every day, many cyclists ride unsafely and without much care for anyone else either. &quot;Cycle super-highways&quot; and the like might give cyclists a false sense of safety, but the reality is that paint on a road means little, even if you can see the colour. I used to travel from Swiss Cottage down to the Holborn area via Camden, and in the years I did this had no serious encounters with vehicles. I &quot;rode high&quot;, making sure I was visible at all times; I never went &quot;undertaking&quot; long vehicles (there is a clue in the word, cyclists!) and always wore a helmet. Cyclists have to realise they are the most vulnerable road users, possibly even ahead of pedestrians who, usually, are protected by controlled crossings (when the road users obey the rules!). Or, as my dad used to put it, as a cyclist, they are out to get you and he was a bus driver! Cycle defensively, obey the rules of the road, don&apos;t take risks, wear a crash helmet and don&apos;t expect anyone else to look out for you: it&apos;s your life.

Hazel, the narrator of The Fault in Our Stars, is a cancer survivor. Brave and indomitable, she is an unforgettable character. As is Gus, whose arrival at the Cancer Kids Support Group turns her whole life upside down. Both stay with the reader long after the novel is over. A heart-warming relationship forms between Gus and Hazel. They visit each other&apos;s houses, play games and talk about life. United by their passion for reading they talk a lot about the books they devour and recommend to each other. One of Hazel&apos;s favourite topics is her most-loved book, An Imperial Affliction, by Peter Van Houten. The conclusion of the novel is unresolved, and the two friends talk about that a great deal. Gus goes to the Genies and wishes to go to Amsterdam so that he and Hazel may get the answers to their questions from the author himself. Everyone gets excited and it is decided the Hazel&apos;s mother will accompany Gus and Hazel on the trip. But disaster strikes as Hazel has to be admitted to the ICU. Will the trip to Amsterdam be cancelled? Does Hazel survive? What about Gus? You must read this novel to find out. We follow the novel&apos;s narrator on this roller coaster ride that is at the same time funny, unbearably sad, and deeply brave in the face of impending catastrophe. Green brings alive for us a sense of place. It is almost as if we are there with Hazel and Gus. &quot;But, God it was beautiful, the creek carving a path around a huge tree, a heron standing still at the water&apos;s edge, searching for a breakfast amid the millions of elm petals floating in the water&quot; As a reader who happens to be a girl I was struck by how the author, a man, writes from the point of view of a girl. He fully enters a woman&apos;s state of mind and authentically articulates her impulses and emotions. This absorbing novel, a New York Times bestseller, shows award-winning writer, John Green, at his un-rivalled best. The Fault in Our Stars is a stunning achievement. It is tailor made for the movie that is already being shot. I would rate this book a 10/10! It ought to be at the top of your reading list. Want to tell the world about a book you&apos;ve read?

According to the New York Times, superfans are flocking to America&apos;s eastern seaboard, where an exhibition at the Frick, added to his excellent presence in permanent collections in Washington and New York and a loan at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, means that nearly 40% of his known works can currently be seen in the same region. The Times reports that Vermeer superfans, whom it compares to Wagner enthusiasts, are travelling to America specifically to see this constellation of his works. And why wouldn&apos;t they? Money apart, it&apos;s well worth dedicating yourself to a great artist such as Vermeer. Why should this be thought unusual? People lavish time, funds and effort on cultural activities that are far less rewarding, from football to concerts by ageing rock stars. Vermeer is a profoundly rich and complex artist whose works mirror the living world. He has an enigma at his heart and there are only a limited number of paintings by him extant \u2013 so you can strive to see them all. I may even have done so. I know I&apos;ve seen his paintings in New York, Washington, the Hague, Amsterdam, Vienna, Paris and London. That can&apos;t leave too many I have not seen. And I wouldn&apos;t even say I was a Vermeer superfan. What I am is a Leonardo da Vinci nut. At the height of my obsession with him, I travelled to New York and Paris to see exhibitions of his drawings, repeatedly took the train to France just to see his paintings in the Louvre, talked my way into the Royal Library at Windsor to go through boxes of his notes, and made pilgrimage upon pilgrimage to Florence. The lovely thing about Leonardo is that you don&apos;t have to spend this much time and money to find him rewarding. His art reproduces easily and his notebooks can be read anywhere in paperback. After blowing all my money on the travels described above, I just sat down with some picture books and found Leonardo even more mesmerising. But I think it is worth being a slave to art. Some artists just get their hooks in you and ask you to find out more about them. You feel utterly compelled to track down their masterpieces \u2013 reproductions will not do. As well as doting on Leonardo, I confess to being a Michelangelo and Caravaggio groupie. I have made it my business to see the almost complete works of Michelangelo \u2013 his Madonna in Bruges is the only one of his sculptures I have still not seen face to face \u2013 and I have taken a trip in search of every painting by Caravaggio. It doesn&apos;t pass, this addiction. I&apos;ve seen all of Caravaggio&apos;s paintings in Italy but last summer, in Rome, it suddenly hit me that I had to see his picture of St Peter in Santa Maria del Popolo, immediately, and I dragged my family across the city, way off course, in the hot afternoon. We&apos;d already seen three Caravaggios that day \u2013 why did I need another? I just did. Great art is deeply compelling. It makes groupies of us if we let it. And it is truly worth the effort, so why not? I don&apos;t think the people making a pilgrimage to the Frick&apos;s Vermeer exhibition are eccentrics. I think they are true art lovers.", "sentences": ["I know I&apos;ve seen his paintings in New York, Washington, the Hague, Amsterdam, Vienna, Paris and London."], "title": "Only here for Vermeer: the rise of fine art groupies", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/nov/28/vermeer-new-york-frick-exhibition-groupies", "tags": ["Johannes Vermeer", "Leonardo da Vinci", "Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio", "Exhibitions", "Art", "Painting", "Culture", "US news", "New York"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-28T19:53:53Z", "article": "It&apos;s easy to get a sense of how the locals in Natal \u2013 one of the venues for next year&apos;s football World Cup \u2013 feel about the tournament. &quot;What&apos;s the new stadium like?&quot; I ask a customs officer, in the arrivals hall of the city&apos;s airport. &quot;It must be almost built by now.&quot; The officer stamps my passport and looks up. &quot;A spacecraft,&quot; she says, deadpan. &quot;It&apos;s like a spacecraft has crash-landed in the middle of our town.&quot; Few have heard of Natal, in Brazil&apos;s far north-east tip. Think Rio de Janeiro without the bikinis and beach joggers. But if it is unknown now, it won&apos;t be by June 2014: Natal is one of 12 host cities for next summer&apos;s tournament. Rumour has it that England could be playing here in the group stages. The Arena das Dunas \u2013 named after the sand dunes on the nearby coast \u2013 looms into view on the drive from the\u00a0airport. The start of the World Cup is less than seven months away. But there is little pre-tournament excitement here so far. Resentment is more prevalent. Jan-Marten Hoitsma, project manager at AFC Ajax&apos;s Amsterdam Arena, who was drafted in a few months ago to help see the Natal stadium project to completion, has an explanation: &quot;There are no big football teams here \u2013 the biggest team gets gates of around 5,000 and we&apos;re building a 42,000-seater World Cup stadium.&quot; The locals are unhappy about the costs, so he and his team are trying to encourage young people from the poorer neighbourhoods of Natal to train as World Cup stewards. &quot;We need to win over the community,&quot; he admits. A football stadium already existed on the site where the new one is being built, but it didn&apos;t meet Fifa standards. It&apos;s a familiar story across the 12 host cities; old stadiums being bulldozed to make way for shiny new ones costing tens of millions of pounds. &quot;We want &apos;Fifa standard&apos; hospitals and schools&quot; is a popular jibe in graffiti across the city. Outside the entrance to Arena das Dunas, someone has scrawled a new message: &quot;We want &apos;Fifa standard&apos; work.&quot; Investment in World Cup projects \u2013 including stadiums, airports, roads and public transport \u2013 is expected to generate \u00a355bn for the Brazilian economy by 2019, according to the Brazilian ministry of sport. But the building projects have spiralled disastrously over-budget. Spending on the renovation and construction of football grounds was supposed to come in at less than \u00a3600m, but has climbed to more than four times that amount already. The petal-patterned roof structure of the Arena das Dunas looks far more impressive from the inside. Hoitsma says around 1,900 construction workers are employed on the site. Most are on minimum-wage salaries, but many have asked for pay rises and recently downed tools in protest. At Natal&apos;s local government building, a stone&apos;s throw from the ground, there are bullet holes in the door from a robbery the week before. No one has bothered to fix the damage yet. An empty safe sits upturned in the hallway. Natal once enjoyed a reputation for being one of the safest cities in Brazil. But, like the rest of the country, the region&apos;s rapid economic growth of the past 10 years has stalled recently and crime has been edging up. Rogerio Marinho, economic secretary for the region, tells me around R$400m (\u00a3105m) been spent so far on building Natal&apos;s stadium. Compared with Wembley that is not a huge sum \u2013 but Natal is a city of fewer than 1m people and is short of about 40,000 homes. There&apos;s a desperate need for affordable places to live. People often live 10 to a house. Statistics like those led to 30,000 demonstrators piling on to Natal&apos;s streets over the summer to protest over poor public services at a time when so much money is being spent on a stadium to host just four World Cup matches. Similar protests took place in more than 100 cities across Brazil. &quot;When the World Cup came to Natal, we felt as if we&apos;d won a huge prize,&quot; Marinho says. &quot;The federal government had a specific plan for every city. We were going to get better streets, better public transport, all sorts of benefits.&quot; He admits: &quot;Most of those projects will not be ready in time.&quot; World Cup-fuelled tourism is one of the big hopes; Fifa has already received over 6 million ticket requests. But in the last World Cup, in South Africa, only 300,000 foreign football fans visited \u2013 around a third less than expected. Another hope for Natal is the new airport that is being hurriedly finished. Marinho hopes it will be a boost for the local economy, given the ambition to make it the largest airport in Latin America \u2013 and one of the biggest in the\u00a0world. They hope it will become a mega hub like Atlanta in the United States, a place that millions of people pass through but few stay in. That transience, perhaps, sums up the destiny of Natal&apos;s new World Cup stadium too.", "sentences": ["Jan-Marten Hoitsma, project manager at AFC Ajax&apos;s Amsterdam Arena, who was drafted in a few months ago to help see the Natal stadium project to completion, has an explanation: &quot;There are no big football teams here \u2013 the biggest team gets gates of around 5,000 and we&apos;re building a 42,000-seater World Cup stadium.&quot; The locals are unhappy about the costs, so he and his team are trying to encourage young people from the poorer neighbourhoods of Natal to train as World Cup stewards."], "title": "Brazil World Cup host city Natal seethes at cost", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/28/brazil-world-cup-natal-cost", "tags": ["Brazil", "World Cup 2014", "Americas", "World Cup", "World news", "Football", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-29T16:53:53Z", "article": "A Nigerian university student wakes up with her middle-aged sugar daddy one morning and suggests that they start using condoms. &quot;Baby,&quot; the man croons smoothly, before brushing off her concerns with a Yoruba phrase that translates roughly as &quot;an orange is not savoured with its peel on&quot;. When the university student \u2013 who lives off handouts from multiple sexual partners \u2013 confronts him after discovering he is HIV positive, he tries to appease her with a shopping trip to Dubai. The scenes are being played out by actors, but activists say Shuga, a gritty sex and relationships TV drama, is reaching young people in a way traditional Aids campaigns have rarely done. For decades, attempts to curb HIV in Africa have either focused on medical solutions or behavioural changes \u2013 normally tied in with Christian-based abstinence messages. That has rarely worked in the continent&apos;s countries which have borne the brunt of a 30-year epidemic. Now the producers behind Shuga, which has aired for two hugely successful seasons in Kenya, have shifted the drama to Lagos in the hope of tapping Africa&apos;s most populous country \u2013 and the continent&apos;s movie powerhouse. The show premiered to rave reviews this week at a Lagos event studded with Nollywood stars, Afrobeats luminaries and some of the ordinary Nigerians who shine in the series. &quot;The issues are so real, but people can relate because it&apos;s not preachy or trying to change society,&quot; said Maria Okanrende, a DJ who plays a student trying to break into the music industry as an ex-boyfriend waltzes back into her life. &quot;A lot of people are not going to like its rawness, but if you&apos;re watching it, you&apos;re going to talk afterwards. Everybody knows someone like my character.&quot; The producers believe it is that ordinariness which appeals to young people, among whom Aids-related deaths have soared even while they fall within the general population, as the World Health Organisation reported this week. &quot;My 15 year-old hates it when I say this, but my belief is that in order to conquer HIV we really need to talk more about sex,&quot; Georgia Arnold, of MTV&apos;s Staying Alive Foundation, which has backed the series, said as clusters of teenagers tried to sneak into the star-studded event. When she repeated that message later in front of a packed cinema audience, a nervous murmur ran through the crowd. But as the lights dimmed, it was clear just how much they were drawn by the painfully realistic depictions of campus life: the booze-fuelled mishaps with exes, wayward visiting younger sisters, friends in abusive relationships and the room-mate with an unwelcome live-in girlfriend. The crowd roared with appreciative laughter when one character, at an HIV testing centre, struggled to remember how many sexual partners she had had, furtively counting on her fingers under the table. Eventually she asks the unimpressed counsellor: &quot;This year?&quot; Fighting an epidemic With around 3.3 million patients, Nigeria&apos;s HIV rate is second only to South Africa globally. But in an often deeply religious and conservative society, social taboos about discussing sex mean up to 80% of people don&apos;t know their HIV status. &quot;When you talk to people about HIV in Nigeria, they say: &apos;We really don&apos;t have that problem here&apos;,&quot; said Biyi Bandele, one of the show&apos;s writers, best known for directing the hit film Half of a Yellow Sun. He said research trips to clinics had been an eye-opener. &quot;There were people you would never guess had Aids queuing up, literally everybody you could ever meet. My hope is that this story will go into living rooms, and families will discuss it across whole generations.&quot; There is evidence that initiatives such as Shuga are already doing that. When South African health professor James Lees saw the first series screened in Amsterdam, he was gobsmacked: &quot;At the end of it, I felt completely emotionally wrung out. I&apos;d been waiting for this series for 20 years.&quot; Lee said he had since handed out thousands of copies of the film to community health workers and teachers. A study this year found watching the series produced dramatic results in both awareness and willingness to talk about the disease among Lee&apos;s pupils \u2013 a breakthrough in a country where discussions around Aids are emotionally charged. &quot;What a lot of people sitting at their desks in Geneva or Brussels don&apos;t understand is that in the middle of an epidemic is a lot of trauma. When you have watched two, three, four loved ones, even the guy at the post office, go through incredibly painful deaths, would you be able to talk about it? Ironically,many teachers have vast personal experiences of HIV within their families, [but] most have been unable to bring that experience to their classrooms.&quot; Lees said he hoped the next series would be set in South Africa. For now, many of Shuga&apos;s Nigerian fans say the series has raised a crucial bar in the country&apos;s film industry. &quot;That kind of quality and social lifestyle it discusses is really important because Nigerian films have a way of catching fire online \u2013 you have people from London to Rio to Houston who are going to be watching this,&quot; said one enthusiast at the Lagos screening. For Treasure Uchegbu, whose on-screen role as an Aids counsellor mirrors her real profession, filming was so realistic it brought back memories of one of her most heart-breaking experiences. &quot;There was a 22-year-old who had never had sex; never done drugs. She fainted when we told her she was positive. But immediately before the test she had told me the place where she got one very small tattoo done, and I just knew what I was going to [have to] tell her.&quot; As night approached, Treasure left the after-party to prepare for a 6am start at her mobile testing clinic.", "sentences": ["When South African health professor James Lees saw the first series screened in Amsterdam, he was gobsmacked: &quot;At the end of it, I felt completely emotionally wrung out."], "title": "Shuga: the soap opera helping Africa confront HIV", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/29/soap-opera-nigeria-hiv-problem-tv-shuga-sex", "tags": ["Aids and HIV", "Nigeria", "Africa", "World news", "Society", "Television", "Culture", "Television & radio", "Health", "Sex education", "Sexual health", "South Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-11-30T00:18:00Z", "article": "Sam Allardyce has told his West Ham players that they must stick together for the start of what he believes is a defining period for his side. West Ham have slipped down the table and the\u00a0manager feels that team spirit will be vital as they look to pull themselves away from danger. West Ham have been boosted by the news that Andy Carroll will return to training next week as he continues his recovery from his heel injury, although Allardyce said that the 24-year-old may not be available for selection before January. A more immediate concern is the visit of Fulham to Upton Park on Saturday and the trip to Crystal Palace on Tuesday, with Allardyce saying that picking up six points against their fellow strugglers could transform West Ham&apos;s fortunes. Only goal difference is keeping West Ham above Fulham, whose manager, Martin Jol, is also under pressure after five successive defeats in all competitions, and out of the bottom three after two wins in their first 12 matches. Allardyce, who said that he has not spoken to the club&apos;s co-owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, about his future, was the subject of fierce criticism from fans during last Saturday&apos;s 3-0 home defeat by Chelsea. He made a double substitution after 40 minutes and Joe Cole stormed down the tunnel after being removed. Cole, who is out of contract at the end of the season, remains happy at the club but Allardyce stressed the need for his players to be professional, while accepting the midfielder&apos;s frustration. &quot;It&apos;s a difficult period but players show their true team spirit in situations like this,&quot; he said. &quot;They show their true togetherness and that&apos;s what they&apos;ve got to do, they&apos;ve got to stick together. They can&apos;t fragment and think it&apos;s all about them. It&apos;s not just about them, it&apos;s about the whole team and everything that goes with it to achieve the right results.&quot; West Ham have been blunt in the absence of Carroll, scoring nine goals. The striker, who signed for \u00a315m from Liverpool in the summer, has been undergoing treatment in Amsterdam as part of his rehabilitation and his return to London is imminent, but Allardyce does not want to rush him back into the first team. &quot;It&apos;s tentative in terms of your approach,&quot; Allardyce said. &quot;You can&apos;t get over-anxious and push him too hard. We can&apos;t do anything other than what the specialists are saying, no matter how desperate our situation may become. We have to get him fit to stay fit. &quot;We&apos;ll have to make an assessment when he is back with us. When we can monitor him on a day-to-day basis we can make that judgment. Having not played a game since May, it will take a bit of time to get into a match-fitness situation. It&apos;s up to us to alleviate that as quickly as possible.&quot; West Ham have struggled to cope without Carroll. Allardyce has used a strikerless formation in the past six matches, a tactic which has worked less well since its first outing in the 3-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur, but suggested he may dispense with that system against Fulham. However, Modibo Ma\u00efga has not scored for a year, Mladen Petric has a calf injury and Carlton Cole has not been deemed fit enough to start a league match since rejoining the club last month. One thing Allardyce insists he will not do is drop his captain, Kevin Nolan, even though the midfielder has not scored since the opening day of the season. Nolan, who has played further forward in the past three matches, was West Ham&apos;s leading goalscorer with 10 goals last season but has struggled to recapture that form. &quot;He drives our players on,&quot; Allardyce said. &quot;When you&apos;re in this position and you&apos;re not scoring goals, then to leave out your leading goalscorer from last year, you&apos;re going to take away something in the team that could possibly finish off a chance even though he&apos;s having a dry spell.&quot; Allardyce said that he saw fear creeping into his players&apos; game after the defeat by Chelsea but hopes that can be used as an advantage. &quot;You accept it in its entirety to use it as a positive and make you go out with the desire to give your all,&quot; he said. &quot;When that happens, you stick to the principles of the game you know are the best for you. You stick to your strengths and don&apos;t try to do anything out of the ordinary that&apos;s not comfortable for you.&quot; Jol has admitted he fears for his job if his team fail to win Saturday&apos;s derby or that at home to Spurs on Wednesday. &quot;If I was on the board or an owner I would be worrying,&quot; he said. &quot;We need wins. Every game is almost a must-win game.&quot; Asked if he believed his position was safe, Jol said: &quot;If we win, yeah. If we don&apos;t, I don&apos;t know.

Grim fare, you might think, and wholly unsuitable for children. Yet this hilarious, honest and beautifully rendered play, a Belvoir/Theatre of Image production now on at the Melbourne Theatre Company, is exemplary children&apos;s theatre. The children crowded into the auditorium on opening night loved it. I walked out with my heart singing, hope temporarily restored for the human race. Richard Tulloch&apos;s sensitive adaptation, directed by Neil Armfield, is excellent theatre by any standards. It&apos;s based on a book by one of the Netherlands&apos;s most popular children&apos;s authors, Guus Kuijer. Yet its dark themes makes it the sort of work that causes handwringing. Writing for young people is a regular magnet for moral panic. Only last weekend there was an article warning of the &quot;dangers&quot; of so-called &quot;sicklit&quot;, a glib moniker for young adult books that explore the darker realities of contemporary society. What is most concerning, it seems, is that young people enjoy reading them. Teens, who are seldom asked for their opinions, claim these books help them to survive; they make them feel less alone, and give them hope and courage. Children are no more protected from dark realities than adults \u2013 they suffer poverty, disadvantage and violence, just as their parents do. And anyone who thinks tackling hard themes is incompatible with joy should have a look at The Book of Everything. Thomas Klopper (Matthew Whittet), who is &quot;nine \u2026 almost ten&quot;, lives with his father (Peter Carroll), mother (Claire Jones) and sister Margot (Alison Bell). His Aunty Pie (Genevieve Picot) lives down the road. He sees things nobody else sees: hailstorms in the middle of summer and tropical fish in the Amsterdam canals. He is regularly beaten by his father for these imaginative oddities \u2013 but it is his father hitting his mother that distresses him more. Most importantly, Thomas has a kind heart. It leads him to make friends with the witch next door, Mrs Van Amersfoort (Julie Forsyth), who turns out to be a survivor of the resistance against the Nazis, and to write a letter to his 16-year-old crush Eliza (Andrea Demetriades): &quot;Dear Eliza, maybe you think you&apos;re not pretty because you&apos;ve got a leather leg that creaks when you walk but you are the most beautiful girl in the world.&quot; And when God disappears, Thomas is visited by the chatty Lord Jesus (John Leary), who also has problems with his father. It&apos;s a dream cast, with Whittet&apos;s charmingly awkward nearly-10-year-old at the centre of a glowing ensemble. Armfield&apos;s rough theatre production is enchanting, reflecting the magical surreality of Kuijer&apos;s story. Kim Carpenter&apos;s design is a giant book, its pages turned by the cast to create the backdrops for different scenes. Steve Francis&apos;s sound design is created on stage by actors seated to the side, against Iain Grandage&apos;s live piano and cello music. In The Book of Everything, the generosities of imagination and love are pitted against ignorance, oppression and fear. It&apos;s a story about being brave and making friends, about being big enough to see that those who are abusive are human too, and ultimately dishonour only themselves. And it deftly avoids patronising its audience, or any Pollyanna-ish glossing of the complexities it raises. Highly recommended, for children of nine years and over. \u2022 The Book of Everything runs until December 22", "sentences": ["He sees things nobody else sees: hailstorms in the middle of summer and tropical fish in the Amsterdam canals."], "title": "The Book of Everything \u2014 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/australia-culture-blog/2013/dec/02/mtc-book-of-everything-review", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-02T16:04:39Z", "article": "Peter Kaplan, who died on Friday at 59, of cancer, was an editor whose career spanned and encapsulated what one of his many employees and prot\u00e9g\u00e9es \u2013 John Homans now at New York Magazine \u2013 calls the &quot;late Renaissance&quot; of American journalism. It is a career mainly associated with the New York Observer, which he edited for 15 years, but one that also tells a larger story of how the world turned in New York publishing.  Kaplan came to the city from Harvard in 1976, when print \u2013 newspapers, books, magazines \u2013 was arguably the most influential business in the city. Time, Inc was Google. Ivy League editors were princes among the mighty. He went to work at New Times, a bi-weekly feature news magazine, launched a few years before by Jon Larsen (whose father was of the Time, Inc elite) and George Hirsch, a former publisher of New York Magazine, from which all other magazines of the period descended. New York was started by Clay Felker, who all editors aspired to be. (New York, after 45 years as a weekly, has just announced that it is scaling down to a biweekly schedule.) Single title magazine companies seemed like a reasonable model and could be found all over town \u2013 or, as it were, midtown. Who didn&apos;t want to be in publishing? In 1976, Rupert Murdoch launched a successful hostile takeover of New York Magazine, which also got him its sister publication the Village Voice, which, at the time, had a per-line classified advertising rate higher than any other in the world. In 1982, Bill Ziff, who owned a stable of hobby and trade magazines, one floor up from New Times, sold his titles for $1bn (half of them to Murdoch, the other have to CBS because even television networks wanted to be in publishing), making magazines an official gold mine.  Alas, New Times, which lasted through the 1970s, closed because its general interest topical subject matter was not as attractive to advertisers as the new &quot;targeted&quot; subject matter. Indeed, New Times sister publication, the Runner, about the new running craze, was sold to Ziff, its upstairs neighbor and included in the billion dollar sale. (Ziff went on to build yet another billionaire dollar publishing company around computer magazines.) After Felker had been forced out of New York Magazine, he bought Esquire, where Kaplan was next hired. Esquire, the dominant magazine journalism title of the 1960s, had began to ail in the 1970s, in part because the men&apos;s publishing category had become so over-crowded. Men, who currently represent a minuscule publishing audience, were then the most attractive and profitable demographic in the industry. Felker&apos;s Esquire, expanded and renamed Esquire Fortnightly, quickly faltered, and had to be rescued by Chris Whittle, a small-time out-of-town publisher, who rode a revived, if dumbed down and advertiser friendly, version of Esquire to instant power in New York. Kaplan, who had an unhappy segue at the New York Times Magazine, went on to become the number two editor at Manhattan, Inc, a business magazine in the style of New York Magazine, launched in 1984 by Herbert Lipson, a publisher from Philadelphia, and edited by Jane Amsterdam who had worked with Kaplan at New Times \u2013 and, who, in the tight knit, incestuous, and Kremlin-like New York publishing world, married (and later acrimoniously divorced) New Times founder and, subsequently, Village Voice editor Jon Larsen. Manhattan, Inc, covering the new money of the 80s, and, in almost sporting fashion, the rise of the exaggerated figures on Wall Street, was, briefly, the hottest spot in New York journalism life. Indeed, 1985 marked the high point of revenues in the magazine industry. It was all downhill from there, but no one knew it yet.  In 1987, the stock market crashed causing turmoil between Lipson and his editors and, in short order, the exit of Amsterdam and Kaplan. Felker would return briefly to take their place, before Manhattan, Inc closed, along with the decade. Kaplan, who returned again unhappily to the New York Times, began trying to create and raise money for his own magazine \u2013 a new, sophisticated men&apos;s title. Smart Magazine, another sophisticated men&apos;s title, had just recently been launched by Terry McDonell, a former Rolling Stone editor, with backing from Psychology Today publisher and high flying magazine entrepreneur Owen Lipstein. But when Esquire, beginning to see a drop in the market, sold itself to the Hearst Corporation, McDonell was hired to take over and Kaplan was handed Smart. But this was 1990, and the recession that year caused a sudden retrenchment of consumer advertising spending with print suffering more than all other media. It was an inflection point from which began the great decline in print advertising. And it trapped Kaplan at a magazine that could not afford to publish \u2013 or even clean its offices (a bad fix for the disorganized and messy Kaplan). But then in a seismic reshuffling, Tina Brown left Vanity Fair to edit the New Yorker (bought in 1985, in its last profitable year, by Conde Nast), and Graydon Carter, who had gone to edit the New York Observer after the collapse of Spy Magazine, which he founded, went to Vanity Fair, leaving the Observer to Kaplan. The Observer, a weekly newspaper on Manhattan&apos;s Upper East Side, was an odd fish publication started by the Wall Street financier Arthur Carter, an odd fish publisher. If it ever had a hope of making money, this passed quickly and it became merely a rich man&apos;s indulgence, though never a terribly extravagant one. A shoe-string indulgence.  Its first iteration was as a small town newspaper in New York, modeled after a similar paper Carter owned in Connecticut&apos;s Litchfield Country. Then Graydon Carter (no relation), taking from his Spy experience, and ever influenced by New York Magazine, turned it into the model of reporting on powerful people in business and media \u2013 that was the newspaper Kaplan took over. Carter (Graydon) never got along with Carter (Arthur). But Kaplan did. Kaplan seemed to understand, earlier than most, a new reality about publishing. You had to lower your expectations. It was as though Kaplan, by then having endured so many of publishing&apos;s dashed hopes and dreams, was satisfied having no horizons beyond staying within the losses that Carter would support. Ever tempted, he nonetheless rebuffed (mostly) any interest by larger titles or, later, by new digital enterprises. He tended what he called &quot;my little newspaper&quot;. And, for quite some time, his hunkered down or even ostrich-like approach was an effective publishing model. Employing the young and inexpensive, or the old and over-the-hill \u2013 and being himself satisfied with a modest living \u2013 he was able to put out a weekly publication with heart and imagination. Its influence, as has often been noted, was much greater than its size, but, with a real readership in the tens of thousands, that might not be saying much. But it knew its break even (well, sometimes break even) place. And still, this was not enough. In 2006, Arthur Carter sold the paper to 25-year-old Jared Kushner, a rich man&apos;s son, who Kaplan, now middle aged, had little patience for, finally leaving the paper in 2009. Since then, the Kaplan legend, casting him as the last of a breed, has only grown, helped by a set of Twitter homages engaged in some ultimate ironic projection of Kaplan into a world that was wholly foreign to him, and by the reverence of the many people he trained, a downwardly mobile generation of journalists who now populate the internet.

The production, a revival of a previous touring show, will restart life with a run at the South Bank venue before its first international stop in Amsterdam. Over the course of 2014, Hamlet will make 70 stops at venues including the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC, an outdoor theatre in the rainforest in St Lucia and Roman theatres in Bulgaria and Macedonia. If that project seems like a harmonious exercise in border-hopping, the Globe&apos;s new season at home will be the opposite, focusing on the conflict between nations. Artistic director Dominic Dromgoole announced a summer season of Shakespeare plays and new writing about war under the banner title Arms and the Man. There is a distinctly Roman edge to the Globe&apos;s 2014 programming, with a new production of Antony and Cleopatra lining up alongside Dromgoole&apos;s own staging of Julius Caesar and a revamped revival for Lucy Bailey&apos;s bloody Titus Andronicus \u2013 a production that reportedly caused audience members to faint in 2006. The Shakespearean element of the season will be completed by a new production of The Comedy of Errors directed by Blanche McIntyre. However, it is the Globe&apos;s continued determination to produce new writing for the historical venue that stands out with playwrights Richard Bean, Howard Brenton and David Eldridge contributing new plays alongside the poet Simon Armitage. Each of the four plays will focus on a different war from history. Brenton&apos;s play, entitled Doctor Scroggy&apos;s War, will mark the centenary of the first world war with a narrative that follows a 19-year-old soldier to the trenches and his subsequent relationship with the pioneering plastic surgeon Harold Gillies. Elridge will look at the history of Jerusalem in Holy Warriors, a play that takes a wide-angle view stretching from the Roman conquest to today&apos;s conflict via the crusades. Elsewhere Bean&apos;s play Pitcairn, a collaboration with Max Stafford-Clark&apos;s company Out of Joint, will consider colonialism, and Armitage will dramatise the end of the Trojan siege in The Last Days of Troy. Some eyebrows have been raised by the fact that the new Globe season does not feature a play by a female writer, at a time when there is renewed scrutiny of the historical gender imbalance in British theatre. Dromgoole admitted that &quot;more should be done, will be done&quot;, but insisted the Globe wasn&apos;t neglecting its duties. &quot;We have female playwrights under commission, are discussing already written plays by female playwrights and are hoping to make the Globe available for them in the future,&quot; he said. The season will crown a busy period for the Globe. A new indoor space, the candlelit Sam Wanamaker theatre, will open in January, and the following month the theatre will complete its first Broadway run for the double-bill of Twelfth Night and Richard III starring Mark Rylance, which has just announced a two-week extension until 16 February 2014.", "sentences": ["The production, a revival of a previous touring show, will restart life with a run at the South Bank venue before its first international stop in Amsterdam."], "title": "Shakespeare's Globe theatre announces 2014 season and Hamlet world tour", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/dec/05/shakespeares-globe-theatre-2014-season-hamlet", "tags": ["Shakespeare's Globe", "Theatre", "Richard Bean", "Howard Brenton", "Stage", "William Shakespeare", "Culture", "Simon Armitage", "Books"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-06T00:28:50Z", "article": "Last week I took a nine year old and ten year old to see Melbourne Theatre Company\u2019s production of The Book Of Everything and had one of those rare transcendent experiences you can only get from excellent theatre. It reminded me why I pay and take my kids hoping they don\u2019t suffer the kind of BTT (Bad Theatre Trauma) that turns people off what should be a great experience; we\u2019re all made of stories, and stories are made of us. And yet I hate theatre. I blame having to go to mass for an hour every Sunday for the first 18 years of my life. That\u2019s enough to turn a young feminist off sitting still and watching people prance around on stage. Watching the passionless priest drone on with his incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo made me want to get up on stage and tear the place a new one. And the set was woeful. From when my sons were very young I have taken them to a heap of performances. But the more these performances were labelled \u201ckids\u201d theatre/art/comedy/music the more the children and I hated them. Our experience is of theatre that is often condescending, lazy and underestimates the capacity and desire of kids to understand and appreciate complex, nuanced and confronting subject matter. So instead of childrens\u2019 theatre, I usually take my kids to stuff I think they\u2019ll enjoy, rather than things directly marketed at kids. Comedy is always a winner, so too stuff like Circus Oz and Chunky Move. The List Operators buck the trend for kids stuff being crap. I went to The Book Of Everything because people said it was fabulous and the cast looked awesome and \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 Neil Armfield was directing. I checked and saw there was an interval, handy for if we needed to bale. We didn\u2019t. The show was a deeply moving, very funny and emotionally satisfying. What makes this more surprising is The Book Of Everything deals with domestic violence, child abuse and because it\u2019s set in postwar Amsterdam, in the emotional aftermath of the Nazis. Strong female characters were not the exception but the majority of the cast. The writing and performances were superb, the show thoroughly and expertly rehearsed and directed. This is not my usual experience of \u201ckids theatre\u201d. Take away the lazy scripts, pantomime acting, rudderless direction, pointless masks, over the top costumes, annoying music, intrusive audience participation \u2013 which is mostly a cop-out for lack of plot, character and performance \u2013 and all you have is an ice-cream on the way home. As we wandered home past the National Gallery of Victoria, and the boys and I ran our fingers along the water wall, I felt like a ten year old myself. I was overwhelmed by the floaty transcendent feeling I\u2019d experienced as a little girl after art had explained something to me. Theatre is at its best when it\u2019s not obsessed with \u201cfeel good\u201d but aims more at \u201cfeel something\u201d.

While families exchange presents and eat cakes to welcome Santa Claus&apos;s slimmer and more sober ancestor, criticism of the crude depictions of his sidekick, known locally as Zwarte Piet, has reached the United Nations. The clown is usually portrayed by a white person in blackface, who goes around offering sweets to good children and, according to legend, threatens to collect naughty ones in a sack to be taken to Zwarte Piet&apos;s home in Spain. But he is increasingly reviled by critics as a racist relic of Christmases past. Momentum has been growing against the custom, in part thanks to campaigners such as Quinsy Gario, a poet and activist born in the former Dutch colony of Cura\u00e7ao who was arrested two years ago for wearing a T-shirt with the slogan &quot;Black Pete is racism&quot; at a Saint Nicholas parade in the city of Dordrecht. Gario&apos;s message is that the tradition perpetuates crude stereotypes. In October a United Nations adviser on minority rights described Black Pete as &quot;a throwback to slavery&quot;. Verene Shepherd, a Jamaican academic who chairs the UN working group of experts on people of African descent, said on Dutch TV: &quot;As a black person, I feel that if I were living in the Netherlands, I would object to it.&quot; Shepherd&apos;s intervention prompted an indignant reaction on Facebook from Black Pete&apos;s defenders. A Facebook &quot;Pietitie&quot; (Pete-ition) defending the custom earned more than two million likes, a startling number for a country of just 17 million. The populist anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders said it would be better to scrap the UN than Black Pete. Both the prime minister, Mark Rutte, and the mayor of Amsterdam, Eberhard van der Laan, offered carefully worded statements of support. The criticisms have provoked debate about identity and image within the Netherlands, which prides itself on tolerance and social harmony. Peter Jan Margry, a researcher at the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam, said: &quot;For too long, we have seen ourselves as a less racist society, and never thought that the comical Black Pete figure could be offensive.&quot; Most Dutch remain stubbornly attached to the custom. An October opinion poll revealed that 91% of Dutch did not want to change the tradition to placate the country&apos;s ethnic minorities. In Breda, just north of the Belgian border, Black Pete features as dolls in shop windows, as gingerbread cakes, and in parades alongside Saint Nicholas. Most of the locals say it is an innocent family tradition, hammered by political correctness. &quot;I don&apos;t see why this is offensive: he&apos;s friendly and fun,&quot; says Dirk Bakker, a taxi driver. Sophie de Vries, a caf\u00e9 barrista, claims the criticism misses the point: &quot;Some say he is a black man, but I was always told that his face was simply dirty because he climbed down the chimney,&quot; she says. Even Edgar Pelkmans, a student from the former Dutch colony of Surinam, said the practice was harmless: &quot;I&apos;m not that offended: he&apos;s like one of Santa&apos;s elves.&quot; However, the tone appears to have changed. In the recent Amsterdam parade for Saint Nicholas, Black Pete&apos;s big hoop earrings were deliberately sacrificed, and there were even portrayals of him in colours other than black. &quot;There is a more pronounced sense of cultural embarrassment now,&quot; says James Kennedy, an American historian at the University of Amsterdam, who sees this as a turning point. &quot;Although many Dutch see themselves as beyond racism, and insist no offence is intended, there is a definite trend against Black Pete.

Thousands of passengers were affected by the glitch at the National Air Traffic Services&apos; (Nats) control centre in Swanwick, Hampshire \u2013 which deals with air traffic in the south of England. A fifth of all flights were cancelled at Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick airports while others faced delays of up to two hours. &quot;The problem that arose this morning with the ground communications system in the area control operations room at Nats Swanwick has now been resolved and operations are returning to normal,&quot; a Nats spokesman said shortly after 7.30pm. &quot;The technical and operational contingency measures we have had in place all day have enabled us to deliver more than 80% of our normal operation.&quot; Luton, Southampton, London City, Cardiff, Bristol, Bournemouth, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dublin airports also reported delays. The spokesman said Nats regretted the disruption caused but insisted that passenger safety had not been compromised. He said problems arose during a switch from night to daytime operations, when communication systems failed to adjust. &quot;To be clear, this is a very complex and sophisticated system with more than a million lines of software. This is not simply internal telephones, it is the system that controllers use to speak to other [air traffic control] agencies both in the UK and Europe and is the biggest system of its kind in Europe. &quot;This has been a major challenge for our engineering team and for the manufacturer, who has worked closely with us to ensure this complex problem was resolved as quickly as possible while maintaining a safe service.&quot; Although the problem was fixed on Saturday evening, disruption was expected to continue as airports worked to clear the backlog. The Airport Operators&apos; Association said travellers should contact their airline directly for flight information. Passengers at Heathrow airport, Europe&apos;s busiest, suffered delays of more than an hour on many morning departures, and several dozen short-haul flights to destinations including Nice, Milan and Istanbul were cancelled. &quot;We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to our flights, but there will inevitably be a number of short-haul cancellations at some UK and European airports,&quot; she said. &quot;Given that Heathrow is the world&apos;s busiest two-runway airport and Gatwick is the world&apos;s busiest single-runway airport, there will be problems for all airlines.&quot; A spokeswoman for Gatwick airport said 20% of its flights had faced delays of up to two hours. A Stansted airport spokesman said all of its departing flights had been subject to delays of between 30 minutes and two hours, while Gatwick airport said 20% of its departures had been delayed, with passengers warned they could have to wait &quot;a couple of hours&quot;. On its website, Ryanair apologised for any inconvenience: &quot;Ryanair has been advised of an equipment failure within UK air traffic control which will cause significant flight delays and possible cancellations.&quot; Chris Yates, an aviation expert said that it would be a difficult day for anyone flying on Saturday. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a day of frustrations and the knock-on effects are going to last for the whole day because of the backlog of planes,&quot; he said. Yates said Swanwick controls all aircraft over the South of England, meaning thousands of passengers would be affected. &quot;There are contingency plans in place whenever this happens,&quot; he said. &quot;Many of the long-haul flights, coming from China, India, the US and so on, passengers sitting on those planes may find themselves diverted to continental airports. &quot;But it&apos;s going to be a long wait for them. When the system kicks back in and starts working, there will be a backlog of flights. &quot;For those waiting to fly out, it&apos;s going to be a case of sitting around the airport terminal until things get back to normal.&quot; Passenger Daisy McAndrew said she had been caught in the &quot;unholy mess&quot; at Gatwick as she tried to fly to Barcelona for work. &quot;As ever, staff have been fantastic but they know nothing other than the fact it is going to be a very, very long delay \u2013 very frustrating,&quot; McAndrew told Sky News. &quot;And also, it&apos;s embarrassing, isn&apos;t it? When you look around a lot of people on my plane are not British, they are flying British Airways, they are probably trying to get back to Spain and they will inevitably be thinking this is something that could have possibly been prevented. &quot;It doesn&apos;t show our air traffic control system or our travel system in a good light. &quot;I have never heard of an example where every single plane is grounded \u2013 it&apos;s quite eerie when I look out of the window to see the [runway] in Gatwick, normally so busy, and also the sky above Gatwick which is normally busy \u2013 completely static, there&apos;s nothing moving.&quot; A spokesman for Cardiff airport said all flights on Saturday morning had been affected.

But he would have been less surprised to learn that the British, that nation of shopkeepers, are set to flog off their share of the pioneering service. The decision to sell the nation&apos;s stake in Eurostar, just under two decades since Queen Elizabeth chugged down the tracks from Waterloo before speeding through the French countryside with President Mitterrand, was confirmed this week by the financial secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, as part of the updated infrastructure plan. The sell-off, first mooted by the coalition in 2010, was part of a doubled target for state asset sales to \u00a320bn. Eurostar, for all its significance, will form a tiny fraction of that. The majority 55% French stake is owned by the state-controlled SNCF, Britain has 40% via state-owned London &amp; Continental Railways, and 5% is owned by Belgian state railways. Analysts suggest the British stake will fetch around \u00a3120m-\u00a3200m, or 0.2%-0.4% of the price of HS2. After the accusations of undervaluing the privatised Royal Mail, ministers will be anxious about the price. A happier memory is the sale of Eurostar&apos;s effective landlord, HS1 \u2013 the company created to run the British high-speed link to St Pancras, a track finally built 13 years after Eurostar started services. HS1 was sold to Canadian investors for \u00a32.1bn, 20% above estimates. The government will soon start appointing advisers to run the sale, on a broad timeline to conclude by 2020. But the City view is that this may only attract one bidder: SNCF. Gerald Khoo, transport analyst at Liberum Capital, says: &quot;Realistically, there&apos;s only one obvious buyer: the owner of the 55%. Theoretically you might get someone who wants in, but a stake of something someone else owns and controls doesn&apos;t appeal to that many people. And if you&apos;ve only got one buyer, you get the worst price.&quot; The limited figures published by Eurostar suggest that, despite historically falling short of forecast passenger numbers, it pulls in solid returns on an effective monopoly. With revenues around \u00a3800m and profits for 2012 doubling to \u00a353m, the profit margin of 6.5% appears handsomely above that of domestic train operators. The limited data makes analysts loth to put a price on the stake, although one suggests a figure in the low hundreds of millions. Douglas McNeill, investment director at Charles Stanley, takes a punt at \u00a3500m-\u00a3700m for the company overall, which owns its rolling stock and has net cash in the bank. For a minority stake, Britain could expect a little less than the value of the 40% it owns. He rules out any UK transport groups bidding, saying: &quot;You&apos;d think SNCF was the prime contender. Otherwise, I&apos;d look more towards private equity firms or infrastructure funds. It&apos;s a utility-type business that ought to be able to deliver unspectacular but steady returns over time.&quot; Its effective monopoly will end when Deutsche Bahn also starts running trains through the tunnel. While a target date of 2016 has been mentioned, the German rail operator is understood not to have ordered trains yet, making that look likely to slip. Eurostar claims their arrival can only help. Mary Walsh, its communications director, says: &quot;We&apos;d welcome competition \u2013 it helps grow the market overall by transforming consumer perception.&quot; That perception will also be helped by Eurostar&apos;s decision to bid for the East Coast rail franchise with Keolis \u2013 raising the intriguing prospect of Eurostar from Edinburgh to Paris and beyond. Even if the French bid is successful, the east coast service won&apos;t be branded Eurostar, but the firm believes its experience in service for both business and leisure passengers puts it in good stead for a new train franchise. Walsh says: &quot;All these initiatives help foster enthusiasm for greater connectivity, and change the mindset that you can travel by train rather than plane at higher speeds over longer distances.&quot; Eurostar has raised \u00a3700m to overhaul and expand its existing fleet, and is stretching its routes to the Swiss Alps, Provence and \u2013 by 2016 \u2013 direct to Amsterdam, including a stop at the Air\u00a0France-KLM hub of Schiphol airport. Having initially suffered a drop in passenger figures when budget flying took off, making it cheaper for Brits to fly to distant reaches of the continent than travel by rail to Paris, Eurostar may find new markets as a feeder to long-haul aviation. In short, things look relatively rosy. So should the government cash in? Unions are opposed. The RMT&apos;s Bob Crow says it&apos;s typical that the government is &quot;prepared to flog off the valuable public stake in Eurostar just as this expanding and important service is moving into a new period of growth&quot;. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, says: &quot;The coalition sold this country short on the Royal Mail and it&apos;s going to sell this country short on Eurostar.&quot; And would the French ever countenance selling?

About a fifth of all flights were cancelled at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports while others faced delays of up to two hours following the problem at the National Air Traffic Services&apos; (Nats) control centre in Swanwick, Hampshire, which deals with air traffic in the south of England. Luton, Southampton, London City, Cardiff, Bristol, Bournemouth, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dublin airports also reported delays. Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted advised passengers on Sunday morning that flights were running as normal, though Heathrow&apos;s website advised passengers to check flight times before travelling to the airports. A Nats spokesman said on Saturday evening that the problem in the area control operations room at Swanwick, which began during a switch from night to day operations, had been fixed, adding that the issue had not affected passenger safety. He said: &quot;To be clear, this is a very complex and sophisticated system with more than a million lines of software. This is not simply internal telephones, it is the system that controllers use to speak to other [air traffic control] agencies both in the UK and Europe and is the biggest system of its kind in Europe. &quot;This has been a major challenge for our engineering team and for the manufacturer, who has worked closely with us to ensure this complex problem was resolved as quickly as possible while maintaining a safe service.&quot; Passengers at Heathrow, Europe&apos;s busiest airport, suffered delays of more than an hour on many morning departures, and several dozen short-haul flights to destinations including Nice, Milan and Istanbul were cancelled. A Stansted airport spokesman said all of its departing flights had been subject to delays of between 30 minutes and two hours, while Gatwick said 20% of its departures had been delayed, with passengers warned they could have to wait &quot;a couple of hours&quot;. One passenger, Daisy McAndrew, said she had been caught in the &quot;unholy mess&quot; at Gatwick as she tried to fly to Barcelona for work. &quot;As ever, staff have been fantastic but they know nothing other than the fact it is going to be a very, very long delay \u2013 very frustrating,&quot; McAndrew told Sky News. &quot;And also, it&apos;s embarrassing, isn&apos;t it? When you look around a lot of people on my plane are not British, they are flying British Airways, they are probably trying to get back to Spain and they will inevitably be thinking this is something that could have possibly been prevented.

Speaking at City Hall, Johnson also gave updated figures from a major police traffic operation launched following six cyclist deaths in less than two weeks, saying more than 2,000 motorists and cyclists had been stopped by officers in the past fortnight for infractions such as jumping red lights. Speaking at a conference about reducing the disproportionate number of cyclist deaths connected to lorries, Johnson said Transport for London would set out a programme to make 33 of the city&apos;s more dangerous junctions safer for bikes, and pledged to make London &quot;as popular with cyclists as the streets of Copenhagen or Amsterdam&quot;. The mayor said: &quot;There is now a growing chorus of voices who say that the cycling revolution has been going too fast and that we should somehow get all these cyclists off the roads and people look at me in an accusing way. &quot;This analysis grossly exaggerates my messianic abilities. I am a passionate cyclist, but I am not some kind of Pied Pedaller. People go by bike because they love to go by bike.&quot; This necessitated a focus on safety, he said, adding: &quot;We must make cycling even safer and wherever accidents take place, we must respond. We must see what could have been done to prevent them, we must immediately work out what we can do to stop them happening again, and we must address people&apos;s fears, well-founded or otherwise.&quot; Several of the recent deaths took place on or near so-called cycle superhighways, a network of routes along primarily main roads introduced by Johnson. Critics have argued that they encourage riders to use major roads and are, for the most part, not segregated, just marked by a strip of blue paint. A coroner investigating two earlier deaths on a cycle superhighway surmised that they could give riders a false sense of safety. Johnson has acknowledged that the current system is imperfect and has pledged to revamp much of it, using segregated lanes if feasible. He said: &quot;We will continue to expand and improve the superhighways and yes, where it is possible and sensible, we will segregate those routes, as we have done at Stratford. &quot;The cycling revolution will continue, and it will accelerate. This is not the time to slacken off or give up because if we get this right, the prize is huge. London should be in many ways a perfect city to ride a bike. &quot;If we can get Londoners on to bikes, we can take the pressure off public transport, we can reduce traffic and I believe we can help people to be fitter, calmer, less hassled and to enjoy the glories of the city in a way that is different every day.&quot; Johnson said the police crackdown, Operation Safeway, which has involved 2,500 officers stationed at more than 150 junctions, had led to 1,392 motorists and 755 cyclists being fined for offences, according to figures released towards the end of last week. Johnson is promising to spend around \u00a31bn on cycle infrastructure, including a pair of largely segregated through routes crossing the city, one north to south and another east to west, and a series of bike-friendly &quot;mini Hollands&quot; in outer suburbs. There was no reason, he argued, why cycling could not become mainstream: &quot;London should be in many ways a perfect city to ride a bike. We have a flat or gently undulating landscape \u2013 much less hilly than Paris. We have more green space and parks than any other city in Europe. We have perfect temperate weather.&quot; The recent police operation faced some criticism after some officers pulled over cyclists to warn them they should be wearing helmets and high-visibility clothing. The Highway Code recommends such gear, but some cycling campaigners argue such tactics are a distraction from the main peril facing bike riders: being forced to share the road with lorries. Trucks make up less than 5% of London traffic but are involved in more than 50% of cyclist deaths, primarily when a lorry turns left over a cyclist. Johnson and his cycle commissioner, Andrew Gilligan, stress that overall cycling remains safe in London, with the number of deaths falling over the years. Green members of the London assembly argue that the larger data set of deaths and serious injuries among cyclists has been rising recently.

Hannah Waldram, community manager for Europe, Instagram Setting up on Instagram: If you&apos;re just starting an account, we have some great resources for brands and businesses getting on Instagram. We have a new Business Blog, where we highlight lots of tips and best practice examples, and we also have a breakdown here of how to get started with your account. As a brand, I would say you need to have a separate strategy for using Instagram to your other social media strategies; it&apos;s brilliant for brand awareness and engagement and you should think about it entirely differently to how you might use Twitter or Facebook. In general, behind-the-scenes glimpses of how things are run, sneak peaks at new shows to build buzz and interest, all the way to running competitions and hashtag projects with winners gaining exclusive access to a new exhibition or show are great ideas to think about. Here&apos;s more about how to run a photo campaign. You should also definitely make sure your venue has a location page for Instagrammers to tag their great photos and videos to. Vicky Pearce, Horniman Museum and Gardens How to use Instagram hashtags: Hashtags are absolutely essential for Instagram sharing. For the large part they are the means by which most Instagram users browse photographs; unless they are already following your account, a hashtag is necessary for someone to find, like and comment on your images. When you upload a photo, you have the opportunity to add a caption. This is where you should use hashtags, either within the caption itself or simply as a list of words. Hashtags can also be added later in image comments, which is useful as you can&apos;t go back and edit your caption. There are plenty of sites and services online that offer lists of commonly used hashtags, which you can apply to your photos and share them with a wider audience who may be browsing those tags. Tips for your hashtags: Just keep them appropriate and relevant. There&apos;s nothing so irritating as #every #word #in #the #caption #being #hashtagged \u2013 so #museum is the big one we try to always include. I don&apos;t think the tag itself gets an awful lot of traffic, but from our point of view it&apos;s important to be setting our pictures in that museum community. Animals will always win big, so we never miss an opportunity to tag #owl, #cat or #bird. But it&apos;s worth knowing your audience and which online interest groups and communities hold possible new audiences for you, and gain some insight into what hashtags they&apos;re using. Although there are many lists of popular hashtags, these are usually widely overused (often by people looking for likes) and your picture may get lost in that tag. Need some inspiration?

The club were overwrought about what to do. Bids of \u00a3100m don&apos;t come along all that often, and at clubs whose finances are corset tight it was understandable that they felt torn down the middle. Heart said keep Kak\u00e1. Bank balance said sell. In the end, they renewed their vows and Milan&apos;s thankful fans flooded to the Brazilian&apos;s house to serenade him with song. And then, six months later, he was gone. To Real Madrid, it was a sum not quite as staggering as what Manchester City offered but it was still not to be sniffed at. Football doesn&apos;t often veer into the realms of the romantic novel, but here was our hero, sacrificing himself for the supposed good of his true love. Now, after a four-year haitus in Spain, he is back at his spiritual home. He is in the place he wants to be for his footballing dotage. But the growing old process is more turbulent than he might have imagined. Milan are not enjoying the best of times. They are languishing in Serie A mediocrity, a whopping 22 points off Juventus at the top. They are nine points off even a Europa League spot. That&apos;s profoundly uncomfortable. Boardroom politics have been spicy and troublesome. The coach, Massimiliano Allegri, contends with waves of criticism. The team is modest compared to the Rossoneri selections Kak\u00e1 grew up with. The fans are easily irritable. It all came to a head last month, when an angry group of ultras blocked the exits of San Siro in furious protest after a tame 1-1 draw against Genoa. Who better to calm the situation than Kak\u00e1? He was sent, along with his fellow veteran Christian Abbiati, to defuse the situation. His hashtag of choice, which he sends with regularity to a band of global disciples that number well over 17 million, is &quot;#togetherwearebetter.&quot; It might seem saccharine sweet, but if anyone at Milan can spread that message, Kak\u00e1 has the best possible chance of pulling it off. &quot;It is definitely a challenge to put off-field problems aside,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to try and put together a good season and do as well as we can on all fronts.&quot; The vignette symbolised how important his homecoming has been. On the pitch as well as off it with his flawless image he has made a difference, bringing a touch of class and calmness. There were questions about whether he could scale the kind of heights he managed in his first spell with Milan \u2013 understandable considering his years at the Bernab\u00e9u had been underwhelming. Kak\u00e1 has summoned moments to make Milan hearts soar. He was brilliant during a comprehensive Champions League win at Celtic Park, where he was even granted an ovation by the opposition fans. A sweet bending shot against Lazio \u2013 his first goal since coming back to the club \u2013 was another highlight. Kak\u00e1 and Mario Ballotelli, with their moments of individual quality, are dragging a struggling team through a difficult period. The current side bears little comparison to the XI which he came into as a kid in 2003. Kak\u00e1&apos;s first Champions League game was against Ajax, who Milan face this week with a place in the knockout stages at stake. A decade ago, he lined up alongside a string of luminaries: Dida, Cafu, Nesta, Costacurta, Maldini, Seedorf, Gattuso, Pirlo, Shevchenko and Inzaghi. What Allegri wouldn&apos;t do to call upon such a group. Milan&apos;s current crop all look up to Kak\u00e1, and are grateful to have such a figure back at the club to lead and absorb some of the pressure. His return in September encouraged everyone. &quot;He&apos;s my idol,&quot; cooed Stephan El Shaarawy. &quot;He&apos;s like a captain,&quot; declared Urby Emanuelson. Allegri was hopeful that his good habits and positivity would rub off on everyone. &quot;Kak\u00e1 is a great who can help his team-mates grow,&quot; said the coach. &quot;Off the pitch he is an example to all \u2013 he&apos;s educated, meticulous, serious and very tied to this club.&quot; To reach the Champions League knockout stage Milan must avoid defeat against Ajax. The Dutch team were close to beating the Italians when they drew 1-1 earlier this season in Amsterdam. A fortuitous penalty in the fourth minute of stoppage time, scored by Ballotelli, salvaged a draw. Ajax were buoyed by a win against Barcelona last time out, but Milan are hoping to build on one of their most cohesive displays at Celtic. Kak\u00e1 expressed his desire for that to be a turning point. This game against Ajax will be the first time they play in front of their home fans since the episode when Kak\u00e1 was required to calm the post-match protests. Milan have not lost since. But it remains a challenge to keep on an even keel as the upcoming games include the visit of Roma and the derby against Internazionale. Kak\u00e1 recently admitted that he had missed Milan during a four-year stint at Real Madrid. It was not the happiest time as he was dogged by injuries and only sporadically able to show flashes of form. Even though life back at San Siro is not perfect he feels better to be needed at the club he adores. He wants to lift both himself and his club. Ideally, as well as rescuing Milan, he can revive his international career this season. &quot;I&apos;m following Kak\u00e1 very closely,&quot; says Phil Scolari. &quot;World Cup chances? He is a Brazilian player, so his chance is as good as any other.&quot; Now 31, he is not too far over the age scale to suggest he cannot recapture enough form to persuade Scolari of his worth in a yellow shirt. &quot;I thank Milan for this second opportunity and I want to do well in order to have a great World Cup in Brazil.&quot; The efforts of a wise old head in Milan might just work out beautifully after all.", "sentences": ["The Dutch team were close to beating the Italians when they drew 1-1 earlier this season in Amsterdam."], "title": "Kak\u00e1 aiming to show Milan that they are better together after years apart | Amy Lawrence", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/dec/11/kaka-milan-better-together-champions-league", "tags": ["Kak\u00e1", "Milan", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-11T13:29:00Z", "article": "     Uruguay has become the first country in the world to make it legal to grow, sell and consume marijuana, but that doesn&apos;t mean there will be cannabis cafes popping up on the streets of the capital or in the popular holiday resorts on the Atlantic coast.

Drug laws around the world can be complicated. Here is a look at four places around the world and where you stand if you plan to light up.  Colorado state The law: It is legal to possess, use, distribute and cultivate cannabis. The reality: Over 21s can legally possess up to an ounce of cannabis and once the pot shops begin to open for business on January 1 2014, locals and tourists will be able to by one quarter of an ounce in a single transaction. For those under 21, cannabis possession, use and sale is still illegal, although if caught only for possession, they are likely to be dealt with in the same way as underage drinkers. Under 21s can take advantage of cannabis&apos; medical benefits, as long as they have parental consent as a patient. Washington state The law: It is legal to possess up to one ounce of cannabis, but it remains an offence to possess larger amounts, or to grow it. The reality: Over 21s can legally possess up to one ounce of cannabis, but unlike in Colorado it won&apos;t be possible to grow your own without a licence. Under 21s will face penalties if caught in possession of the drug, however it is likely to be a misdemeanour charge. And smokers are expected to puff in private; it&apos;s still illegal to spark up in public. This January retail stores will open and are expected to attract tourists.  Netherlands     A coffee shop in Amsterdam.  Photograph: Alamy    The law: Cannabis is tolerated, though it is still illegal. Possession of small amounts has been decriminialised and the drug can be bought from licensed &quot;coffee shops&quot;. The reality: As the two million tourists who flock to Amsterdam each year for a smoke will tell you, cannabis is as good as legal in the Netherlands. You will need to be over 18 and required to show ID to buy it in one of the country&apos;s many coffee shops, and purchases should be limited to five grams a day. However, it is illegal to buy cannabis on the street. As for consumption, smoking cannabis is tolerated in most public places, as long as it&apos;s not near a school, or near children. Don&apos;t assume you can smoke it in a pub, however, and remember that the ban on smoking tobacco exists even for coffeeshops, so you either have to smoke your spliff pure, with a herbal mix, or make your way into a separate tobacco smoking room if you wish to get high on the premises. Portugal The law: All drugs, including cannabis, cocaine and heroin, have been decrimalised since 2001. The reality: Although lots of countries in Europe have been experimenting with various degrees of decriminalisation, Portugal was the first country to go all the way. This does not mean drugs are legal, but personal use (under certain restrictions) will not lead to prosecution.

Anzelle Wasserman denied the claim by Karina Arden, counsel for Francesca Grillo, who along with her sister Elisabetta Grillo is accused of defrauding the TV cook and her former husband of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Arden asked Wasserman: &quot;You know, don&apos;t you, that Miss Lawson has signed an exclusive agreement with Oprah Winfrey in January?&quot; &quot;That&apos;s not correct,&quot; replied Wasserman. However, she did not give any further details as to which parts of Arden&apos;s claim were correct or incorrect. Wasserman, one of Lawson&apos;s current personal assistants, also denied that she had come to court in an attempt to save her employer&apos;s reputation. Last week, Lawson told Isleworth crown court that she had taken cocaine when her first husband was dying and again in 2010, arguing that on those occasions she did not have a drugs problem but &quot;a life problem&quot;. Arden challenged Wasserman over her reasons for giving evidence, saying: &quot;You, I suggest, have come to court partly to save \u2013 as you perceive it \u2013 Miss Lawson&apos;s reputation.&quot; Wasserman replied: &quot;I&apos;m here to give witness evidence about the trial of the Grillos because I worked for them for so long, and that is why I&apos;m here.&quot; The aide also denied that she had told her co-workers that she had &quot;greatly contributed&quot; to Lawson&apos;s professional success \u2013 and that she had a motto to the effect that it was her job &quot;to be the bitch&quot; among Lawson&apos;s employees. &quot;No, I&apos;ve never heard that, no,&quot; said Wasserman. The Grillo sisters are accused of spending \u00a3685,000 on the family&apos;s accounts without authorisation. They have claimed the spending was authorised by Lawson as part of a tacit understanding that they would not tell her then husband, Charles Saatchi, about Lawson&apos;s alleged use of cocaine and cannabis. Prosecutors claim the sisters lived the &quot;high life&quot; by splashing out on designer clothes and handbags from Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Vivienne Westwood. Elisabetta Grillo, 41, and Francesca Grillo, 35, each deny a single count of fraud. The court heard on Wednesday that Francesca Grillo had accompanied Lawson&apos;s children and Saatchi&apos;s daughter on numerous foreign trips to cities including Paris, New York, Miami, Los Angeles and Amsterdam. Cross-examining Wasserman over the use of credit cards issued to employees by Saatchi, Arden referred to texts sent to her by Francesca Grillo while on a &quot;super-expensive&quot; trip to the south of France with one of the children and some of their friends. The message, sent while Grillo was in St Tropez, asked Wasserman to get in touch with Saatchi&apos;s finance director, Rahul Gajjar, as the costs of the trip were rapidly mounting. &quot;Could you please ask Rahul to make sure my card is being paid off so I have enough credit over here?&quot; asked Grillo. &quot;I have to take cash out every day for cabs and clubs and I&apos;m worried I won&apos;t have enough.&quot; Wasserman texted back: &quot;I&apos;ve just spoken to Rahul. He&apos;s going to speak to the bank to tell them you&apos;re in St Tropez but he says your card doesn&apos;t have a limit so it shouldn&apos;t be a problem.&quot; Asked why Francesca Grillo&apos;s credit card \u2013 which was tied to Saatchi&apos;s account with the private bank Coutts \u2013 had no limit on it when all the other personal assistants&apos; cards did, Wasserman said she did not know. She told the court: &quot;I don&apos;t know what the situation was between her and Rahul. It was nothing to do with me.

His job is to direct passing tourists towards a nearby &quot;gentleman&apos;s club&quot;. He earns 300,000 forint (\u00a3830) per month in a country where the average wage is less than half this amount. He speaks five languages and is happy to answer questions during what he says is a &quot;slow&quot; evening. Even so, he talks to 12 English-speaking interested men within a 20-minute period. The commercial sex industry is not legal in Hungary, but it is tolerated and exists largely in plain view. Hungary is a key &quot;source&quot; location for women and girls being trafficked to countries where prostitution is legal, such as Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. In those countries, women and girls are brought in to supply the legally sanctioned demand. Those who support the legalisation and decriminalisation of prostitution often do so with the intended goal of making prostitution better and safer for those involved. Yet, survivors of sex trafficking have repeatedly stated that legalisation and decriminalisation of the commercial sex industry does just the opposite. A statement signed by 177 verified sex trafficking survivors from Sex Trafficking Survivors United (STSU) suggests that: &quot;Without the buyers of commercial sex, sex trafficking would not exist. If we start penalising and stigmatising the buyers, we could end sex trafficking in our lifetime \u2026 prostitution is not a victimless crime; it is a brutal form of sexual violence.&quot; Europe is finally starting to listen. A new trend is emerging \u2013 criminalising the buyers, traffickers and pimps that fuel the commercial sex industry, while decriminalising and providing services and exit options to people in prostitution. Starting in 1999, Sweden, Norway and Iceland implemented this &quot;Nordic model&quot; of prostitution policy. These laws aim to reduce all demand, recognising that due to the widespread coercion within legal prostitution sectors, it is simply not possible to differentiate the demand which is exploitative from that which is not. France has recognised this and its assembly voted in favor of adopting the model last week; Ireland is due to follow shortly; Finland&apos;s Ministry for Justice has called for the same. The Netherlands and Germany \u2013 which attempted to regulate prostitution in 2000 and 2002 respectively \u2013 are beginning to backtrack from their failed experiments, with politicians pushing for new laws to criminalise the purchase of sex from a victim of trafficking or coercion. In the United Kingdom, we hope that Theresa May MP&apos;s &quot;modern slavery bill&quot; will include provisions that tackle demand specifically. If Ireland follows France&apos;s lead by adopting the Nordic model \u2013 and the UK fails to criminalise demand \u2013 it may have to respond quickly as traffickers move across borders to a legislative environment which is more favourable. This European trend towards criminalising the purchase of sex and decriminalising people in prostitution echoes Mary Honeyball MEP&apos;s recommendation in her European parliament report that the Nordic model be implemented throughout the continent. It is also consistent with the legal obligation of all EU member states to tackle the demand that &quot;fosters all forms of exploitation related to trafficking&quot;, as emphasised by EU anti-trafficking co-ordinator, Myria Vassiliadou. It reflects too the recommendation by EU commissioner for home affairs, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, for countries to take action to reduce the demand for sexual exploitation. Back in Budapest, Zsolt does not realise that he is part of the reason why sex trafficking continues to flourish. He does not know that the 14-year-old girl from his home town, who can&apos;t speak English or Dutch and thinks she is going to work in a hairdresser&apos;s in Amsterdam, ends up in a window in a Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za street, purchased for sex by &quot;red light visitors&quot;. We urge the UK and all European governments to implement the Nordic model throughout the continent. This will not only ensure that the lives of countless women and girls are improved, it will also send a strong signal to people like Zsolt, who do not fully appreciate that by enabling the commercial sex industry, they are concealing the exploitation and violence which is at its core.", "sentences": ["He does not know that the 14-year-old girl from his home town, who can&apos;t speak English or Dutch and thinks she is going to work in a hairdresser&apos;s in Amsterdam, ends up in a window in a Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za street, purchased for sex by &quot;red light visitors&quot;."], "title": "Europe is finally starting to tackle prostitution in the right way | Lauren Hersh", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/12/europe-prostitution-sex-trafficking-nordic-model", "tags": ["Prostitution", "Europe", "World news", "Society", "Hungary", "Human trafficking", "Law"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-12T11:56:00Z", "article": "First performed in 1920, Der Schatzgr\u00e4ber (The Treasure Seeker) was Franz Schreker&apos;s fifth opera.

By repeating the dramatic recipe \u2013 violence, magic and sexual repression in a make-believe historical setting \u2013 that had worked so well in Der Ferne Klang (1912) and Die Gezeichneten (1918), which established him as one of the most significant modernist opera composers of his time, and matching it to a score that offered a watered-down version of modernism alongside late romantic music, Schreker appealed to both progressive and conservative opera audiences. The libretto for Schatzgr\u00e4ber was Schreker&apos;s own. It&apos;s a fairytale plot about stolen royal jewels, eternal youth, a wandering minstrel and a magic lute that can find hidden treasure. The music makes it credible because it deals in real emotions.

Speaking of which, did you ever whip out a chessboard and play your team-mates? All the time! I could beat most of them but Zvonimir Boban was something else. He was by far the best. A demon.

I even went to visit him when he played Wijk aan Zee. Really? Carlsen likes playing football, doesn&apos;t he? He&apos;s OK. I didn&apos;t need to give him many tips. Actually, we spent most of our time talking about the similarities between football and chess. So the cliche about a football game being like a chess match isn&apos;t a lazy myth? Oh no: there are so many similarities, especially when it comes to speed chess. In both games you have to think fast. In chess you tend to know all the patterns already, just like in football \u2026 Interesting, now \u2026 [enthusiastically] Both involve thinking but they are also intuitive; because you train so much your unconscious mind can take over. And in both games if you make one mistake it can be all over. Time is short Edgar so a few quick fire questions. Ruud Gullit or Dennis Bergkamp? Gullit [a puzzled expression comes over his face] Er, is that with chess? Just football Edgar. Definitely Gullit. Don&apos;t get me wrong, Dennis was, without a doubt very important for Dutch football. But Gullit was a dominator. And you only ever get a couple of dominators in world football at any one time. When Gullit played well, his whole team played well \u2013 whether it was at Milan or Sampdoria or the national side. He could carry a whole team on his back and make them win.

No. It&apos;s a drama from a family from Morocco that lives in Amsterdam. It&apos;s very good, really. And your favourite CD? I love music but there are so many! Maybe Bob Marley. What&apos;s your pre-match meal? Pasta. Simple tomato sauce or creamy carbonara? I&apos;ve always had whatever I was given. Good man. Do any of the Barnet players play chess? Well, I&apos;ve actually put a chessboard and pieces at the club \u2026 Really? Have any of your players dared to take you on yet? No, but some of them can play. In fact I play with our assistant coach. So who wins? Well, he thought he was the best and claimed he had never lost \u2026 [Pinteresque pause]. And then he met you?

Carolyn Drake: Two Rivers (self-published)     An Uzbek woman in her courtyard in the covering her husband wishes her to wear in public. Photograph: Carolyn Drake    Beautiful and atmospheric colour images made during 15 trips across the vast expanse of land that lies between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers in central Asia. Drake is a master of atmosphere. John Cage and William Gedney: Iris Garden (Little Brown Mushroom) Alec Soth&apos;s Little Brown Mushroom imprint continues in its brilliantly wayward way with this beautiful book. Forty-four intimate snapshots by Gedney of Cage are intercut with 22 very short stories by the great experimental composer. The book is unbound so you can apply Cage&apos;s theory of chance by browsing it in a different order every time. Marten Borgen: Tractor Boys (Dewi Lewis) Hazy images of teenage boy racers in Sweden who restore and then wreck old EPA tractors \u2013 old cars that have been converted for use on farms. It&apos;s an adolescent world of cars and girls beautifully evoked in black and white. Daniel Gordon: Still Lifes, Portraits and Parts (Morel Books) Like Lorenzo Viturri, Gordon is a sculptor of photography, form and colour. His garishly bright creations have an energy and handmade feel that mischievously plays with notions of still life and portraiture. As far away from traditional photography as you can imagine, but oddly intoxicating. Edmund Clark: Control Order House (Here Press)     Control Order House. Photograph: Edmund Clark    Clark followed up his book inside Guantanamo with a more intimate study of an anonymous British house temporarily inhabited by a man suspected of terrorist-related activity. Stark photographs sit alongside the suspect&apos;s mundane diary entries and Clark&apos;s Kafkaesque correspondence with the Home Office. Mike Brodie: A Period of Juvenile Prosperity (Twin Palms) Brodie&apos;s unashamedly romantic images of the young drifters he rode the trains around the US with for a few years back in the early 00s finally made it into book form this year, having been an internet sensation back then. Warm, faded colours lend a certain style to these snapshots of the nomadic life lived for a time by his band of outsiders and bohos. Lisa Barnard: Chateau Despair (GOST)     Mouldy photographs of Iain Duncan Smith at 32 Smith Square. Photograph: Lisa Barnard    New indie publishers GOST offered a strong statement of intent with Lisa Barnard&apos;s study of 32 Smith Square, Westminster, aka the Tory head office from 1958 to 2004. The empty derelict space is full of old ghosts: fading photos of Margaret Thatcher, campaign posters, an unused celebratory firework. The title is the nickname bestowed on the place by the minions who worked there. Lieko Shiga: Rasen Keigan  (Akaaka) It is hard to describe the approach of self-taught photographer Lieko Shiga, other than to say she mixes a heightened observation with a surrealist style to summon up memories of the Japanese tsunami of 2011 in this vivid, disturbing book. Set in the coastal town of Kitakama, it is a book of memory and reimagining and arguably the most original photobook of the year. Jeff Jacobsen: The Last Roll (Daylight) An elegiac book from Jeff Jacobsen, who was diagnosed with cancer towards the end of 2004. After each chemotherapy session, he returned to his house in the Catskills and shot the world outside on the Kodachrome film he had stockpiled in his fridge following the announcement that its production was being discontinued.

The actor has immersed himself in character \u2013 replete with 1970s hair, moustache and suits \u2013 for a months-long, ubiquitous marketing blitz which has blurred reality and satire.\u00a0Burgundy, a vainglorious, buffoonish chauvinist, has fronted dozens of commercials, co-hosted actual TV programmes, bantered on talk shows and addressed media gatherings. He also released a book, an ice cream flavour and his own brand of scotch. Anchorman\u00a02: The Legend Continues does not open until next week but some are crying enough already, saying Paramount&apos;s publicity campaign has overexposed all things Burgundy, and asking &quot;Would he please evaporate?&quot; \u201cWe predict the nation will be officially burned out on Burgundy,\u201d The Wire\u00a0grumbled last week, echoing a small, vocal backlash. Twitter debated whether the character had peaked and now inspired only fatigue. \u201cIs there a such thing as\u00a0too much\u00a0Ron Burgundy?\u201d asked The Wrap. To which the moustachioed one would likely reply: \u201cYou are a smelly pirate hooker. Why don\u2019t you go back to your home on Whore Island?\u201d Film industry figures did not put it in those terms but largely agreed that when it comes to marketing\u00a0Anchorman, more is more.\u00a0\u201cIt&apos;s a breakthrough campaign. A really smart strategy by Paramount,\u201d said Matti Leshem, a TV producer and founder of the LA-based brand strategy agency Protagonist. Box office tracking suggested the comedy will perform well against rival films \u2013 Saving Mr Banks, Walking with Dinosaurs and American Hustle \u2013 which open at the same time, he said.\u00a0Confusing reality with the antics of the San Diego newsman was a \u201ctitillating and naughty\u201d tactic. \u201cIt will probably help them win the weekend.\u201d Burgundy&apos;s zelig-like appearances in multiple contexts fuelled \u201ctotal awareness\u201d in a crowded marketplace, said Jesse Berger, a producer and co-founder of Radical studios whose credits include Oblivion and the upcoming Hercules. The average cinema-goer would have seen only a small fraction of Burgundy&apos;s appearances\u00a0and so was not sick of the character, he said. \u201cYou have to realise how distracted the general consumer is and how much noise is out there.\u201d The first\u00a0Anchorman, directed by Adam McKay, produced by Judd Apatow and co-starring Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd, performed respectably in 2004 and later became a cult hit with fans, who adopted catchphrases such as \u201cStay classy, San Diego,&quot; paving the way to a sequel. Only pop culture obsessives would know that since March Burgundy has, among other things, appeared in 70 Dodge Durango commercials (helping to boost sales by 59%),\u00a0presented an MTV award in Amsterdam, interviewed Peyton Manning for ESPN, played the flute on Conan O&apos;Brien, published a book (Let Me Off at the Top: My Classy Life and Other Musings, which was excerpted in The New Yorker),\u00a0performed YouTube skits for Australian and British audiences, toured with Daft Punk, anchored a real newscast in North Dakota,\u00a0unveiled a Burgundy exhibit at Washington&apos;s Newseum and addressed Boston&apos;s Emerson college, which renamed its communication school after him for a day. Sasha Baron Cohen appeared in character in elaborate stunts to publicise Borat, Bruno and the Dictator but Ferrell&apos;s ubiquity and endurance has raised \u2013 or lowered, depending on your view \u2013 the bar to a new level. Appearing as Burgundy made sense because these days a film&apos;s selling point was its character \u2013 be it Iron Man, Batman, Superman, Wolverine \u2013 not the star, said Charles Gant, film editor of Heat magazine and the Guardian&apos;s UK box-office columnist. \u201cI\u2019m not sure in any case that the world is really crying out to see Will Ferrell in person. The anticipation for\u00a0Anchorman\u00a02 is certainly bigger than there has been for a Ferrell movie in a long time. As long as Ferrell is confident that he can act spontaneously as Burgundy \u2013 and he has enough scripted material to selectively deploy as needed \u2013 then he should go right ahead and stay in character.\u201d Even so, vocal fan-boy enthusiasm was no guarantee of mainstream success, Gant warned. Steve Coogan considered promoting Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa in character as the hapless DJ but decided against it. The Avengers&apos; marketing team put actor Tom Hiddleston in character as Norse god Loki but only in the controlled, supportive environment of Comic-Con.\u00a0 Berger, an executive producer on Hercules, said there was no way actor Dwayne Johnson\u00a0could stay in sandals and leather to promote the film. \u201cWhen you know how much energy went into creating the fantasy on screen, it just wouldn&apos;t be appropriate to take [the character] out of the film experience.\u00a0Anchorman\u00a0however is different.\u201d The comedy also benefited, he said, from a lengthy marketing campaign which built momentum with innumerable video clips shared via Facebook, Twitter and other networks. \u201cThat&apos;s what these campaigns are designed to do.

The reality, of course, is more complicated, but the idea persists of a retro-fixated would-be utopia that has precious little to teach the rest of the country. And yet, for the past two years, Brighton has been blazing a trail away from Westminster&apos;s tired three-party system towards a much more interesting way of doing politics. At the 2010 general election the constituency of Brighton Pavilion elected Britain&apos;s only Green party MP, Caroline Lucas. Since 2011, Brighton and Hove city council has been led by the same party. The Greens have 21 councillors to the Tories&apos; 18 and Labour&apos;s 14 (just to prove that Brighton is cooler than a lot of other places, the Lib Dems have none at all). For the past two-and-a-half years, they have formed a minority administration, pledged to making the city fairer and more sustainable, despite cruel cuts handed down by the coalition. With a slight air of overexcitement, their leading lights say they want to make Brighton like Barcelona, Sydney or Toronto, while other Greens seem to think it can be some sort of revolutionary hotbed a la Petrograd, or Turin \u2013 or, if necessary, Liverpool circa 1985. And there have been unarguable successes. Thanks to the council&apos;s crusade for better pay, 102 of the 400 private UK businesses that pay the living wage are located here. The local Greens have embraced imaginative policies on housing and regeneration, and officially declared hundreds of acres of council land &quot;open-owned&quot;. Brighton has become the world&apos;s first &quot;One Planet&quot; city, and much is made of plans for everyone there to &quot;live well within a fairer share of the earth&apos;s resources&quot;. What has played out here may well be a portent of life beyond traditional party politics, where a fiercely engaged, socially networked electorate send things spinning away from the usual way of doing things. The trouble is, it has been accompanied by an unholy series of battles that have set the Greens not just against their usual political enemies \u2013 witness an ongoing battle over raised parking charges and lowered speed limits \u2013 but each other. And now Brighton&apos;s radical Green future is in real danger of being snuffed out before it has even got started. The Greens still affect an air of determined optimism. &quot;William Gibson once said: &apos;The future&apos;s already here but it&apos;s not evenly distributed,&apos;&quot; says the Green&apos;s council leader (or, to use their preferred title, &quot;convenor&quot;). &quot;Maybe we&apos;re seeing the future of politics in Brighton before the rest of the country catches up.&quot; His name? Jason Kitcat. The surname, he tells me, comes from the west country, and an era long before chocolate snacks and cat food. It meant that he was teased at school. &quot;Heavily, yeah,&quot; he says, with a guffaw. &quot;But it gave me the thick skin to be a politician now.&quot; We meet just behind Brighton station, in the New England quarter, at a huge block of reconditioned shipping containers that a local housing trust has done up as flats. They will be used by people currently in homeless hostels: an example, I&apos;m told, of &quot;the Brighton spirit&quot;, which exemplifies creativity, ambition, and the idea that you can get things done quicker than some people think.     Jason Kitcat, Brighton Councillor \u2026 has had 'a few ups and downs'. Photograph: The Green Party    Kitcat is 35. He&apos;s a warm, occasionally self-deprecating presence, with a goatee beard that probably makes stereotyping him easier than it should be. His Polish-born wife, Ania, is also a Green councillor. He came to Brighton in 2000 to start an internet business, joined the Greens because he liked the idea of &quot;thinking very long-term&quot;, and became the figurehead of the council in May last year. How has his first 18 months at the top actually been? &quot;All councils are having a tough time,&quot; he says. &quot;But I&apos;m not going to deny that we&apos;ve had some ups and downs, and as the only Green council, and the first Green council, there&apos;s been particular attention. And we have unfortunately provided some ill-advised stories which have not been helpful.&quot; It is something of an understatement. This summer, as hundreds of thousands of people swarmed to Brighton to enjoy the tropical temperatures, the Greens hit big trouble. First, the time came for Kitcat&apos;s annual re-adoption as council leader, and one of his own colleagues sent a private tweet to the leader of the council&apos;s Labour group, in effect asking if he would support an anti-Kitcat coup. Inevitably, Labour was delighted, and it gleefully went public. (&quot;It was a tricky time,&quot; says Kitcat. &quot;But she apologised profusely, and I accepted her apology and we moved on.&quot;) Another Green councillor took to his blog and gave the following glowing summary of Kitcat&apos;s record: &quot;Jason Kitcat&apos;s policies have time and again betrayed working people, city residents \u2013 and the electoral interests of the Green Party of England and Wales.&quot; That must have been nice. &quot;I would have preferred it not to have happened,&quot; says Kitcat. Then came the infamous bin strike. Kitcat&apos;s administration had resolved to belatedly bring the council into line with equal-pay legislation, but the process was handed over to council officers, rather than being worked through by politicians. As some saw it, he was washing his hands of responsibility for the proposed outcome \u2013 pay cuts of as much as \u00a34,000 for some of the council&apos;s rubbish-collecting and street-cleaning workers. The result was a week-long strike, and strange scenes indeed: rubbish piling up in the streets and businesses being warned against clearing the streets themselves by a mysterious outfit called &quot;the Brighton and Hove Talibin&quot;. Lucas supported the strikers; Kitcat was apparently nowhere to be seen. Author and local resident Lynne Truss delivered a picture of what happened. &quot;The place turned into Armageddon,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Helped by foxes and the seagulls ... a tide of used teabags, eggshells, soiled kitchen paper, banana skins, smelly tin cans, and used sanitary towels (yes!) advanced in such a determined and menacing manner down nice residential streets, you could almost hear it breathing.&quot; &quot;It wasn&apos;t pleasant,&quot; says Kitcat. &quot;It was very difficult. Of course it was. We didn&apos;t want to be there.&quot;     Caroline Lucas celebrates after becoming Britain's first Green Party MP. Photograph: PA Archive/Press Association Ima    And how did he feel about Lucas being on one side and him on the other? &quot;Ultimately, we both wanted a fair outcome. The difference was, I was in the driving seat. From a negotiating point of view, I couldn&apos;t be out on the picket lines, could I?&quot; He insists that contrary to allegations that he hid himself away, he &quot;was in conversation on a weekly basis with the union officials, and all the officers involved&quot;. He claims the eventual agreement as a success \u2013 but those who wanted to portray the Greens as a divided shambles had no end of ammunition, and they were helped by the party&apos;s noble refusal to adopt an orthodox disciplinary system whereby any rebels could be whipped into line. Some of them, it was claimed, were &quot;watermelons&quot;: green on the outside, but red in the middle, and therefore dangerously leftwing. Others, such as Kitcat, were said to be &quot;mangoes&quot;, with orange metaphorical pulp, denoting the cautious and centrist instincts of the Lib Dems. There was even talk of &quot;figs&quot; \u2013 green-and-black types \u2013 who were essentially eco-anarchists. &quot;There genuinely isn&apos;t a kind of hard split between different people, and fruits. It&apos;s not the case,&quot; Kitcat insists. He laughs like a drain. &quot;The media and the public seem to want authentic, free-speaking politicians, who seem genuine and honest, and not constrained in how they put forward their ideas. On the other hand, every time someone seems to break with the leaders or the party line, they&apos;re a rebel, and it&apos;s &apos;splits&apos;. We&apos;re in a bit of a bind, aren&apos;t we?&quot; Next year, the Greens come to a big juncture. They will have to make around \u00a325m of cuts from the council&apos;s budget, and the scope for efficiency savings will have run out. Kitcat says his party will &quot;do the best we can for the people of the city&quot;, but the decisions required will inevitably be unpleasant. Some people think that pushing through such punishing measures will kill the Greens&apos; lefty credentials, and it would be much better if they picked a watershed fight with the government.     North Laine district \u2026 the classic image of Brighton. Photograph: Alamy    Ben Duncan is one of the alleged watermelons, and the councillor who accused Kitcat of betrayal in his blogpost. A former journalist who now works for a Green party MEP, Duncan has floated a handful of provocative ideas, including a &quot;tourist tax&quot; on some of the city&apos;s bigger hotels, a possible boycott of one of the taxi firms opposed to the Greens&apos; 20mph speed limit, and the possibility of Brighton allowing the opening of cannabis cafes and becoming the British version of Amsterdam. When asked on Twitter if he himself inhaled, he said this: &quot;I only smoke weed when I&apos;m murdering, raping and looting!&quot; It was, he says, a reference to the famous anti-cannabis film Reefer Madness, but his political enemies didn&apos;t seem to get the joke. Now, he is really on the warpath. There is mileage, he reckons, in the idea of the Greens following the lead of Trotskyite Labour councillors in 1980s Liverpool, refusing to set a cuts-based budget, and thereby putting Brighton in the vanguard of UK-wide anti-austerity resistance. Appropriately enough, we meet in a city-centre cafe called the Red Roaster. &quot;I think we need to do something that makes people think: &apos;Hang on \u2013 if you vote for the Greens you get something different,&apos;&quot; he tells me. &quot;On behalf of people around the country, we need to make it Brighton and Hove versus this government, about austerity. We should either refuse to set a budget or try and set a budget that under the current legislation would be unlawful, and say to the government, &apos;Well, you come in and do it \u2013 you see how local people benefit from you sending a hit squad in to take over from elected politicians who won&apos;t deliver your austerity measures.&apos;&quot; Kitcat isn&apos;t impressed. &quot;It&apos;s absurd, frankly,&quot; he says. &quot;Gestures like that will actually change nothing for residents, because the government will impose a budget on the council anyway.&quot; Duncan, however, says he will keep on keeping on \u2013 so one presumes that in the buildup to a final decision, it&apos;ll be mangoes and watermelons all round, again. The leader of Brighton and Hove Council&apos;s Labour group is 46-year-old Warren Morgan, who looks like Al McWhiggin, the villain in Toy Story 2 (thick-set, glasses, neat beard). In September, he called on the Greens to &quot;get a grip, or quit&quot;, said they were making Brighton &quot;a laughing stock&quot;, and proposed a moratorium on all new Green schemes, &quot;unless it can be proved that they have public support&quot;. He has made a habit of going after the Greens on issues such as cannabis cafes and ill-advised tweets, which may indicate that by Brighton standards he&apos;s a bit of a square. At this suggestion, he emits a noise halfway between a groan and a smirk. &quot;Speaking personally, I&apos;m not the most hipster of people,&quot; he says. &quot;Some people in Brighton would not identify with that image. It&apos;s a very, very varied city. It&apos;s not all hipster-cafe arts culture. And we try and represent everybody. &quot;The Greens&apos; focus has been far too much on the city centre,&quot; he says. &quot;They are not a party of the estates. They&apos;re a party of the city centre and the universities. There&apos;s nothing wrong with that electorate, but they need a broader view.&quot; With Labour on 38%, the Tories on 25%, and the Greens on 21%, Morgan seems to fancy his chances of being the council&apos;s next leader. He and his comrades also want to use the Greens&apos; travails to bring down Brighton&apos;s brightest political star, Caroline Lucas. If her seat fell to Labour, politics-as-usual would return to this patch of the south coast, and the short era of watermelons, mangoes and figs would be over. &quot;I have a lot of confidence in the people of Brighton,&quot; she tells me. &quot;And I&apos;m confident that they&apos;ll make a distinction where necessary \u2026 to be able to judge me on my record. I don&apos;t think you can hold an MP answerable for decisions they had no control over. People like to have an independent Green voice in parliament, and irrespective of their views about the local council, I think many people would be very sorry to lose that voice, sticking up for Brighton.&quot; That might suggest she&apos;s trying to distance herself from her own party&apos;s local record, but when prompted, she comes out with a long list of Kitcat and co&apos;s achievements. She also talks about her own work in parliament: reminding Labour of its supposed principles and opposing the renewal of Trident, putting the case for the public ownership of the railways, and more. But what happens if all that gets sacrificed on the altar of ill-advised tweets and the bin strike? It&apos;d be a crying shame? &quot;It would be a crying shame,&quot; she says, and emits a mirthless laugh. Does she think of herself as a mango or a watermelon? &quot;I&apos;ve always refused to answer that question. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a helpful question, and I&apos;m not going to define myself as a piece of fruit,&quot; she says. I&apos;ve always liked to think of her as having watermelon-ish leanings. &quot;Thank you. But I&apos;m not commenting on my fruitiness, to you or anyone else.&quot;", "sentences": ["A former journalist who now works for a Green party MEP, Duncan has floated a handful of provocative ideas, including a &quot;tourist tax&quot; on some of the city&apos;s bigger hotels, a possible boycott of one of the taxi firms opposed to the Greens&apos; 20mph speed limit, and the possibility of Brighton allowing the opening of cannabis cafes and becoming the British version of Amsterdam."], "title": "Have the Greens blown it in Brighton?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/15/greens-blown-it-in-brighton", "tags": ["Green party", "Brighton", "UK news", "Caroline Lucas", "Politics", "Local politics", "Local government"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-17T16:02:13Z", "article": "They have built a romanesque church out of sparkly blue sequins, a school that looks like a gothic wedding cake and turned the head of Hercules into a squishy seat.

They make me feel ill,&apos;\u201d recalls de Botton. \u201cI therefore knew right away that we had to move in a very particular direction \u2013 and that there was possibly only player in town who could respond adequately.\u201d     A House for Essex &hellip; the Living Architecture holiday home, designed with Grayson Perry Image: FAT    Unlike countless other radical architectural collectives that went before them, such as the hallowed Archigram, FAT&apos;s work has not been confined to the safe, hermetic haven of galleries and books. Over the last two decades they have built housing and offices, community buildings and a public library, an art college and a gargantuan TV studio \u2013 complete with a 260m-long facade of sci-fi-baroque mouldings. \u201cIt was all a bit of an accident,\u201d says Jacob. \u201cWe never imagined we would be a conventional architecture office. It wasn&apos;t really a career choice.\u201d The practice, whose name stands for Fashion Architecture Taste, began as a loose artistic collective in the early 90s, when 20 recent graduates coalesced around provocative tutor Kevin Rowbotham. Coming from backgrounds in architecture, graphic design, film-making and photography, the group began with temporary public art projects that engaged with sites in the city, from bus stops to carrier bags. \u201cIt was born out of a utopian idea that architecture is much bigger than the way architects define it,\u201d says Jacob. \u201cWe were looking at the limits of architecture, trying to find moments that you could appropriate, or subvert how the city works.\u201d Following the common pattern of a young practice, FAT designed a number of exhibitions and nightclub interiors, until their big break came with the office of Dutch advertising agency, Kessels Kramer. Conceived as a whimsical hill-town squeezed into a 19th-century church in Amsterdam, it was more outlandish than any Googleplex or Facebookworld could ever hope to be, and it included a wooden fort, a lifeguard&apos;s tower, fragments of astroturf pitches and a meeting room decked out like a fairytale forest.     The Blue House &hellip; Sean Griffiths' house in Hackney, completed 2002 Photograph: Morley von Sternberg/FAT    It was the first iteration of what would become the trio&apos;s trademark approach of surreal sampling and cartoonish collage, taking a rich plethora of references and mashing them together with playful abandon. \u201cIt was all because of Photoshop and Illustrator,\u201d says Jacob. \u201cThese tools allowed us to bring all kinds of things together in a very sophisticated collage machine.\u201d While other offices were exploring the potential of digital technology to conjure fantastical forms from the ether, FAT&apos;s approach was refreshingly luddite, using the natural flatness of vector graphics as a way of layering up dense 3D stage-sets, or what they would come to call \u201cfigural sections\u201d. They were egged on by finds from bookshops&apos; bargain basements, amassing tomes on Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Charles Moore, the unfashionable giants of postmodernism who had been erased from 90s curricular by the prevailing passion for beige. Venturi&apos;s definition of the \u201cdecorated shed,\u201d of warehouses smothered in signage that he observed in Las Vegas, became one of FAT&apos;s key tenets, as they began to use the depth of the facade as an expressive device.\u00a0     Islington Square &hellip; an exuberant brick wall surrounds clever family housing in Manchester Photograph: Tim Soar/FAT    Sean Griffiths&apos; Blue House in Hackney, built in 2002, stands as a powerful distillation of these early ideas. From the street, it depicts the cut-out form of a diminutive pitched-roof house, stuck on to a cartoon office block. It is the ultimate expression of a live-work unit, presented with cookie-cutter clarity. But the flimsy flatness of the facade belies the complexity within, where theatrical stairs, overscaled architraves and ambiguous thresholds produce a finely crafted sequence. It is \u201cAdolf Loos on the inside, South Park on the outside,&quot; as Griffiths puts it. The same tactic was tested on a bigger scale four years later, with a series of terraced houses for Urban Splash in Manchester&apos;s New Islington. Here, a great brick wall marches around the development, sporting a loud argyle pattern, its profile swelling and swooping to define each individual house while tying them together, citadel-like with a fortified skin. But again, it is no mere surface whimsy: the compact internal planning behind the garish garb is some of the cleverest of any family housing of the last decade. Elsewhere, FAT&apos;s preoccupation with external exuberance hasn&apos;t always led to happy endings. In Middlesbrough&apos;s Middlehaven docks, their Community in a Cube, developed for the now-defunct BioRegional Quintain, stands as a surreal domestic triptych. It is a modernist apartment block, resting on a Swiss mountain chalet, with a street of suburban American clapboard homes on the roof. It is a brilliant conceit, with a theatrical entrance up a baroque series of stairs and terraces. But it&apos;s hard to stomach the fact that its form means that four rooms per floor look out on a blank wall 3 metres away.     Community in a Cube &hellip; the surreal domestic triptych towers over Middlesbrough's Middlehaven docks. Photograph: Rob Parrish/FAT    Like their street at New Islington, which still looks on to overgrown plots, the Middlehaven cube stands alone in a post-industrial wasteland of early Noughties ambition, seeming all the more lonely for its jollity. Just as the riotous frieze of their BBC TV studios in Cardiff Bay faces a bleak prospect of empty plots, it seems the fate of their biggest projects was to stand in empty isolation, shouting jokes out into the void. But what of the practice&apos;s lasting influence? \u201cKeep up the bad work,\u201d Robert Venturi once told FAT, in an utterance of high praise, and it is perhaps their obstinate approach to being determinedly unfashionable that has limited any further success. \u201cThey were too clever by half,\u201d says critic Charles Jencks, the American godfather of postmodernism who has been a champion of their work. \u201cThey made a tactical manoeuvre of going explicitly against the tide, which certainly works in the art world, but not so much with buildings. They were always given the B-movie commissions, which is a great shame.\u201d He compares their trajectory with the rise of Grayson Perry, arguing that while the latter has become \u201cthe Hogarth of our times\u201d, FAT haven&apos;t had the chance to express their ideas at the scale they deserve.

Photograph: Tim Soar/FAT    \u201cThey&apos;ve stirred up a little bit of trouble, but don&apos;t think they had a great effect on the British scene,\u201d he says. \u201cIt&apos;s because the British don&apos;t like explicit taste, fashion and style in architecture any more. In all the other arts they go crazy for it. If FAT had been around with Lord Burlington, everyone would have listened to them.\u201d Alain de Botton agrees that their outlook represents a sadly rare approach in contemporary architectural culture. \u201cFAT look beyond technological minimalism,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are interested in beauty, which makes them extremely strange. It shouldn&apos;t, but such is the spurious orthodoxy around &apos;function&apos; that what should be common sense has come to seem peculiar and whimsical.\u201d The three partners have yet to announce their future plans, but will end their collaboration at the Venice Architecture Biennale next summer, where they are curating the British Pavilion with Dutch practice Crimson and writer Owen Hatherley. \u201cThey remain open to offers for a lucrative reunion in 20 years\u2019 time,\u201d concludes the official press release. \u201cWe&apos;ve got to go on a victory tour,\u201d grins Jacob. \u201cBands used to take 30 years to reunite, but nowadays they&apos;re back together in a couple of months, so who knows ...\u201d", "sentences": ["Conceived as a whimsical hill-town squeezed into a 19th-century church in Amsterdam, it was more outlandish than any Googleplex or Facebookworld could ever hope to be, and it included a wooden fort, a lifeguard&apos;s tower, fragments of astroturf pitches and a meeting room decked out like a fairytale forest."], "title": "The end of FAT: architecture's biggest pranksters call it quits \u2013 boyband style", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/dec/17/fat-architecture-break-up", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Art", "Grayson Perry", "Alain de Botton", "Housing", "Society", "Media", "London", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-17T18:54:10Z", "article": "In the footballing analogy supplied by Manchester City fan Sir Howard Davies in the foreword to the interim report on providing additional capacity in south-east England, his Airports Commission&apos;s work has reached half-time and, he says: &quot;This is a game of two halves.&quot; But the London mayor, Boris Johnson, seems to have wangled himself some extra time at the end of the first half, though the chances of a comeback for his team seem remote. The mayor was quick to hail the fact that an estuary option had not entirely been ruled out. But Davies described this option as &quot;imaginative&quot; and very expensive, even if he kept it on the fringes of the shortlist. Davies also rejected the chance to deny a claim, first published in the Guardian, that senior politicians lobbied to ensure he came up with more than a Heathrow-Gatwick shortlist, saying simply that\u00a0 the shortlist had not changed since his meetings with George Osborne and David Cameron. Given that context, the second half looks more or less like a straight shoot out between Heathrow and Gatwick. Heathrow is the airlines&apos; airport of choice, but expensive, and it subjects hundreds of thousands of people to its noise. Gatwick is a second on many counts now, but a runway could help even things up, at a lower social and financial cost. The classic model, in the argument made by Heathrow authorities and Johnson, is that only a hub airport will serve the UK&apos;s needs. A hub airport is one sufficiently large to allow for multiple connecting flights and passengers, factors that sustain other flights, particularly long-haul, to less popular destinations, keeping the nation connected and facilitating trade and investment with and from markets abroad. It is argued though that this model is redundant, and that the real trend is growth in low-cost point-to-point travel. People taking this position might say that new technological developments allow planes to travel further economically with fewer passengers \u2013 potentially opening up low-cost long-haul flights. Davies&apos;s choice of language when unveiling the report to the press was revealing. He did not accept parts of the argument for a hub \u2013 an orthodoxy established by those whose interests it suited, he implied. He explicitly rejected comparisons made regularly by Heathrow to European hubs, such as Frankfurt and Schiphol, Amsterdam, pointing out that London was different, a bigger city with far more destination traffic. He prefaced his remarks on Gatwick by pointing out that a specific local agreement prohibiting construction had ruled it out of consideration the last time that new runways were considered, in 2003. His mention of such phrases as &quot;lively competition&quot;, &quot;low fares&quot; and &quot;a constellation&quot; of airports must have been music to the ears of Gatwick&apos;s head, Stewart Wingate. The issue, Davies said, was now balance, not the hub or no-hub argument. It was an open question but &quot;to put all your eggs in one basket and have one huge hub strikes us as quite risky&quot;. Gatwick has new reason to look forward to the second half. Yet Davies too is only part of the wider game \u2013 and history shows that the commission&apos;s final recommendation far from guarantees that any runway is built.", "sentences": ["He explicitly rejected comparisons made regularly by Heathrow to European hubs, such as Frankfurt and Schiphol, Amsterdam, pointing out that London was different, a bigger city with far more destination traffic."], "title": "Gatwick has reason to be cheerful after Airport Commission report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/17/gatwick-airport-has-reason-to-be-cheerful", "tags": ["Heathrow third runway", "Business", "Airline industry", "Travel and transport", "London", "Heathrow", "Air transport", "Environment", "Gatwick airport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-18T08:59:00Z", "article": "Even though around a third of us live alone these days, the image of the lone diner is still quite sad.

Solitary dining can actually be an inspiring experience, because you get a chance to disconnect for a while in our hyper-connected world.&quot; Global supper clubs If you do prefer your food with company, the still-trendy supper club movement lends itself perfectly, since the intention is to share good food with interesting strangers. Finding a supper club in a strange city when you&apos;re away with work can be easier said than done, however. So, after being scooped up by a Greek local and taken home for dinner while travelling, Guy Michlin set up EatWith. It&apos;s a global supper club listing site, a little like the food version of AirB&amp;B, where locals can invite travellers to tea. The site has 400 dinner hosts in 23 different countries who offer a homecooked-from-scratch meal for a fee. Guests register to join them for food and get a taste of local culture as well as local cooking. &quot;Food is a wonderful way to create stronger connections between people,&quot; says Michlin. &quot;This is exactly what we&apos;re doing and why the EatWith movement is proving so popular across the world.&quot; Feeding your neighbours Still, spending an evening with strangers isn&apos;t everyone&apos;s cup of tea. Some of us would actually prefer to dine alone and at home, but don&apos;t want to cook for one. If that&apos;s you, there&apos;s shareyourmeal.co.uk. Working from the premise that it&apos;s cheaper and easier to make food in bulk rather than in single person portion sizes, a group of neighbours in Utrecht in the Netherlands set up a WhatsApp group where they could share food if they cooked too much. From humble beginnings it&apos;s grown into a Europe-wide meal-sharing site. Lovers of ladling out huge portions get to satisfy their urge to feed people by advertising what they&apos;re cooking. If you&apos;re nearby, you simply ask to have a portion, and go round with a container to collect it like takeaway. It&apos;s more inspiring than the singleton diet of late-night bowls of cereal, omelettes, and pasta-pesto (or is that just me?), and less wasteful than filling your fridge with food that will rot because you can&apos;t eat it all in time. Meal sharing But why would you buy food from your neighbour when you can just phone for pizza and have it delivered, you might ask? Unless you have a voracious appetite, even takeaway isn&apos;t really geared towards the lone eater. But now there&apos;s an app for that. Leftoverswap allows you to offer your uneaten takeaway to your neighbours for a small charge. After all, as their website says, &apos;99% of us don&apos;t need a second helping of beef lo mein&apos;. As long as you&apos;re not too squeamish about eating other people&apos;s cast-offs, it&apos;s one way to treat yourself on Friday night when you can&apos;t afford a full-blown takeaway. It minimises your food waste, and you get to feel good about sharing with your neighbours. Are these good ideas? Could they help make the way all of us eat less wasteful, single or not? Or do they isolate singletons further from the joys of conviviality and communal eating?", "sentences": ["Taking the shame out of the experience is the idea behind Eenmaal in Amsterdam, a recurrent pop-up restaurant, with only tables for one."], "title": "Eating alone: there's no shame in a table for one", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/dec/18/eating-alone-no-shame-lone-diner-table-takeaway", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-18T17:19:13Z", "article": "The director of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, Wim Pijbes, is being invited to join the judges of the Art Fund museum prize, giving the judging panel for the \u00a3100,000 prize \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 an international dimension for the first time.

Although there has been a steady increase of tension with Europe and the US, leading to a number of crisis points, the Kremlin has been able to score a number of diplomatic victories, many of them utterly unexpected. From the extraordinary effort that saw Putin take to the pages of the New York Times as the voice of restraint and international law, persuading the US not to launch a military attack on Syria and succeeding in getting a dubious plan to remove chemical weapons from the country off the ground, to the equally surreal spectacle of Russia taking the moral high ground over surveillance and spying by sheltering Edward Snowden from the long arm of US retribution, the Kremlin has scored points in the unlikeliest of places. As the year drew to a close, Putin pulled off another spectacular, prising neighbouring Ukraine from the embrace of the European Union and yanking it back towards Moscow. At a summit in Crimea in September, the Kremlin&apos;s point man on Ukraine spewed dark threats about what would happen if Ukraine ignored Russia, and was laughed out of the room. Two months later, his wishes were fulfilled. It&apos;s almost funny when you think about it \u2013 all those European bureaucrats beavering away over the minutiae of the trade deal, and then along comes Putin with a sack of cash and scuppers the whole thing in a matter of minutes. Not even a sack of cash, in fact, but the promise of a sack of cash. And indeed, not so much as the promise of a sack of cash, but the threat of a lack of a sack of cash in the case of noncompliance. Whether any of these things will actually prove to be long-lasting victories, or whether they are merely point-scoring that will bring Russia more headaches in the long run, is an open question. What the Russians lack is soft power, as the response on the streets of Ukraine to news of the deal illustrated again. Even with the disasters that have befallen the EU in recent years, it turns out that moving closer to Brussels is still an attractive prospect for many in eastern Europe, as a symbolic aspiration and a beacon of values, whereas the Kremlin&apos;s icy embrace simply is not. More generally, relations with the US and Europe spiralled, with the values gap ever bigger and the rhetoric on both sides ever more spiky, while still refraining from going entirely over the precipice. The US banned Russian officials implicated in the death of whistleblowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky from travelling to America; Russia, aware that a reciprocal ban would hardly be devastating for US officials, added in a ban on the adoption of Russian orphans by US citizens for good measure. The Russia-Netherlands year of culture was marred by all manner of political obstacles. Putin was booed and jeered over Russia&apos;s controversial new anti-gay legislation when he travelled to Amsterdam,the countries traded accusations that their respective deputy ambassadors were beaten up in each others&apos; capital cities, and the Netherlands took Russia to an international tribunal over its seizure of the Dutch-flagged Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise. Britain should watch out \u2013 2014 is the Russia-UK year of culture. At home, Putin has pulled back from a full-scale crackdown, with laws branding NGOs as &quot;foreign agents&quot; only partially implemented, opposition leader Alexei Navalny spared jail and allowed to run in Moscow mayoral elections, and no mass arrests of opponents, though harsh trials of those arrested after a Moscow protest the day before his inauguration drag on interminably. The so-called Bolotnaya protesters receive little media attention, but the Kremlin has been genuinely shocked by the negative publicity that its laws against &quot;homosexual propaganda&quot; have received, and is furious that the gay issue could dominate Putin&apos;s pet project, the Sochi Olympics in February.", "sentences": ["Putin was booed and jeered over Russia&apos;s controversial new anti-gay legislation when he travelled to Amsterdam,the countries traded accusations that their respective deputy ambassadors were beaten up in each others&apos; capital cities, and the Netherlands took Russia to an international tribunal over its seizure of the Dutch-flagged Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise."], "title": "Guardian Weekly year in review 2013: Vladimir Putin keeps Russia in an icy embrace", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/dec/19/guardian-weekly-year-review-2013-russia", "tags": ["Russia", "Vladimir Putin", "Ukraine", "Viktor Yanukovych", "Europe", "European Union", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-19T16:52:58Z", "article": "Driving home for Christmas will this year involve far fewer tailbacks than normal, motoring organisations predict, with midweek bank holidays ensuring a staggered getaway from Friday until Christmas Eve. Traffic will be heaviest on Friday evening, with the M25 likely to see the longest delays while wet and windy weather in the north may make driving conditions difficult. But with many people expected to take a fortnight off, the getaway rush should be lighter than usual, the AA said. An estimated \u00a32bn is being spent on travel to friends and families, while the RAC predicts that 13 million people will take to the road between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day. Traffic jams to shopping destinations are expected to be at their heaviest on Saturday. The Highways Agency said 300 miles of roadworks on motorways and major roads will be completed by Monday, with work suspended on another 86 miles. Works will remain in place at 21 locations, including the M4 near Slough, the M6 near Birmingham, the M1 in Yorkshire, and a northern stretch of the M25. Network Rail is planning \u00a3110m of works over the holiday period. It said that the vast majority will not significantly affect travel, with the exception of the London-Brighton main line, including Gatwick Airport station. The works mean Gatwick Express and First Capital Connect services south to the airport will not operate from 25 December to 1 January \u2013 adding up to 90 minutes to train journey times between the capital and the airport on alternative routes. National Express coaches will be the only large-scale public transport alternative to reach Gatwick, as well as Heathrow, over the Christmas bank holidays. The company predicted coach travel would be at its busiest on 23 and 27 December. Elsewhere, some First Great Western, CrossCountry, Northern Rail, South West, and Southeastern train services will be disrupted by engineering works between Christmas and New Year. Some rail services will run on Boxing Day with an eye on shoppers in London and out-of-town outlets, with Chiltern rail and Southeastern high-speed trains running limited services. The London underground closes from late Christmas Eve but reopens with a reduced service on Boxing Day. The capital&apos;s congestion charge will be suspended from 25 December to 1 January. Around 4 million Britons will travel overseas for the Christmas break, the majority leaving this weekend for winter sun or skiing, with many also planning new year city breaks in Europe, according to travel organisation Abta.

If ever a house embodied one of the strangest and most enduring characters of children&apos;s literature, it is Clive King&apos;s. The author of Stig of the Dump doesn&apos;t exactly live like a rubbish-tip dwelling caveman \u2013 as far as I can tell, King&apos;s water supply is not acquired via a bicycle mudguard feeding rainwater through a vacuum cleaner tube into an old can of weedkiller \u2013 but it is easy to see from where his stone-age creation acquired his ingenuity. Like Stig, who is 50 years old this year, King was an exemplar of\u00a0recycling long before it became fashionable. Other social trends and attitudes examined by the 89-year-old author in the 16 books he has written for young people have also resurfaced as contemporary concerns. King&apos;s ability to be some years ahead of\u00a0current thinking on everything from\u00a0immigration to hunting may be one reason why Stig is still in print, and\u00a0perhaps more pertinent than ever. King, who lives a somewhat ascetic existence with his second wife, Penny, in their mostly self-built home on the edge of a Norfolk marsh, has never enjoyed enormous acclaim. A slow-burning success, Stig of the Dump missed out on the Carnegie Medal when it was published in 1963 and failed to win the &quot;Puffin of Puffins&quot; (which went\u00a0to Eoin Colfer&apos;s modern bestseller Artemis Fowl) when the children&apos;s imprint celebrated its 70th birthday three years ago.     Stig of the Dump by Clive King    But recognition, in a\u00a0variety of forms, may be belatedly arriving. King&apos;s\u00a0best-known book is the subject of\u00a0a Radio 4 documentary, Stig at Fifty, to be broadcast on Christmas Day and\u00a0Stig will also be read by Andrew Lincoln on Radio 4 Extra in the week after Christmas. This year King was also belatedly awarded an Arctic Cross\u00a0medal for his role in the Arctic convoys, the naval operation to ship goods to Russia during the second world war, which was described by\u00a0Churchill as &quot;the worst journey in\u00a0the\u00a0world&quot;. The recognition that every author craves, however, is simply being read, and King has always had that in abundance. He still receives fan mail posing questions that he has been asked for six decades \u2013 Is Stig real? Is\u00a0the chalk pit real? Everyone from Hugh Bonneville to David Walliams has\u00a0cited Stig of the Dump as an inspiration but it\u00a0is not just a book beloved of boys\u00a0of a\u00a0certain vintage (for\u00a0whom &quot;Stig&quot; was a schoolyard insult). Fiona Reynolds, former director general of the National Trust and a key player in the charity&apos;s campaign for a &quot;natural childhood&quot;, is\u00a0also a fan and many young readers still enjoy the book for its vivid dramatisation of that universal childhood experience \u2013 &quot;believing in something that no one else believes in,&quot; as my 12-year-old niece puts it. The story of eight-year-old Barney, who tumbles into a rubbish-strewn chalk pit and befriends Stig, strikingly illustrates how child&apos;s play has been transformed over the past five decades. Few eight-year-olds today are likely to\u00a0experience this sort of outdoor adventure: Barney wanders off for whole days alone without adults worrying about him, hanging out in a\u00a0dump that would now be fenced off. But King thinks one reason his manuscript was rejected by 12 publishers was because its portrayal of\u00a0children roaming free was already frowned upon in the 60s. &quot;It was beginning to be rather improper to let\u00a0a\u00a0child run wild like that,&quot; he says. King based Barney&apos;s experiences in\u00a0the chalk pit on his own explorations of the dump by his parents&apos; home close\u00a0to the village of Ash on the North\u00a0Downs of Kent in the 1930s, and\u00a0watching his own son, nicknamed Barney, do the same two decades later. &quot;My experience of the chalk pit was doubly enforced \u2013 I saw it through my own eyes and I saw it through the eyes of my children,&quot; he says. &quot;Of course there wasn&apos;t actually a stone-age man living in a cave at the bottom of it, but Ash was a very boring place to live and I thought what it needs is something to\u00a0wake it up, so I invented Stig.&quot; It would be easy for a portrait of a\u00a0stone-age man written in the 1960s to\u00a0make a contemporary reader cringe but, re-reading Stig of the Dump as an adult, I was struck by the sensitivity of\u00a0King&apos;s portrayal of not just the imaginative interior life of a young boy but also of a caveman of\u00a0indeterminate age whose &quot;hands looked cleverer than\u00a0his face&quot;. King believes this may be because of\u00a0his itinerant postwar career in the British Council, which saw him work in\u00a0Amsterdam, Belfast, Aleppo, Damascus, Beirut, Dhaka and Madras. &quot;I have travelled quite a lot and I have met so-called &apos;primitive&apos; people abroad. They are not primitive people, they are not so different from us,&quot; he says. King studied 10 languages during his career and perhaps he also mastered the inner language of children \u2013 and stone-age\u00a0man. Ever since he wrote a play based on\u00a0Winnie-the-Pooh as a young boy, AA\u00a0Milne has been an inspiration. When King was posted on HMS Farnham Castle, part of the Arctic convoys, he was made the ship&apos;s correspondence officer and kept his captain awake with bashing his typewriter. Shortly after his ship changed positions in the convoy, the boat that took its place, HMS Lapwing, was torpedoed, killing 158. &quot;I may have\u00a0sunk a German submarine. That\u00a0was my job,&quot; says King. More than\u00a03,000 men lost their lives in the Arctic convoys. After the war, King travelled with the British Council but only began writing books for children when he had a son and a daughter, Charles and Sue, who were the inspiration for Barney and Lou in Stig. &quot;I didn&apos;t really force my own writings on them but I listened to my\u00a0children, &apos;Barney and Lou&apos;, mostly fighting,&quot; he\u00a0says. During the writing of\u00a0Stig, which took three years, King would constantly ask himself, would his children understand this language? &quot;When I strayed into adult language, I\u00a0could see they didn&apos;t ever understand it.&quot; Does it help to have children as a writer of fiction for young\u00a0people? &quot;I\u00a0think it&apos;s almost essential,&quot; he says. King&apos;s literary career began with a\u00a0jolly book for younger children about a Syrian golden hamster called Hamid when he lived in\u00a0Aleppo, which was published in America. More books followed but his agent dispatched Stig to six publishers in Britain and six in the US before Kaye Webb, the influential and charismatic editor at Puffin Books, took a chance on its dog-eared manuscript. &quot;Its success as a book and my success as a writer owes a lot to Kaye Webb,&quot; says King. He was oblivious to\u00a0its gradual success. Some time after\u00a0Stig&apos;s publication, King went to the Puffin offices for a meeting and someone passed him in a corridor and\u00a0congratulated him on his million. &quot;I\u00a0said, &apos;What?&apos; Puffin had already sold\u00a0a million. It had taken off and I\u00a0hadn&apos;t realised it.&quot; The success of Stig has overshadowed King&apos;s 16 other novels for children, including The 22 Letters, an ambitious historical adventure about three brothers who devise an early alphabet, and Ninny&apos;s Boat, a prescient historical drama set in an era\u00a0when the English are the newest illegal immigrants. This\u00a0latter book was inspired by King&apos;s experience of Vietnamese boat people while working in Pakistan and was set in his adopted home of East Anglia. King feels that The 22 Letters &quot;deserved more promotion and didn&apos;t get it&quot; and\u00a0also slightly regrets the way he has\u00a0been received. &quot;In my day, they didn&apos;t take children&apos;s writers seriously. They\u00a0didn&apos;t really review them, they just retold the story.&quot; But he turns schoolmasterly-stern when I ask which of his novels is his favourite. &quot;Do you have brothers and sisters? It&apos;s like asking your parents which is their favourite child. We don&apos;t have favourites.&quot; Stig&apos;s success finally enabled him to\u00a0become a full-time writer, aged 50. Not\u00a0long afterwards, he moved to his\u00a0current home in Norfolk. What brought him here? &quot;My feet,&quot; he says. It is not exactly a joke. The Stig sales did not make him rich. In fact, King was so impoverished that he once walked across London from his former\u00a0home in Camden Town to Shepherd&apos;s Bush to discuss a\u00a0script with the BBC because he couldn&apos;t afford the bus fare. When he retired from the British Council to write, he and Penny drew a circle 100 miles from\u00a0Charing Cross and explored \u2013 by\u00a0walking - places like Dorset, Offa&apos;s\u00a0Dyke and East Anglia. In\u00a0Norfolk, they discovered a cottage\u00a0with no electricity\u00a0or running water, lying below sea level and earmarked for demolition. It appealed. &quot;We&apos;re in the middle of three rivers and we reckoned it wasn&apos;t going to get built up, not while we were there,&quot; he\u00a0says. &quot;It had all this shoreline. Offa&apos;s\u00a0Dyke is\u00a0too much inland. I feel smothered. Here I feel a\u00a0sense of relief. I&apos;m a claustrophobe, definitely a claustrophobe, and I like the wide open spaces.&quot; He no longer writes novels and is frustrated that his memory for words is\u00a0going, not helped by Parkinson&apos;s. But\u00a0this year he wrote a piece for Ladybird Books about his wartime memories and also two wedding speeches, one for his youngest daughter and another for the musician\u00a0who helps with his garden. He still reads constantly, and currently has Lincoln by David Herbert Donald on the go. In the era of JK Rowling we assume that all successful children&apos;s authors are\u00a0wealthy, but King is sanguine about his\u00a0relative lack of riches, and the way most writers have to take other work to\u00a0support themselves. &quot;Look at Dickens. He wrote a lot of books, yes, but probably spent more time touring America and giving lectures. It&apos;s either that or going back to the days of patrons.&quot; While his travels with the British Council provided many settings for his stories, he regrets that writing was not more central to his working life. &quot;I wish I&apos;d spent more time writing than earning my daily bread,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m one of the lucky ones. When people say, &apos;how do you become a famous writer?&apos; I don&apos;t know, but when the opportunity arises you&apos;ve got to jump to it.&quot; King did that, but he still got distracted, not least by rebuilding the cottage. &quot;I had been pushed around and provided with flats to live\u00a0in for 20 years or so by the British Council. Even then, I should&apos;ve been writing books rather than converting a\u00a0house.&quot; King has witnessed the decline in\u00a0wild play \u2013 and reading books \u2013 through his own seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. &quot;They are quite proud of me, they say, a famous author. But I don&apos;t think my grandchildren or\u00a0great-grandchildren read very many books. I\u00a0don&apos;t feel sad. I\u00a0think it&apos;s inevitable. Children these days like gadgets.&quot; The ultimate symbol of the way so much of our wild landscape is closed off to children now is the fate of King&apos;s old chalk pit. It is now a golf course \u2013 another slice of wild land, another potential playground for the imagination, sealed off and sanitised. &quot;I&apos;ve not been back for a long time,&quot; says King, firmly. &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t want to go\u00a0back.&quot; \u2022 Stig at Fifty is broadcast on Radio 4 at 7.30am on Christmas morning and again at 10.30pm on 28\u00a0December", "sentences": ["King believes this may be because of\u00a0his itinerant postwar career in the British Council, which saw him work in\u00a0Amsterdam, Belfast, Aleppo, Damascus, Beirut, Dhaka and Madras."], "title": "Clive King: 'Ash was a boring place.

I know about this place partly because I live in Paris and I am a frequent Eurostar traveller, and partly because this is where Google sent me when I typed in the request &quot;Where to find heroin in Paris&quot;. Apparently the most popular spot for dealing is the rue Ambroise-Par\u00e9 which contains a series of entrances to underground car parks where users can shoot up in relative privacy. The place permanently stinks of piss and is under constant police surveillance, as dealers and clients scurry back and forth between their hiding places. You can watch all of this action, nibbling on a snack and sipping champagne, from the front end of the Eurostar VIP Lounge which backs on to the street. In fact although there are plenty of drugs around the Gare du Nord there is not much real heroin. Most popular with the young homeless population is a substitute called skenan, capsules of morphine sulphate. Aside from skenan, or alongside it, these young people, and older raddled boozers, drink Viking-strength lagers which smell even from a distance like pure ethanol. According to real heroin lovers, in contrast, the best drugs supermarket in this part of town is half a mile away down in Chateau Rouge and Strasbourg Saint-Denis. Actually, I am told that you could probably find heroin in most parts of the city if you look hard enough, but this particular area has a long tradition of busy criminality and a reputation for being relatively police-free. I should say from the outset I am not a heroin user and I only really began to find out about the Parisian drug scene a few months ago when, with my friend and producer Geoff Bird, I started to write a documentary for Radio 4 called Heroin. In this programme we wanted to investigate the contribution, positive or negative, that heroin had made to 20th-century culture. Our starting point was that the beneficial effects of hallucinogenics (mainly pot and acid) on our culture are now a widely acknowledged fact. Despite their dangers \u2013 which are many \u2013 no one could deny that the works of Bob Dylan, the Beatles or Syd Barrett, and countless others, have been enhanced by the electric glow of the psychedelic experience. No one, however has ever seriously argued that heroin too can unlock creativity, albeit in a very different way. We went to Berlin and Paris, mainly because heroin has been a crucial part of their identity. At no point did we wish to glamorise or promote the drug; it was a given that in these cities countless lives had been wrecked by heroin. In the first instance, though, we spoke to heroin users who were unashamed about their habit. Some of them even said that heroin made them better people. This lack of secrecy and guilt is most visible on the internet, where there is now a proliferation of blogs and websites where, like any other consumers, heroin users compare prices, quality, the &quot;taste&quot; and purity of the product. The knock-on effect of this is that, wherever you live, it is easy these days to launch a quick Google search, as I did in Paris, and find a variety of locations and prices, pretty much as if you were looking for a niche restaurant or a specialist club. These days in the cheerfully &quot;out&quot; international heroin community, users contact each other and talk about heroin rather as if it were a fine wine. In New York City, some heroin lovers have gone as far as collecting the tiny bags in which the drug is sold. The speciality of New York and Brooklyn is that these bags are often stapled with a sharp, satirical imprint from the dealer \u2013 &quot;Starbucks&quot; is popular, as are &quot;Lazyboy&quot;, &quot;Happy Hours&quot;, &quot;No Exit&quot; and &quot;Osama bin Laden&quot;. In recent years, collections of these bags have been exhibited at galleries in the Lower East Side, just as if they were entirely legitimate works of art. Actually, in many ways, that&apos;s what they are \u2013 the true artistic ephemera of the streets of New York. Most people in Britain have never seen, let alone knowingly used &quot;heroin&apos; \u2013 which is simply the street name of diamorphine, the most powerful painkiller known to man and still widely used by doctors. Although diamorphine was invented in Britain in the 1870s, by two chemists working in Manchester and London, it was first patented in the 1900s in Germany by the Bayer Company of Elberfeld, which promoted it as a non-addictive cough suppressant and called this new medicine heroin from the German heroisch (heroic) \u2013 the first users claimed that this was how it made them feel. According to the blogs, the quality of heroin in the UK these days is not that good \u2013 it is generally estimated to be between 10-20% of purity as compared with US-quality of up to 60%. The main two types are white, the strongest form, from Asia, and brown. It&apos;s much easier to find brown \u2013 a rougher lower-grade from Afghanistan, which according to one user looks like &quot;deep-fried Coca-Cola&quot;. Heroin is, however, still basically a form of morphine \u2013 the &quot;heroin&quot; effect is created by the way in which the drug accelerates the release of morphine into the brain. Anybody who has ever suffered extreme pain, from a heart attack to cancer, will have encountered this drug and been grateful for the way it kills their pain. For all the powerful taboos around the drug, it&apos;s also worth pointing out that if they die in hospital, most people reading this article will end their lives \u2013 just like the street junkies of Paris \u2013 on heroin.     Christiane Felscherinow today. Photograph: Arne Dedert/Corbis    Christiane Felscherinow is seated very comfortably in a plush sofa in the office of her publishers. We are on the second floor of a slightly rundown apartment building in the Charlottenberg district of Berlin; Christiane is a handsome woman of 51, with startlingly clear eyes and a ready smile. She is also the most famous heroin addict in Germany, if not Europe, and is rumoured to be still on the stuff. When I ask her if this is true she becomes giggly, girlish and evasive. &quot;How can I say anything bad about heroin?&quot; she says, not quite answering the question. &quot;Heroin has made me rich. It has made me famous. The other week I travelled on David Bowie&apos;s private plane. All of this because of heroin!&quot; It&apos;s hard to tell how much irony is at work here; my bad German and her approximate English don&apos;t always quite meet in the middle. An interpreter, Sonia Vukovic, is on hand to help out but it&apos;s still not easy to see what Christiane really means. But then her eyes flash with anger. &quot;I love heroin, and I hate it,&quot; she says, &quot;But it has been my life \u2013 so what can I say?&quot; This is true. In 1978, at the age of 16, she appeared in a West Berlin court as a witness. By then she had been a heroin addict and prostitute for three years. Two journalists for Stern magazine, Horst Rieck and Kai Hermann, shocked by her appearance and demeanour, interviewed her for two hours after the trial. The interviews then went on for months and eventually Christiane&apos;s story became a book Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo (The Children of Bahnhof Zoo). This was the harrowing but compelling tale not only of how Christiane became a heroin addict, but of a whole generation of children in West Berlin who were dying in a heroin epidemic. Christiane&apos;s tale shocked Germany and went on to become a bestseller across Europe. In 1981, it became a film, Christiane F, featuring David Bowie (one of Felscherinow&apos;s idols). I remember going to see the film with my younger sister Dawn at the Odeon in Liverpool. We both came out shell-shocked at the horror story that was Christiane&apos;s life. Now Felscherinow has published a second book, Mein zweites Leben (My Second Life), which tells the story of how life didn&apos;t necessarily get better after she got famous \u2013 there was prison, hepatitis, broken love affairs. Does she have no regrets? &quot;No, not at all,&quot; she says. &quot;This is my life and who I am. How can I regret who I am? Heroin is part of who I am too, so how can I regret it?&quot; As she says this, she looks both cheeky and fun and I wonder if the misery of her story had been exaggerated a little. &quot;Oh no,&quot; she says, eyes still twinkling, &quot;it was very hard. But then West Berlin was very hard then. And you had to have a sense of humour to stay alive. You had to have a hard sense of humour.&quot; It&apos;s easy to forget what a weird and seedy place West Berlin was in the 1970s and 1980s. This was a place cut off both from western Europe and the east. You had to travel hundreds of miles across East Germany on an autobahn corridor just to get there. It attracted every kind of draft dodger, druggie and dropout from West Germany. Once they got there hardly anybody ever left. This was partly because the place was flooded with hard drugs, mainly heroin, allegedly made in illegal labs in the east. If you were a young person in West Berlin in the 1970s and 1980s it was very hard not to come into contact with these drugs, or end up like Christiane F.     Nick Cave in Berlin, 1986. Photograph: Peter Anderson/Peter Anderson/The Hell Gate/Corbis    Mark Reeder left Manchester in 1978 for West Berlin and has been there ever since, working as a musician and record producer. He worked for a while representing Factory Records and Joy Division, and recalls the band&apos;s first visits to the city (&quot;they were fascinated by all the bullet-holes,&quot; he says). He also has seen the effect that heroin had on the city and its culture. After Factory he worked with the likes of Lydia Lunch, Rowland S Howard and the circle around Nick Cave, who claimed that he came to West Berlin in the 1980s to get off the stuff but found it here cheaper and purer than anywhere else in Europe. &quot;That was the problem,&quot; says Reeder, &quot;there was so much good heroin in West Berlin that it was a struggle to stay alive. There were a lot of artistic people, German and Anglos, but everyone was wasted. It was all bands could do to play a gig, get paid and then get destroyed on smack.&quot; He goes on to describe the effects of the occasional heroin famine on the culture of the city. Heroin withdrawal normally lasts 72 hours and can be the cruellest kind of torture. &quot;You would see people like zombies, the city would go into shutdown, and the clubs were just full of the living dead waiting for a fix. The music would get angrier and more violent. You can hear the tension in any of the bands around then \u2013 just listen to Nick Cave&apos;s early stuff with the Birthday Party or the Bad Seeds.&quot;     David Bowie at the Berlin Wall, 1987. Photograph: Denis O'Regan/Getty Images    We took a walk together in the Sch\u00f6neberg district of the city, ending up on Genthiner Strasse. This was where the Sound Discoth\u00e8que was in the 1970s, one of the few nightclubs then in West Berlin, and where Christiane and her generation first discovered heroin. &quot;What shocked me when I got here from Manchester was first of all the kind of music they had here,&quot; says Reeder as we stroll past the place where the Sound once was (now a furniture store). &quot;Back in the UK in the late 70s everyone was popping amphetamines and jumping around to punk. But here people were just sitting cross-legged, listening to Tangerine Dream or Klaus Schulze, sort of drone, dream music. The other was the drugs. I had never seen heroin in Manchester, or knew anyone who took it. It was for the Rolling Stones, not the likes of us. Here in Berlin it was everywhere, and everyone was on it.&quot; In some ways, since the fall of the Wall, West Berlin has changed less than East Berlin, where there at least has been a housing boom. Parts of the city are indeed pretty much intact from the bleak and sleazy past. Leaving the ghost of the Sound, we turn left into what was called the Babystrich \u2013 this is the strip outside the Sound where Christiane and her mates sold their bodies for smack. Things round here can&apos;t have changed much since then \u2013 on a blustery Tuesday morning young east European-looking girls are already flagging down cars. Reeder&apos;s theory, and I believe him, is that West Berlin in the 1970s and 1980s was probably the most fucked-up city in Europe, suffering from the catastrophe of a war that didn&apos;t quite seem to be over and the deep psychic trauma of being lost between east and west. Eventually, the likes of Iggy Pop and David Bowie gave Berlin an international visibility as a glamorous and decadent location, but all of this was on the surface. &quot;Everything then was chaos,&quot; says Felscherinow, not without a touch of nostalgia. &quot;You could live how you wanted. You could get it when you wanted. That was West Berlin. It was never easy to live here, but that was the point.&quot; This sounded to me like a painful way to live. &quot;Yes you can say that,&quot; she says, her eyes now focused on her cigarette. &quot;We lived in pain. We had withdrawals a lot and so we suffered a lot. We were masochists. This was a city in pain.&quot; The Hotel de Lauzun on the Ile Saint-Louis, could not be further removed from the grey streets of Berlin or indeed the grimy streets of the Gare du Nord, less than half an hour&apos;s walk away.     Charles Baudelaire, photographed in 1866. Photograph: Apic/Getty Images    The building is set on the north bank of the island, in a dreamy setting where the Seine laps lazily against its banks, and you can barely make out the sounds of the 21st-century city. It is indeed little changed from the 1840s, when the poet Charles Baudelaire lived here. This is where he began composing the book that would become known as Les Fleurs du Mal (The Flowers of Evil) \u2013 a compendium of poems on satanism, lesbianism, sex, death and revolt which would eventually be prosecuted on grounds of blasphemy on publication in 1857 (six of the poems remained banned until 1949). This is also where the Parisian tradition of using opium in the name of artistic inspiration began. With his friend and fellow poet Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Baudelaire was a founder member of the Club des Hachichins \u2013 an elite group of intellectuals and spiritual adventurers (the club also included the painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and the poet G\u00e9rard de Nerval). They took drugs in pursuit of what they called &quot;fantasias&quot; \u2013 collective and individual experiences of the altered state. Baudelaire was an avid reader (and translator) of Thomas de Quincey&apos;s Confessions of an English Opium Eater of 1821. As such, his sensibility was gripped by opium, which was administered to him as a chewy paste by a certain Dr Moreau, who had travelled in the Orient and was curious about the effect of this narcotic on the cultivated western mind. This was not quite as intense as heroin, but it had a similar impact on the mind and body. Baudelaire described how it could &quot;expand beyond all measures, stretch out the limitless, make rapture bottomless&quot;. This is a fairly accurate description of what opium or heroin does when it hits the opioid-receptors in the brain. The drug did not give Baudelaire visions or hallucinations, even if he had wished for them; instead, it threw him into a profound meditation which detached him from the world and made him understand it more clearly.     Chet Baker in the 50s. Photograph: Lebrecht/Corbis    The Parisian tradition of opiate usage reached its zenith in the 1950s when black jazz musicians flocked to Paris, fleeing the racism of the United States, and finding in Paris cheap and good-quality heroin. The heroin in Paris then came from Indochina, via Turkey, and was brought into Marseille by the Corsican gangs who would later be known as the French Connection. The ultimate destination for much of this stuff was the United States, but cosmopolitan Paris too provided a ready market. The drug arrived as morphine paste and was made into heroin in illegal laboratories in Marseille. The first wave of these laboratories was shut down in 1937; but after the second world war it was rumoured that the French and American authorities colluded in keeping the trade alive, partly to allow the gangsters to keep the powerful communists out of the port of Marseille. Either way, the French Connection grew ever more powerful and finally the stuff of myth and movies (the best of which is French Connection II, where Gene Hackman plays a dissolute New York cop at war with the Marseille gangsters). In Paris, jazz musicians celebrated heroin for the way in which it enabled them to hit the peaks of &quot;transcendent relaxation&quot; in their being and their music \u2013 this was the aesthetics of &quot;cool&quot;. You can hear this work, for example, in the playing of the young Chet Baker. This was a man who was once so handsome that he was described as the &quot;James Dean of the trumpet&quot;. By the time he died in 1988 \u2013 he fell to his death from an Amsterdam window, loaded on heroin and cocaine \u2013 he had a face like a crumpled sack. Baker came to Paris in the mid-50s and indulged in all the heroin that was on offer. This is when he began to develop his distinctive style \u2013 the gentle, spiralling melancholy which is like listening to someone floating in space. This was the same sensation described by Scottish poet Alexander Trocchi as the &quot;wonderful healing effect&quot; of heroin. Like Baker, Trocchi arrived in Paris in the 1950s \u2013 he came from Glasgow with the aim of making a literary career. Then in his early 20s, he was brilliant at everything \u2013 writing, editing, talking, seducing women. But above all Trocchi loved heroin. Before long, he declared that he &quot;had decided to make a career out of it&quot;. It was also about this time that Trocchi encountered Guy Debord, who later became famous as the leader of the avant-garde group known as the Situationist International and the author of the massively influential book The Society of the Spectacle. Trocchi fell immediately under his spell. Debord in turn believed in Trocchi as an active &quot;situationist&quot;, that is to say someone whose life was a form of serious play. Trocchi himself called shooting up an act of &quot;systematic nihilism&quot; which &quot;threw a purposive spoon into the broth of experience&quot;. He describes this in beautifully lucid prose. &quot;Half an hour ago I gave myself a fix,&quot; Trocchi wrote, &quot;I stood the needle and the eye dropper in a glass of cold water and lay down on the bunk\u2026 The mind under heroin evades perception as it does ordinarily; one is aware only of contents. But that the whole way of posing the question, of dividing the mind from what it&apos;s aware of, is fruitless. Nor is it that objects of perception are intrusive in an electric way as they are under mescalin or lysergic acid\u2026 It is that the perceiving turns inward, the eyelids droop, the blood is aware of itself.&quot;     Alexander Trocchi and his second wife, Lyn. Photograph: Camera Press Digital    For the sense of inviolability, some Americans have used the word &quot;cool&quot;. For Trocchi, using heroin was the route to creating a new form of human being; he described himself as &quot;a cosmonaut of inner space&quot;, exploring unknown frontiers on behalf of the rest of mankind. When, in 1957, Trocchi was arrested in New York on drug charges, Debord and the situationists leapt vigorously to his defence with a pamphlet called &quot;Hands Off Alex Trocchi!&quot; where they described him &quot;as a new type of artist&quot;. Trocchi is, however, only one of a long line of artists who have developed a philosophy of heroin use in Paris. One of the minor literary hits on the Parisian scene in recent months has been a biography of actor-journalist Alain Pacadis, the &quot;punk dandy&quot; who presided over Le Palace, the nightclub that was the Studio 54 of Paris in the 1980s. Pacadis held a doctorate from the Sorbonne and styled himself a &quot;junkie existentialist&quot;. He modelled himself on, among others, Robert Malaval, an artist admired and encouraged by Dal\u00ed, who described himself as a &quot;suicide of the art world&quot;, and who deliberately overdosed on heroin in 1980 while listening to Richard Hell&apos;s punk anthem Blank Generation. He died in his luxurious apartment on the rue du Pont-Louis-Philippe, yards away from the Hotel de Lauzun. In his suicide note he wrote that his overdose was his &quot;gift to the future&quot;. The French singer Daniel Darc, who died of an overdose in February, spoke about how his heroin addiction placed him in a pantheon of French users, who from Baudelaire to Pacadis, via Artaud, Cocteau and the surrealists, have taken drugs not to expand the mind but to travel deeper into what Georges Bataille called the inner experience \u2013 the complete collapse of the ego into the limitless space of the universe, the &quot;rapture bottomless&quot; of Baudelaire. If heroin in Berlin is a product of history and politics, it seems then that heroin use in Paris has been a more self-consciously intellectual affair. I put this to Will Self, who is sitting in my office in Paris. Self rarely or never discusses heroin these day, and in particular his own 14 years of heroin use. This is partly because he&apos;s bored by it, and partly because he is wary of the cultural slumming that goes with the territory. But Self is not just a novelist but also a professor of contemporary thought at Brunel University. As such he is willing to talk ideas for Radio 4. &quot;I think the relationship between heroin and cities, or cityspace, is very interesting,&quot; he says. &quot;It has more to do with spatiality, how the inner world of the user connects with the outside word of reality. And what we&apos;re really talking about is the psychogeography of heroin. William Burroughs knew this when he wrote The Naked Lunch, the great heroin novel set in the Interzone of Tangier, and Lou Reed knew this. The first Velvet Underground album is essentially a day in the life of a heroin addict in New York City, and a map of where he goes and what he sees and what he feels. And the music sounds like heroin, with its drones and impatient feedback and stuttering words. It&apos;s the perfect soundtrack to the junkie life. There is a heroin psychogeography \u2013 where to find it, where to buy it, where you can smell it.&quot; He goes on: &quot;The point is that heroin users occupy a certain negative space in the world, in society. Burroughs writes in The Naked Lunch how, strung out in Tangier, he could sit and look at his shoe for eight hours. Heroin users don&apos;t need to do anything or go anywhere: they just are.&quot; This above all is what makes the heroin user a threat to a society built on speed and movement. Heroin, in contrast, makes the individual deeply introspective. Beyond the &quot;dirty junkie&quot; cliches and the fear of disease, one of the reasons why heroin is still taboo is that it wipes away the sense of responsibility to the collective, to the herd. This is why heroin users are usually characterised as self-destructive narcissists who don&apos;t really deserve to survive their habits. But it is clear that artists who are heroin users have a clearly developed sense of negativity in relation to society, and that has its own aesthetic. This indeed is the true art of heroin \u2013 to refuse life, to refuse society; terrifyingly, in every absolute sense: to just say &quot;no&quot;.

In his final year, his teacher told him he had to choose \u2013 either to be a church baritone, or take jazz more seriously. &quot;I compromised: I ended up on cruise ships.&quot; Since then, he&apos;s found a regular gig playing for Alex Horne on The Horne Section, the comedian&apos;s cabaret show which has toured the UK and picked up two series on Radio 4; Stilgoe&apos;s inclination to combine jazz and comedy has, however, caused a certain sniffiness in some quarters. &quot;You trace the lineage back through George Melly, Dudley Moore, Georgie Fame \u2026 all these people who were brilliant musicians but because they liked to give people a good time the jazz establishment were like: &apos;You&apos;re on your own.&apos; To be taken seriously in jazz is both quite difficult and perhaps not as important as it first seems.&quot; His latest album is a live recording of his shows at the London Jazz festival that combined his great love of film scores and soundtracks with his own movie-inspired numbers. It includes his favourite of his own songs \u2013 That&apos;s The Way It Crumbles, Cookie-Wise, titled after a line from his all-time favourite film, The Apartment. &quot;It&apos;s all about that build-up of complete desire and untrammelled longing for someone and knowing that person is right for you if only they would realise it,&quot; he explains, adding that he&apos;d just written it when he met his future wife, Katie, in Edinburgh two years ago. &quot;I played the song when she came to see my show, and I hoped that at that moment she&apos;d fall in love with me. But I couldn&apos;t read my watch, and although my show was called One Hour I ended up coming off 20 minutes early. Everyone was going \u2013 is that it?

The boss of Nats, Britain&apos;s air traffic control service, had a nightmare start to the festive season two weeks ago when a computer glitch at Nats&apos; \u00a3623m Swanwick base in Hampshire caused delays to hundreds of flights. With millions of people leaving and arriving in Britain over Christmas and New Year, Nats needs things to run smoothly. Flights peaked at about 5,800 on Friday and Heathrow expects 1.5 million passengers to take off and land at the UK&apos;s busiest airport from Christmas Eve to New Year&apos;s Day. Deakin offers no guarantee against further Nats-induced delays but says the software problem that caused chaos on 7 December will not recur. &quot;That last event was a one-in-10-year event and that particular system is fixed. That system isn&apos;t going to fall over. As you can imagine, it&apos;s had a bit of attention. We&apos;re not proud of the disruption we caused people. Everyone at Nats was working flat out from the small hours of the morning to minimise the impact.&quot; He adds: &quot;My phone went off extremely early in the morning and I spent most of the day on the phone at Swanwick talking to the Department for Transport and the airlines.&quot; The disruption came ahead of the biggest event of the year for Britain&apos;s aviation industry: last week&apos;s publication of the Davies commission&apos;s interim proposals for expanding UK airport capacity. Deakin says the two subjects are linked because Britain&apos;s airspace operates at maximum capacity. That means any disruption has knock-on effects throughout the day because there is no slack in the system to reschedule flights, unlike at Paris&apos;s Charles De Gaulle airport and Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, which run at about 70% of their full capacity. &quot;We need to plan for capacity, resilience and growth. We need to add resilient capacity instead of continuing to run at 100%,&quot; Deakin says. In his interim report, Sir Howard Davies proposed three firm options for increasing airport space in the South East: adding a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing Heathrow runway, and a new runway at Gatwick. He said he would consider mayor of London Boris Johnson&apos;s proposal for a giant new airport in north Kent, although a green-light is deemed to be very unlikely. Deakin&apos;s concerns over Boris island have contributed to the burying of Johnson&apos;s project. Although Nats is not at the forefront of the capacity debate, its advice is vital because those extra flights need to be placed somewhere over England&apos;s crowded skies. Deakin has argued before that the so-called Boris Island airport is the worst option because it will create airborne snarl-ups with planes bound for Schiphol and other London airports. Nonetheless, Deakin says anything is possible technically. &quot;We can add a hub or extra capacity anywhere.&quot; He has also laid down the gauntlet to airlines and Nats&apos; regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, over this month&apos;s disruption. If airlines want to prevent one-off system glitches they will have to help fund the cost of installing extra safeguards and the CAA will need to make a judgment on how much is enough, he says. &quot;Our back-up system delivered 90% capacity so the longer-term question is if 90% wasn&apos;t enough, what is and how will that be funded?&quot; Nats was established in 1962 as National Air Traffic Control Services to control Britain&apos;s civil flights and has been one of the state&apos;s more successful privatisations, barring the odd system failure like this month&apos;s stumble. The government partly privatised the company in 2000, selling 46% to a group of airlines, giving staff a 5% stake and keeping 49%. Heathrow now owns a 4% piece of the airlines&apos; original stake. Nats handles 2.1m flights and 220 million passengers in UK airspace each year. Last year, the average delay per flight was 1.4 seconds \u2013 4% of the European average and down from 130 seconds 10 years ago. Nats will have a new shareholder when the Universities Superannuation Scheme&apos;s purchase of half of the Airline Group shareholding completes early next year. The deal will give the pension fund a 21% indirect stake in Nats and Deakin says it is keen for the company to grow. Last year the company made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3190.7m and international operations make up a growing share of Nats&apos; activities. In 2000, Nats&apos; only operation outside the UK was in Gibraltar but now it sells air traffic control, technology and advice in more than 30 countries. The Middle East and Asia are top of Deakin&apos;s list target markets. His latest deal is working with Rolls-Royce and Qatar Airways to increase the airline&apos;s efficiency when flying Airbuses in and out of Doha airport, saving fuel and money. &quot;It&apos;s something we proposed to Qatar Airways. The worst contract you can do is where you compete against the world. One of the key challenges is putting bodies on the ground. We&apos;re increasingly putting offices into the Middle East, India, Singapore, Hong Kong and other markets to build relationships. We try to avoid just responding to requests for information,&quot; he says. &quot;Asia-Pacific is a huge growth area. It feels as though things haven&apos;t slowed down there even during the recession. Every month in China, 240 new civil aircraft are registered. Can you believe that?&quot; The new year should bring big opportunities for Deakin. But for now there is the small matter of getting a few million people off the tarmac and to their destinations without further technical failure.", "sentences": ["That means any disruption has knock-on effects throughout the day because there is no slack in the system to reschedule flights, unlike at Paris&apos;s Charles De Gaulle airport and Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, which run at about 70% of their full capacity."], "title": "Nats boss's Christmas wish: no further computer problems to disrupt air travel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/23/nats-air-traffic-control-computer-christmas-disruption", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Air transport", "UK news", "Travel & leisure", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-24T08:01:00Z", "article": "   A great read for a great cause. Photograph: image courtesy of The Big Issue    24. The Big Issue There&apos;s surely no social enterprise in Britain that&apos;s more visible than the Big Issue. The idea of the now-famous magazine came from Gordon Roddick (Body Shop) and John Bird in 1991, as a way to help the increasing numbers of people sleeping rough on the streets of London. Since those early days the concept has spread worldwide and there are similar magazines everywhere from Seoul to S\u00e3o Paulo, linked together in the International Network of Street Papers. It is, the Big Issue claims, a global self-help revolution for the homeless. Big Issue vendors are either homeless, in temporary accommodation or at risk of becoming homeless. New vendors are given training and support and are allocated a pitch; half the money they make is passed back to the magazine, half they get to keep. The Big Issue Foundation, the charity behind the magazine, is part of a family of ventures which includes the social investment fund Big Issue Invest. A separate family of social enterprises, the Big Life group (based in Manchester and operating in the north of England), is responsible for The Big Issue in the North.     Toast Christmas in style this year with these excellent co-operative wines. Photograph: image courtesy of The Wine Society    23. The Wine Society  The Wine Society can claim deep historical roots. It was in 1874 that the International Exhibition Co-operative Wine Society (still its official legal name) was established, a members&apos; cooperative designed to supply good quality wines at fair prices. The cooperative, now based in Stevenage, has been meeting this basic function ever since. The Wine Society stresses the benefits of its mutual structure: &quot;It is owned solely by its members, sells only to them and exists purely for their benefit. Member satisfaction is paramount; maximising profit is not,&quot; it says. This means wine prices are normally lower than they would be from conventional businesses. Profits are reinvested and although members do also receive profit dividends these are accumulated and are paid out only on the death of the member. The one-off (refundable) membership share costs \u00a340, and the Society points out that there is no requirement necessarily to buy regularly. As a cooperative, the majority of the Wine Society&apos;s Board of Directors are elected by the membership. Members are also able to attend a range of events such as wine-tastings.

Cre8 Products Cre8 Products officially opened its doors for business in the summer of 2012. Based in Newport, Gwent, this social enterprise produces high quality personalised glassware and slate products. Cre8 Products is the first such venture set up by Solas-Cymru, a housing and support organisation which in turn in part of the Seren Group. Seren supports vulnerable young people, adults and families. &quot;Many of the people we support were struggling to gain access to employment or to find training and volunteering placements that were supportive. We decided one way in which we could tackle this problem was to start our very own social enterprise,&quot; the organisation says. The idea behind the etched glass products now on sale at Cre8 came from Solas&apos;s volunteers, including people living in supported housing schemes, under the guidance of a professional arts worker.

The Bakery Dunbar The Bakery in the East Lothian town of Dunbar aims to produce high-quality breads and patisseries using the best ingredients and traditional recipes. But it is doing much more than that. As a community-owned cooperative with more than six hundred shareholders, it is demonstrating that, when the will is there, local people can come together to save important local services. The story began in 2008 when a long-standing family bakery announced it would be closing. With help from the local community development trust, work was begun on a business plan to create a new, cooperative, bakery. A management committee of local businesspeople, financial experts and marketing specialists came together and in 2009 the first community share issue was launched. Following extensive building work, the new bakery business began trading in October 2011. During 2013 the venture diversified into hosting bread and patisserie courses, whilst its head baker Ross Baxter picked up an award for UK Cake of the Year. The cooperative is committed to working with growers and millers to provide fine flours and where possible to using rarer, heritage-type grains.

LandWorks  The Dartington Hall Trust, a charitable organisation based in an historic hall and 880 acre estate near Totnes in south Devon, has been a place of innovation and creativity ever since the estate was bought in 1925 by two visionaries of their day Dorothy and Leonard Elmhirst. Today, Dartington focuses its activities in three areas, those of the arts, sustainability and social justice. LandWorks is one of its most recent initiatives. It is a work-based training scheme, working with prisoners and ex-prisoners to help them acquire the social and employability skills they need to achieve success in stopping offending. LandWorks forcuses on landscaping and other ground-work activities, using the Dartington estate itself. A new LandWorks garden at Dartington will be a long-term legacy of the work undertaken by the trainees. LandWorks was launched in July and is currently operating with a group of trainees mainly on day release from HMP Channings Wood. Next year the project plans to expand to include a more permanent training centre. &quot;It is incredibly difficult for ex-prisoners to secure and sustain employment upon release,&quot; the Trust says. &quot;LandWorks aims to change this&quot;.     Have a evening stay in Dartington's grand medieval hall. Photograph: image courtesy of Dartington    19. Dartington Hall We&apos;re not a hotel, says Dartington firmly. Admittedly, Dartington Hall happily provides many of the things you&apos;d expect in a country house hotel. There are fifty bedrooms overlooking a mediaeval courtyard available for B&amp;B, a restaurant and bar, beautiful gardens to explore and, beyond them, an 880 acre estate and the rolling Devon countryside. It&apos;s a good place to relax and the hospitality earns plaudits on Trip Advisor\u2026 but that&apos;s not the real point. Dartington describes itself as a &apos;place of learning and experiment&apos;. For almost ninety years, ever since its founders Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst purchased a run-down estate with the aim of launching an experiment in progressive education and in rural regeneration, Dartington has been known as a place of social initiatives and creative happenings. The roll-call of famous visitors ranges from Stravinsky to Simon Rattle, Bertrand Russell to Aldous Huxley. The idea of the Arts Council was concocted at Dartington, too. Today, Dartington still focuses on the arts and also has initiatives in the fields of social justice and sustainability.

Jamie Oliver&apos;s Fifteen The story of how Jamie Oliver launched Fifteen in 2002 is well-known, not least because of the TV series which accompanied its first year of life. Oliver wanted, he says, to create a new restaurant which would serve very high quality food but also to help fifteen apprentices encountering difficulties in their loves. &quot;My intention was to give young people who&apos;ve often faced enormous challenges in their lives the opportunity to unlock their true talent through great training and mentoring,&quot; he says. Profits from Fifteen go to a charity, the Jamie Oliver Food Foundation. From the original London initiative two similar Fifteen restaurants have developed in Amsterdam and London, each with their own charitable trusts. Between the three over 350 young people have graduated, four-fifths of who remain in the catering industry. Apprenticeships at Fifteen are based on on-the-job learning (65%) college work and personal development. Apprentices increasingly work directly in the restaurant, taking it over completely for a week at the end of their year.     Pick out your chocolate essentials with this festive gift set.

Divine Chocolate Divine Chocolate Ltd offers fair trade chocolate from cocoa grown in Ghana by farmer members of the cooperative Kuapa Kokoo (the name means &apos;good cocoa growers&apos;). Kuapa Kokoo is a federation of approximately 1400 village cooperative societies, who between them have about 65,000 members. Local farmers have been joining in increasing numbers, partly because they feel they can trust Kuapa Kokoo as an accountable democratic venture to use accurate weighing scales when buying their crops. There&apos;s an extra twist to the story, however. Unlike conventional fair trade ventures, Kuapa Kokoo itself has a significant shareholding stake in Divine, enabling it to have two places on the Board and the opportunity to influence directly how the brand is developed. This &apos;seat at the table&apos; helps give Kuapa Kpkoo more status in the cocoa industry. Divine chocolate was launched in Britain in 1998 and since 2007 has also been available in the US.     Candy Cane Christmas Pants Photograph: James Newell    16. Who made your pants? This cooperative produces &quot;gorgeous undies&quot; (their words) for women, produced by the coop&apos;s women workers at its small Southampton factory. The venture, launched in 2009, was begun by a local human rights campaigner Becky John who had previously been involved in an Open University film about sweatshops in developing countries. As the coop&apos;s website explains, &quot;This got Becky thinking. &apos;I love lingerie&apos;, she thought, &apos;but where does it come from? Who made my pants?&apos; At that moment the name was born.&quot; Knowing that there was a huge refugee population in Southampton, Becky looked to see if women refugees would be interested in participating in the venture. The women employed by the cooperative are primarily from Afghanistan, Somalia and Sudan, and the cooperative provides training and support when needed for them. &quot;For many of the women we work with, it&apos;s important that this space is for women only. We do everything we can to create a warm, friendly environment,&quot; the coop says. After their success in developing a range of lingerie for women, Who made your pants? is now about to start for the first time producing pants for men as well.

Start in Salford Start in Salford began twenty years ago, when its founder and current CEO Bernadette Conlon began offering art workshops to local Salford people with poor mental health\u2026 using the boot of her car as a base. The charity she set up has come a long way since then and now has a well-resourced centre in Salford with art and media studios, craft workshops and gardens. But Start in Salford&apos;s aims, to encourage both creativity and well-being and to challenge the stigma of mental illness, remain unchanged. &quot;Many vulnerable people in our community are too often left on the sidelines. Start in Salford exists to nurture those talents, and to bring about a new-found confidence in those who feel isolated or excluded,&quot; the organisation says. As well as running such things as life drawing classes, craft sessions and a community choir, Start in Salford also offers professional support, including employment skills, access to formal accredited learning and help for the self-employed.     Need to wake up a sleepy-head on Christmas morning? Why not try the Co-op's truly irresistible Fairtrade coffee. Photograph: Co-op Group     14. The Co-operative Group The Co-op can be proud of its role in bringing fair trade products into mainstream retailing. Back in 1992, it was the first major supermarket chain to stock Caf\u00e9direct coffee, when Caf\u00e9direct was just beginning to create a market in Britain for equitably traded third world food products. Ten years later, the Co-op took arguably an even more important decision, when it switched its entirely own-brand range of coffee to fair trade. The decision meant a guaranteed outlet for many coffee-producing coops at a time when very low commodity prices for coffee threatened farmers&apos; livelihoods. Own-brand chocolate and tea were also switched to fair trade. In this context, &apos;the Co-op&apos; means both Britain&apos;s largest cooperative society, The Co-operative Group, but also the remaining regional independent societies, such as Midlands, Midcounties, Lincolnshire and ScotMid. Although they are separate businesses with their own members and their own elected boards of directors the cooperative societies organise their purchasing jointly, through a consortium called the Co-operative Retail Trading Group (CRTG). Even some of the very small community-based coop societies (such as Coniston in the Lake District and Radstock in Somerset) are signed-up members of the CRTG.     Adopt a baby lobster this Christmas. Photograph: Katie Sindle    13. National Lobster Hatchery Lobster fishing \u2013 and of course, the subsequent cooking and eating of the lobsters caught \u2013 has been a traditional feature of many small coastal communities in Britain. But, as with other aspects of the fishery industry, lobsters are vulnerable to over-exploitation. In both Scandinavia and the Mediterranean, for example, lobster stocks have already collapsed. The National Lobster Hatchery, based in Padstow in north Cornwall, aims to ensure that Britain&apos;s lobsters do not suffer the same fate. A marine conservation, research and education charity, it runs a lobster hatchery in the river Camel estuary which is also a visitor attraction, last year attracting more than 40,000 people. &quot;As well as seeing first hand the fascinating progression of a lobster from egg to adult and learning about our own conservation and research work, children can learn about the wider marine environment and why we should protect it,&quot; the charity says. The National Lobster Hatchery also runs a &apos;Buy one, set one free&apos; initiative with participating restaurants and fishmongers, whereby people ordering lobsters can make a voluntary \u00a31.75 donation to the charity&apos;s work, which is then matched by the business. It also operates a fundraising website, selling everything from chocolate lobsters to stuffed lobster toys.

Better: a feel good place Since its origins in 1993 as a new way of running the former leisure centres of the London Borough of Greenwich, GLL has grown into one of the country&apos;s most enterprising and innovative social enterprises. It now runs over 100 leisure centres in partnership with local authorities in London, the Home Counties and as far away as York, and employs almost 6,000 staff. It has recently extended its remit to include library provision and also operates in the field of health, education and community sport development. GLL is constituted as a charitable &apos;bencom&apos; (society for the benefit of the community). &quot;We believe social values are just as important as financial performance. We don&apos;t have shareholders like private companies, or any bonuses to pay out. Instead we invest any surplus money we make back into our services,&quot; GLL says.  GLL is committed to improving both the customer service it delivers and the way that its employees relate to the business. Staff are encouraged to hold (non-dividend paying) shares in the society, and the majority of GLL&apos;s Board is elected by the workforce.

ARTHOUSE Meath ARTHOUSE Meath is a Surrey-based social enterprise operated by the Meath Epilepsy Trust. Works produced by the ARTHOUSE artists, the majority of whom experience severe ellipse, are widely available through retail outlets and at exhibitions. The organisation also runs its own shop in the centre of Godalming. &quot;The organisation&apos;s main aim is to show what can be and is achieved. Offering purpose to individuals is life changing, especially for those who have been told they can&apos;t, or have been made to feel redundant in the past,&quot; the trust says.  The artists operate in a caring, sheltered environment, where they can develop not only their artistic skills (under the guidance of professional artists) but also social skills such as team participation and work experience. Art sessions are held daily on Mondays to Fridays, and have the added advantage of helping to reduce epileptic seizures (seizures can be reduced when the brain is occupied and interested). ARTHOUSE Meath is, among other things, the trade stationery supplier for Mary Portas concessions in House of Fraser stores. The project also runs an extensive online shop.

Brigade Bar and Bistro There&apos;s a lot of social history behind the former fire station in Tooley Street, on the south bank of the Thames in London.\u00a0 Tooley Street was the scene of a devastating fire in 1861 which lasted two weeks and\u00a0which led directly to the formation of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade.\u00a0The fire engines have since been moved elsewhere but the Tooley Street Fire Station is continuing to make history, now as a fashionable bistro and bar. Brigade is more than just a restaurant however, with - in the words of its chef-founder Simon Boyle - an appetite for distinctive food and individual service.\u00a0 It&apos;s also a social enterprise which, through the linked Beyond Food Foundation, offers people who have experienced homelessness or have been at risk the opportunity to take part in an apprenticeship programme.\u00a0 Apprentices obtain the qualifications, and receive the personal mentoring, to ensure that they can go on to find sustainable employment in the future.

Pants to Poverty Pants to Poverty makes a bold claim. It maintains that, by producing good quality underwear, loungewear and pyjamas, it helps prove that fashion really can change the world. The inspiration behind Pants to Poverty came from a speech Nelson Mandela made in Britain in 2005 when he called for a generation to support the call to &apos;make poverty history&apos;. Pants to Poverty sees itself as part of that campaign. Its staple products are colourful jersey underpants for both men and women which are produced for it by Chetna Organic, a federation of farmers&apos; cooperatives across a thousand villages in three states of India. &quot;In these communities the farmers have been working intimately with the land, flora and fauna for many generations supporting the delicate balance of life and death that produces their food and cash crops. Everything they use is locally produced, sustainable and generates social, environmental and financial profit for them and their communities. This is where our pants start their life,&quot; says the enterprise.     Anyone fancy a new bike? Photograph: Miles Dell    8. Bikeworks London-based Bikeworks, winner of the best new social enterprise award in 2009, is a Community Interest Company which aims to encourage many more people to get on their bikes and start turning those pedals and spinning those wheels. The company&apos;s story begins back in 2006, and has grown from the shared vision of three founders, Jim Blakemore, Zoe Portlock and Dave Miller. Bikeworks encourages bicycle reuse and recycling, works in schools to help children learn to ride safely and also operates bike stores offering a full range of repair services and the sale of new and refurbished bikes.  Bikeworks also works with businesses to encourage them to make their workplaces cycle-friendly, among other things by offering bicycle repair whilst employees are at work. Our mission, Bikeworks says, is to actively change lives by offering positive cycling experiences. Its community cycling programme has included work opportunities for disadvantaged groups.

Heart and Home Based in the Quays Shopping Centre in Newry, Northern Ireland, Heart and Home is a gift shop with a difference. It marks the first step in an initiative from Clanrye Retail Social Enterprise (CRSE) to operate a business that trains people with physical disabilities in retail related work, giving them both accredited qualifications and real hand-on experience. The shop opened in January 2012, and since then Heart and Home has developed further by opening an e-commerce site online.  CRSE is part of the larger Clanrye Group, a pioneering venture which was first established in 1982 to address spiralling levels of unemployment in the Newry area. What began offering skills training in areas such as joinery and hairdressing has expanded fast. Today Clanrye focuses particularly on helping young people with learning difficulties or disabilities, adults with a physical disability, and unemployed young people with low skills levels. Its mission is &quot;to train, motivate and develop people for a brighter future in line with industry and commerce&quot;.      Looking for present ideas for your little one?

From Babies with Love From Babies with Love is a social enterprise selling baby clothes online which gives all of its profits to the international children&apos;s charity SOS Villages. It was begun by Cecilia Crossley as a direct result of the birth of her son and of the concern she felt in reading about the hardships faced by babies elsewhere in the world. &quot;I was out shopping for my son&apos;s baby clothes and I thought, If I could buy a babygrow and know that the profit is going to help less fortunate babies around the world, why would I buy anything else?,&quot; she says. &quot;There was no-one else who was doing this, so I decided to do it myself.&quot; She decided to support SOS Villages, a charity originally begun in Austria after the Second World War which now runs over 500 dedicated villages for orphaned and abandoned children across the world. From Babies with Love has a particularly close link with the Chipata village in Zambia and with Lilongwe in Malawi, both of which benefit from the enterprise&apos;s profits.

Global SeeSaw  Freeset Ltd, and the online shop Global SeeSaw linked to it, is a British social enterprise directly helping women in India leave the sex trade and receive both employment and educational opportunities. Global SeeSaw imports and sells natural jute bags, organic fairtrade cotton t-shirts and a range of other gift items produced in India by women who had previously been trafficked into prostitution. &quot;We&apos;re into ethical trade not because it&apos;s the latest thing but because it&apos;s the right thing,&quot; the organisation says. &quot;We believe that business can make a real difference.&quot; Profits are reinvested back to enable Freeset to extend the range of its business. Freeset&apos;s cofounder Kerry Hilton talks of the satisfaction of being engaged in a social enterprise which directly helps women regain their freedom. &quot;The women are broadly involved in the life of the business and participate actively in decision-making, such as the hiring of staff,&quot; he says. He emphasises that Freeset is not a charity, but adds that &quot;when you buy a Freeset bags or a Freeset t-shirt, your money is directly contributing to women&apos;s freedom&quot;.

Rubies in the Rubble Rubies in the Rubble is the result of the vision of Jenny Dawson who left her job in 2010 to launch a social enterprise doing &quot;something I really care about&quot;. As she explains, the chutneys and jams produced by the business in its purpose-built kitchen at New Spitalfields market in London are made with the unsold fruit and vegetables which would otherwise be dumped. Britain wastes sixteen million tonnes of food a year, she says. &quot;To you it might just be a jar of chutney but to me it&apos;s a solution,&quot; she says. She adds that Rubies in the Rubble not only turns potentially wasted food into high-quality products (now sold at London&apos;s fashionable Borough Market and in high-end delis) but also provides a way back for unemployed people looking to get back into work. &quot;These products are powerful examples of the innate beauty in so much that our society discards and a way of empowering people in some of the most impoverished areas of our city,&quot; Jenny adds.

Chocolate Memories Chocolate Memories is a social enterprise established three years ago by the charity Autism Initiatives. It is based in Moneyreagh in County Down (Northern Ireland), and offers training to adults with Autism Spectrum Condition. The social enterprise makes a range of Belgian-style chocolates using very high-quality ingredients, and is currently gearing up for Christmas with a range of special products including a luxury Christmas hamper at \u00a325. Profits are reinvested back into the business, to enable it to meet its social objectives. &quot;Combining training opportunities for young adults with autism whilst creating a high quality chocolate range has always been a rewarding challenge for the team involved. Our trainees are always at the heart of everything we do and they are introduced to all areas of the business,&quot; Chocolate Memories says. All its products are given a &apos;Carefully Made By&apos; sticker, giving the name of the trainee responsible.  David is one of the trainees featured in this way. &quot;I have really grown in confidence and I have got good skills working here,&quot; he says.     Why not pop out for a brew this Christmas?

Based in Herefordshire on the border with Worcestershire, it provides supported work and training opportunities for local people with disabilities or for those who are otherwise socially excluded. Brew On produces a range of craft brewed ales and cider under the &apos;Trusted&apos; brand, available locally in a number of outlets including National Trust properties. Brew On says that, by providing opportunities for real work and training, it aims to improve the lives of local people who would otherwise have very restricted employment choices. &quot;Often people with disabilities or who are socially excluded are unable to find these opportunities in rural areas, and feel that they must relocate to more urban areas,&quot; the company says. Brew On is helping to maintain the cultural and social diversity of communities in the Herefordshire and Worcestershire countryside, it adds.     Father Christmas is visiting The Eden Project this year. Photograph: Steve Tanner    1. The Eden Project The Eden Project near St Austell in Cornwall has enjoyed astonishing success since it opened its doors to the public in 2000. What began as a dream \u2013 the idea of turning a sterile wasteland where china clay had once been dug into an inspiring centre celebrating environmental and social regeneration \u2013 has attracted more than 13m people and, according to its co-founder Sir Tim Smit, has contributed over \u00a31bn into the Cornish economy. The Eden Project is a year-round tourist attraction run by Eden Project Ltd, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the educational charity the Eden Trust. The Project is keen to point out that it operates as a social enterprise. Although the physical infrastructure of the site including the domes was paid for by grant money, primarily lottery and European funds, its maintenance and all the running costs are covered by earned income. &quot;Because we&apos;re a social enterprise, we reinvest our profits into the charity&apos;s educational projects,&quot; the Eden Project says. &quot;Just like conventional companies, social enterprises compete to deliver goods and services, but social and environmental purposes are at the heart of what they do.&quot; For more news, opinions and ideas about the social enterprise sector, join our community", "sentences": ["From the original London initiative two similar Fifteen restaurants have developed in Amsterdam and London, each with their own charitable trusts."], "title": "Meet the social enterprises behind our Christmas gift advent calendar", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/dec/01/social-enterprise-christmas-gift-advent-calendar-present-ideas", "tags": ["Social enterprise"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-24T13:50:24Z", "article": "Maybe Tolstoy was right, and that all unhappy families are unhappy in their own way. But this was a show that made you wonder. Placing a single relationship under the microscope and investigating it from every available angle, director Ivo van Hove and a team of actors from his Toneelgroep Amsterdam, returning to London&apos;s Barbican after triumphant versions of Shakespeare and Antonioni, reminded us of a sharp and and needling truth \u2013 that our own tragedies, so all-occupying to us, so distinctive and profound, aren&apos;t even that original. Bergman&apos;s version \u2013 made in 1973 for Swedish television \u2013 is a claustrophobic chamber piece, tracking the breakdown of a relationship between Johan, an academic, and Marianne, a lawyer, from the point where they&apos;re celebrating their 10th anniversary to the months after their divorce. The style is hyper-naturalistic, unflatteringly intimate: the actors, chattering bourgeois inanities over each other at dinner parties and in bed, are imprisoned in tight domestic spaces, the camera scrutinising them in closeup. Entire histories are conveyed in a hurried glance, or the way a cigarette is slipped from a packet. It&apos;s like watching a Vermeer come to life \u2013 except that everyone on this canvas is screwing everyone else, or about to have a breakdown. Van Hove&apos;s insight was to retain the piece&apos;s intimacy while exploding its potential. Instead of one Johan and Marianne, we had three pairs, each playing out a different part of the story \u2013 the moment where Johan (played by Hugo Koolschijn as man in the throes of a belated midlife crisis) blithely admits he has a lover and announces his intention to leave; an agonised phonecall with Marianne&apos;s mother, where she fails\u00a0yet again to escape the dreaded Sunday dinner (here offered as a playful, semi-serious game by the much younger Roeland Fernhout and Hadewych Minis). As an audience, we commuted between sections of a huge improvised structure, with the actors&apos; communal dressing room at its centre, provocatively on display throughout. As each scene unspooled, each Johan and Marianne grappling with their own set of dissimilar yet identical problems, you could hear muffled squabbling from all the other couples at once. The effect was like eavesdropping on your neighbours. It was also, you began to realise, like eavesdropping on yourself. In the second half, as the story neared its climax, the structure was cleared, and the final scenes played out under arc lights on the vast amphitheatre of the Barbican stage, with each Johan and Marianne shadowing each other \u2013 sometimes chanting the text in unison, sometimes splintering polyphonically into pairs or groups. Scores were settled and revenges issued; home truths dispensed, compromises reluctantly brokered. At times, as these couples dragged each other along the floor or burst through the watching audience, it looked like the opening stages of a riot. But when resolution was eventually reached \u2013 Johan and Marianne&apos;s realisation that they can&apos;t, in the end, live without each other \u2013 it had the feeling of absolution, something fragile plucked from the very brink. Perhaps it sounds punishing \u2013 at four hours, it wasn&apos;t for the faint of heart \u2013 but what made Scenes brilliant theatre, I think, was its freedom. Van Hove and his ensemble must have choreographed every last moment, but it nonetheless felt like an extended improvisation, created with the barest of theatrical means (a table, some chairs, a bed) and finished with dextrous lightness of touch. Tension built and dissolved, the pace beat faster then slowed. Always we were reminded that this was fiction; yet the performances were so meticulously observed that life itself seemed to be happening in front of us, just a few feet away. Continental European theatre is sometimes accused of being auteur-ish, clever-clever, dismissive of its audience. Toneelgroep&apos;s Scenes stood as a rebuke to that: a reminder of how intimacy can be crafted within the epic, and how a bold directorial vision can liberate rather than dominate a piece. It made much British drama, wedded to a certain kind of realism, look Pooterish and provincial. It also reminded us of something only falteringly realised by Bergman&apos;s long-suffering couple: how exhilarating it is to break free.", "sentences": ["Placing a single relationship under the microscope and investigating it from every available angle, director Ivo van Hove and a team of actors from his Toneelgroep Amsterdam, returning to London&apos;s Barbican after triumphant versions of Shakespeare and Antonioni, reminded us of a sharp and and needling truth \u2013 that our own tragedies, so all-occupying to us, so distinctive and profound, aren&apos;t even that original."], "title": "Best theatre of 2013, No 6: Scenes from a Marriage", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/dec/24/best-theatre-of-2013-no-6-scenes-from-a-marriage", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-24T16:00:00Z", "article": "Prostitution is legal in Canada, but governed by provisions within the criminal code. On Friday, the Canadian supreme court struck down three of these provisions as unconstitutional, deeming them incompatible with the rights of sex workers. The court ruled that three key pieces of legislation \u2013 against keeping a bawdy house; living off the avails of prostitution; and soliciting on public streets \u2013 endanger the nation&apos;s sex workers. Should it rise to the challenge, Stephen Harper&apos;s conservative government has just one year to draw up a new legal framework for Canada&apos;s sex industry. The women who brought the case to court \u2013 Terri-Jean Bedford, Amy Lebovitch and Valerie Scott \u2013 are delighted by the ruling, which they see as a step towards ensuring the dignity and safety of Canada&apos;s sex workers. I very much hope they&apos;re right: that any new legislation will be in keeping with the liberal spirit of Friday&apos;s judgment, and that a failure to legislate will not expose Canada&apos;s sex workers to exploitation. But I have qualms. It&apos;s highly unlikely that Harper will push for criminalising prostitution, as per, for example, the United States. This move would be contrary to the rights-based thrust of the ruling, and we&apos;d soon end up back in court. But, realistically, with Harper at the helm, how permissive is Canada&apos;s new prostitution legislation likely to be? Just last month a conservative party convention in Calgary resolved to &quot;develop a Canada-specific plan to target the purchasers of sex and human trafficking markets through criminalising the purchase of sex as well as any third party attempting to profit from the purchase of sex&quot;. This is basically the Nordic model, pioneered in Sweden, in which people paying for sex rather than prostitutes are criminalised. And I, for one, think it&apos;s ludicrous. The model has cut down on trafficking and street prostitution, sure, but a 2004 report suggests that it is making things more dangerous for prostitutes, who are now experiencing increased violence, lower payments and pressure to have unprotected sex at the hands of customers who are not afraid to engage in criminal activity. Here&apos;s the kernel of the problem: legislation seemingly focused on sex workers often has negative repercussions for the people it aims to protect. Canada&apos;s provision regards living off the avails of prostitution, for example, was originally intended to protect against parasitic pimps; in reality, it stopped women from hiring legitimate drivers and bodyguards, and put them at greater risk. But the kind of loosely regulated system that would result from a failure of the Harper government to legislate is no better option. In 2005, just five years after the Netherlands legalised prostitution with the goal of protecting sex workers, reports made plain that Amsterdam&apos;s ballooning red light district was a hotbed of criminal activity, coercion and violence. The Netherlands remains a major global destination for human trafficking. Germany&apos;s decriminalisation in 2002 also led to an increase in prostitution, and Germany too is now a focal point for human trafficking. Into all this doom and gloom I will insert the tale of New Zealand, where, since 2003, prostitution has been legal, but coercion is illegal, as is immigration to perform sex work and investment in the sex industry. In dialogue with prostitutes, the government developed a health and safety structure for the industry, meaning that anyone selling sex has a legal responsibility to use a sheath. In 2005, someone was even charged for slipping the condom off without a prostitute&apos;s knowledge. A report commissioned five years after the legislation showed that the sex industry still had many problems \u2013 stigma and violence among them \u2013 but there was no increase in prostitution, and sex workers were more empowered. Canada has the chance to do something groundbreaking here \u2013 to learn from experiments with liberalisation and legislation around the world, and to develop a new framework to protect and empower prostitutes while disenfranchising their would-be exploiters. But it may be too much to hope that Harper listens to voices from within the sex industry and, in the spirit of this supreme court ruling, helps to lift vulnerable sex workers out of the shadows.", "sentences": ["In 2005, just five years after the Netherlands legalised prostitution with the goal of protecting sex workers, reports made plain that Amsterdam&apos;s ballooning red light district was a hotbed of criminal activity, coercion and violence."], "title": "Legal changes could put Canada's sex workers at further risk | Emer O'Toole", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/24/legal-changes-canada-sex-workers-risk", "tags": ["Canada", "Prostitution", "Society", "Americas", "World news", "Stephen Harper"]}, {"publicationDate": "2013-12-25T09:21:00Z", "article": "&apos;Twas the night before Christmas, all over the house, not a creature was stirring \u2013 except for Justin Bieber, who chose Christmas Eve to announce his &quot;official&quot; retirement on Twitter.
