It will also, hopefully, spill previously unspilled beans on her relationships with Billy Corgan and Steve Coogan. Oh, and according to an interview she did with Rolling Stone, it was inspired by Russell Brand&apos;s My Booky Wook. The mind boggles. TJ Everything to do with Kanye WestKanye has hinted that a seventh studio album of his should see the light in 2014. But even without the prospect of this &quot;minimalist eight-track&quot; affair, be sure that Kanye&apos;s quotes, wild displays and jaw-dropping motorbike-humping videos will make him the most talked about pop star of the year.

TJ Film 12 Years a SlaveSteve McQueen&apos;s Oscar-bound drama about Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man kidnapped and sold into slavery in pre-civil war America, is remarkable, if not for its classy performances (Michael Fassbender&apos;s volatile plantation owner\u00a0is chillingly good), then for the\u00a0fact that it&apos;s based on a true story. McQueen uses Solomon&apos;s personal anguish to cut to the heart of a superpower&apos;s relationship with the slave trade. Henry Barnes 10 January. The Wolf of Wall StreetMartin Scorsese&apos;s bleak Wall Street comedy arrives after the reckoning, but is set before the crash. Based loosely on the book by former trader Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an amoral money man snorting his way through multiple millions as the stock climbs higher and\u00a0the party gets louder. There&apos;s no nod to the recession, no attempt to find meaning in excess. Just more money, more drugs, more fun. Morality is for wimps. HB 17 January. NymphomaniacSex.

Lars von Trier \u2013 him of the genital mutilation (Antichrist) and the extended disability joke (The Idiots) \u2013 knows how to push our buttons. Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stacy Martin share panting duties as Jo, a sex addict detailing her conquests to an older male confidante. Von Trier premiered the film, which contains scenes of penetrative sex, bondage and fellatio, on Christmas Day. Happy holidays! HB 21 February.  TranscendenceChristopher Nolan proved that brainiac sci-fi could do well at the box office with Inception. Now his cinematographer, Wally Pfister, puts his mind to directing with a similarly cerebral thriller. Johnny Depp plays an artificial intelligence researcher who is willing to sacrifice himself to create a sentient machine.

Ben Affleck plays a\u00a0struggling journalist implicated in the\u00a0disappearance of his wife (Rosamund Pike), who went missing on the day of their fifth anniversary. Set in the heart of recession-hit small town America, Gone Girl is a gritty suspense story. It&apos;ll need someone experienced in delivering grim-minded thrillers to direct.

The film version of Veronica Mars, a cult US TV show in which Kristen Bell&apos;s high-school super-sleuth solves crimes in her downtime, was floundering in development. Then creator Rob Thomas turned to the 90,000 fans on the internet that were ready to chip in and see the film made.

HB  A Million Ways to Die in the WestFamily Guy creator/swing crooner/feminist-baiting Oscar host Seth MacFarlane steps out from behind the camera with this comedy western. MacFarlane plays a yellow-bellied sheep farmer whose lack of courage costs him his gal (Amanda Seyfried). Only a rambunctious adventure across the old west, a duel with an infamous outlaw (Liam Neeson) and many, many dick jokes can help our hero get back on the horse. HB  6 June.

An upcoming three-part\u00a0BBC1 documentary promises &quot;unprecedented access&quot; to the company, from boardroom to the lowly\u00a0restaurant chef. It&apos;ll be worth watching for no other reason than to\u00a0see if the truth of KFC is closer to the\u00a0adverts (tender-eyed men stroking organic chicken wings) or most people&apos;s experiences (cross-eyed hen night revellers staggering up to the counter at 3am, bellowing &quot;BARGAIN BUCKET&quot;).

Photograph: Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images    Sochi Winter Olympics The Winter Olympics never tend to catch the public&apos;s imagination to the extent of its summer counterpart. The 2014 games look set to go the same way, thanks to the outcry and drip-by-drip boycott over Russia&apos;s human rights violations. However, Olympic fever is still strong here, so it might only take one British medallist to get everyone tuning in again. SH BBC The Trial Recent high-profile controversies about the ethics and outcomes of drug trials have meant the use of humans for pharmaceutical testing has become a recurrent subject in popular culture: including Lucy Prebble&apos;s National Theatre play The Effect and an episode of the Channel 4 drama series Fresh Meat.

Architecture Battle of the towers of LondonWith plans for novelty towers shaped like a can of ham, a knife and a rolled-up napkin set to join the Gherkin in the City of London, the table is almost laid for a surreal dinner party in the sky. This year, two of its biggest guests will finally join the party, with the completion of the Cheesegrater, by Richard Rogers, and Rafael Vi\u00f1oly&apos;s Walkie-Scorchie &quot;fryscraper&quot;. With the latter undergoing an expensive retrofit to try\u00a0to banish the lethal &quot;death ray&quot;, will it be safe to walk along Eastcheap this summer? Oliver Wainwright     Shimmering apparition \u2026 Glasgow School of Art.    Glasgow School of Art by Steven HollLooming over Charles Rennie Mackintosh&apos;s original Glasgow School of Art building, American architect Steven Holl&apos;s new extension to the college has\u00a0been designed as a shimmering apparition of greenish glass in contrast to the heavy masonry structure across the road. A spiralling sequence of studios will climb up through the building, arranged around &quot;driven voids&quot; to bring light down deep into the floors below. The different departments will\u00a0all be connected by a continuous zig-zagging route designed, says\u00a0the architect, to encourage &quot;creative abrasion&quot;. OW A House for EssexThe final project of mischievous architecture practice FAT, which recently announced its breakup, this\u00a0surreal hybrid between a Thai wat\u00a0and an Essex barn will be one of\u00a0their strangest projects yet. Conceived as a scaled-up gingerbread house, it will be decked out\u00a0with ceramic mouldings and\u00a0tapestries by Grayson Perry, along with a line of his sculptures on the top of the roof. It will be the latest building in Alain de Botton&apos;s programme of Living Architecture holiday rentals \u2013 and promises to be the kookiest of the lot. OW Classical  Master of the Queen&apos;s MusicPeter Maxwell Davies&apos;s self-imposed 10-year limit on his stint as Master of\u00a0the Queen&apos;s Music ends in March, a\u00a0few months before his 80th birthday. There&apos;s no stand-out candidate to succeed him, for it&apos;s\u00a0hard to imagine most of the other leading British composers of today writing the ceremonial music required. Mark-Anthony Turnage might be one possible candidate, though; others could be\u00a0Judith Weir, Michael Berkeley or\u00a0Jonathan Dove. Before that appointment, though, the LSO has\u00a0a\u00a0major Maxwell Davies premiere,\u00a0when Antonio Pappano conducts what\u00a0Davies says will be his\u00a0last symphony, the Tenth. Andrew\u00a0Clements Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 8891), 1 February. ThebansIn an age when too many composers are encouraged to compose their first\u00a0operas at far too young an age, Julian Anderson has taken his time before embarking on one. Thebans, with a\u00a0libretto by playwright Frank McGuinness, based upon Sophocles&apos; Oedipus and Antigone plays, has been\u00a0gestating for some years since ENO first\u00a0offered Anderson a commission. It&apos;s directed by Pierre\u00a0Audi, intendant of the Netherlands Opera and once a familiar figure in London contemporary music, here making\u00a0his ENO debut. AC Coliseum, London WC2 (020-7845 9300), 3 May to 3 June. Art Sensing SpacesArchitecture is not just about walls and doors and iconic skylines. It is about what&apos;s inside a shape \u2013 the volumes that a building contains and how the human body moves through them. From labyrinths to pods, from vast open halls to underground swimming pools, architecture can craft powerful spatial experiences. This\u00a0exhibition uses multimedia installations to make the most avant-garde spaces of 21st-century architecture come alive. Jonathan Jones Royal Academy, London W1 (020-7300 8000), 25 January to 6 April. Art as TherapyAuthor Alain de Botton believes museums should change lives. This exhibition applies that ideal \u2013 the theme of his book Art as Therapy \u2013 to the great collections of the Rijksmuseum. Can Rembrandt&apos;s Nightwatch help you deal with a fear of the dark? Does Vermeer&apos;s Milkmaid suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder? The exhibition no doubt asks far more profound questions than these as it aims to show how artistic masterpieces can heal the pain of\u00a0modern life. JJ Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (0031 20 6747 000), 25\u00a0April\u00a0to 7 September. Digital RevolutionDigital culture is the future that&apos;s already\u00a0here. But is it art? That old chestnut of a question is likely to be raised in new forms by this survey of how the digital revolution is changing everything from music (will.i.am is a participant) to cinema and interactive art (represented by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer among others). Perhaps the most fascinating field for debate is gaming, which is both addictive and genuinely creative in the complex imaginary worlds it reveals. If digital life is art, is the artist an individual or a\u00a0crowd? JJ Barbican, London EC1 (020-7638 8891), 3 July to 14 September. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 January 2014.

Penny Dreadful This has a remarkable lineage: it is produced by film and stage director Sam Mendes and John Logan, who wrote Skyfall for Mendes as well as Hugo, The Aviator and Gladiator.

Captain America: The Winter SoldierMarvel Films just keep churning them out. This is the ninth recent derivation from The Avengers family, a follow-up to 2011&apos;s Captain America: The First Avenger, and a side-project of all those Iron Man and Thor movies. If the title is anything to go by, this one features the Cap&apos;s former sidekick Bucky, revived and transformed into a Soviet-era assassin. The usual Marvel crew are due to put in an appearance, led by Chris Evans and Scarlett Johannson (as\u00a0Black Widow). We&apos;ll also get to see Robert Redford in his first superhero movie, as a senior Shield operative. AP 28 March. The Amazing Spider-Man 2Hands up if you think there&apos;s been too many Spider-Man films? Well, it doesn&apos;t matter: here&apos;s another, courtesy of studio Sony&apos;s desire to keep hold of its rights to the material. Admittedly, the new series of Marc Webb-directed webslingery infuses the Spidey story with a roughhouse, skater-chic charm, with Andrew Garfield one of the classiest performers to ever don Spandex. Not too much has yet emerged of this one&apos;s plot, except that the Rhino (Paul Giamatti) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) appear to be the big villains. AP April. Dawn of the Planet of the ApesTim Burton&apos;s 2001 Planet of the Apes remake encouraged studio 20th Century Fox to punt a hopeful new series of the simian-bothering sci-fi. Now Cloverfield director Matt Reeves is in charge, filling in events well before the classic Charlton Heston story. Gary Oldman is the human talent, facing off against the apes. AP 17 July. Sin City: A Dame to Die ForAlmost a decade after the first instalment, here&apos;s a second collection of Frank Miller&apos;s sicko noir stories, with Miller again sharing directorial duties with Robert Rodriguez. Many of the same characters (and actors) are returning, including Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis; expect another dose of highly stylised comic-panel noir, with stunning visuals doing their best to compensate for the rampantly creepy sexism. AP 29 August. The Hobbit: There and Back AgainCritical opinion has held that things have picked up with Smaug, after the bloat of the first film, An Unexpected Journey, so here&apos;s hoping Peter Jackson can keep the standard up. Presumably There and Back Again will take in the aftermath of the dwarves&apos; takeover of the Lonely Mountain, their confrontation with the Wood-Elves and humans of Lake-town, and the climactic Battle of the Five Armies. After that, we&apos;ll all need a rest. AP 19 December. ExodusRidley Scott is offering up a Cecil B DeMille-ish answer to Darren Aronofsky&apos;s Noah, by retelling the Moses story with Christian Bale as the Jewish law-maker. Joel Edgerton is the Pharaoh Rameses, Sigourney Weaver the Pharaoh&apos;s mum Tuya, and Aaron Paul the Mosaic sidekick Joshua. As the founding myth of biblical Israel, this could be controversial territory, but Scott has successfully handled this type of tricky material before, in the crusades movie Kingdom of Heaven, and we expect him to be as agile here as before. AP 5 December. Theatre Shakespeare in LoveThe film made Joseph Fiennes. And, thanks to a smartly self-aware script by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, wasn&apos;t too bad for Shakespeare either. Screen-to-stage musicals have become almost as predictable as traffic jams in the West End, but thanks to the involvement of adapter Lee Hall (Billy Elliot) and director Declan Donnellan (of Cheek by Jowl), hopes are high that this might not pale beside the Shakespearean glories of West Side Story and Kiss Me Kate. Andrew Dickson Noel Coward theatre, London W1 (0871 976 0072), from 1 July.  Miss SaigonIt&apos;s 25 years since this reworking of Puccini&apos;s Madame Butterfly \u2013 set in Saigon in 1975 as the Americans withdraw from Vietnam \u2013 opened in a production by the then little-known Nicholas Hytner. The Prince Edward is a smaller space for this epic love story from the writing team behind Les Mis\u00e9rables, so it&apos;ll be interesting to see if the reboot (and the famous helicopter scene) come off. Lyn Gardner Prince Edward theatre, London W1 (0844 482 5155), from 3 May.  I Can&apos;t Sing!In one sense, it doesn&apos;t matter if no one can, because apparently Simon Cowell already approves of Harry Hill&apos;s and Steve Brown&apos;s irreverent take on the story behind The X Factor. With the TV programme&apos;s ratings on the slide, this tribute to the show that gives birth to talented and talentless alike arrives at an intriguing moment. LG London Palladium W1 (0844 811 0058), from 27 February.  Fatal AttractionNo announcement on casting yet, but this Trevor Nunn-directed adaptation of the 1987 thriller about a New York lawyer who discovers it wasn&apos;t so smart to end his affair will need big names to bring it (and the bunny) to the boil. LG Theatre Royal Haymarket, London SW1 (020-7930 8800), from 8 March. Art Matisse: The Cut-OutsThere is no more enigmatic masterpiece of modern art than Matisse&apos;s Snail, a huge paper cut-out whose revolving planes of colour have been delighting visitors to the Tate since it was bought by the museum in 1962. A toddler can enjoy this work of art \u2013 and recognise the shape of a snail \u2013 but is it an image or an abstract decoration that happens to be snail-like? This feast of colour and movement that Matisse created in 1953 exceeds any possible pictorial intention. Matisse made his cut-outs when the art world was transfixed by American abstraction. Yet the French painter asks more profound questions about the nature of meaning in art than Jackson Pollock ever did. His Snail is a sly subversive mocking all attempts to interpret it. Promises to be the most popular and beautiful artistic event of the year. Jonathan Jones Tate Modern, London SE1, 17\u00a0April to 7 September. VikingsThe world shuddered. Monks in Lindisfarne lay awake listening for war cries. On the far side of the world, native Americans saw sails on the horizon. The Vikings were a power in the world, a demonic force of pagan mayhem that threatened to destroy the frail beginnings of Europe and even put a frostbitten toe in Newfoundland. Yet a lot of the time, these Scandinavians farmed and told stories. To be a &quot;viking&quot; was a seasonal occupation: it meant to go out on the summer seas looking for trouble. Destructive as these warriors were, their myths are fascinating, their art has a rugged splendour, and this show \u2013 which includes a real longship \u2013 should thunder like Thor&apos;s hammer. JJ British Museum, London WC1, 6 March to 22 June. Mondrian and Colour Two major shows focus on the impeccable Dutch abstractionist Piet Mondrian. Mondrian and Colour at Turner in Margate considers the significance of colour in\u00a0his early career, bringing together around 40 paintings by the artist from the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag and other collections in Europe and the US. Tate Liverpool will present the concurrent show Mondrian and his Studios: Abstraction into the World. This will explore the artist&apos;s importance both as abstractionist and in his relationship with architecture and urbanism, and the spaces and places, in Amsterdam, Paris and New York, where he worked. The show will also include his wonderful 1914 series Pier and Ocean. Do that geometric boogie-woogie thing! Adrian\u00a0Searle Turner Contemporary, Margate, 24 May to 21 September; Tate Liverpool, 6 June to 21 September.  ColourColour in painting is as much the product of chemistry and the availability of pigments as it is of an artist&apos;s perceptions. Colour can be symbolic, it can imitate nature, it can be as earthy, ethereal and fugitive as it can be poisonous and exorbitantly expensive and rare. The history of painting is, in part, a history of materials and their uses. The development of impressionism and plein-aire painting was as much related to new industrially manufactured pigments and their availability in tubes as it was to artistic theory. Trade routes and artistic experiment, technical innovation and an almost alchemical search for the lost secrets of the old masters changed the way paintings looked and were made in radical and far-reaching ways. Each room will be devoted to a different colour, and will look at the National&apos;s own collection in relation to minerals, textiles, ceramics and glass on loan from major national and international cultural institutions. AS National Gallery, London WC2, 18 June to 7 September.     Photograph: The National Gallery    Rembrandt: The Final YearsForty paintings, 20 drawings and 30 prints by an artist doesn&apos;t sound a lot, but when the person we&apos;re talking about is Rembrandt and the focus is on\u00a0the works he created in the last two\u00a0decades of his life, expect something magisterial. Like late\u00a0Titian, Rembrandt&apos;s style towards the end of his life became ever more frank and unconcerned with\u00a0the kind\u00a0of painterly decorum\u00a0and\u00a0detail expected by\u00a0his patrons. With his churned-up surfaces, harsh lighting and dramatic settings, his manner achieved more than an illusion of directness. Nowhere is this clearer than in his drawings and etchings. And when we look at Rembrandt looking at himself, in his late self-portraits, we get the feeling that he just doesn&apos;t care what we think. Which is exactly what makes us care as much as we do.

Architecture Shanghai Tower, by GenslerAs America bickers over which of its towers is tallest, the new World Trade Center or the Sears Tower, China is busy building soaring totems that will outshine them all. Next year will see the completion of the gargantuan Shanghai Tower, the second tallest building in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, at 632 metres. Designed by anonymous corporate giant Gensler, it climbs in a spiral like a frozen whirlwind, captured in glass, housing a stack of offices, shops and vertical gardens, and accommodating up to 16,000 people.

Antonio Pappano: Verdi RequiemFew conductors today bring out the drama of Verdi better than Pappano. His 2009 recording of the Requiem with his Rome-based Orchestra of Santa Cecilia won rave reviews, not only for its moments of blazing theatricality, but also for its finely crafted details and quality of intense inwardness. For these two UK concerts he&apos;s joined by top-notch soloists, including tenor Joseph Calleja, in what promises to be an unbeatable live experience. Imogen Tilden Symphony Hall, Birmingham, 16 May; Royal Festival Hall, London SE1, 18 May. John Eliot Gardiner: MonteverdiFifty years ago a Cambridge undergraduate assembled a group of singers to perform what was then still an extreme rarity, Monteverdi&apos;s great 1611 setting of the Vespers, in King&apos;s College Chapel. Those singers formed the nucleus of what became the Monteverdi Choir and have continued their close association with that concert&apos;s conductor, John Eliot Gardiner, ever since. On the exact anniversary Gardiner and his choir and\u00a0orchestra, the English Baroque Soloists, return to King&apos;s to recreate that debut; even though Monteverdi&apos;s Vespers is much more familiar now than it was in 1964, it is always thrilling to hear it live.

To the son of West Indian parents, slavery&apos;s history is the story of his very existence: &quot;So there is a\u00a0weight on your chest, on your back, from a very early age.&quot; Yet\u00a0he\u00a0cannot recall having ever\u00a0felt\u00a0angry about it. &quot;Angry?&quot; He looks puzzled. &quot;No.\u00a0You feel hurt that someone did such things, but angry? No.&quot; To\u00a0McQueen, the notion sounds as bizarre as finding slavery funny. &quot;Painful, sure. Hurt, absolutely. I don&apos;t know if that can be seen as anger. Not to say that I&apos;m not angry with injustice, of course \u2013 and slavery is a huge injustice. But thinking about it that way? No.&quot; From his baffled expression, you might think him literally unaware that anger is quite a common response. Like many artists, McQueen experiences the world from a highly singular perspective. As a\u00a0working-class boy growing up in 1980s suburbia, &quot;there were no examples of artists who were like me. When did you ever see a\u00a0black man doing what I wanted to do?&quot; His father kept telling him to get a trade; even when his son began to be successful, &quot;he was still taking the piss, saying to my friend, &apos;Do you understand what Steve does?&apos;&quot; McQueen&apos;s first film, Bear, was 10 minutes long, silent, and consisted of two naked men, one of them him, wordlessly circling each other, staring and sparring.     Deadpan 1997, a four-minute film that helped McQueen win the Turner prize in 1999. Reuters    He has never been interested in pleasing mainstream tastes, but no matter how uncompromising his work, it keeps becoming more and more popular. After winning the 1999 Turner prize with a video installation filmed from an old oil drum rolling through Manhattan, he was awarded an OBE, followed in 2011 by a\u00a0CBE. His first feature film, Hunger, released in 2008, was a\u00a0remorselessly gruelling portrayal of Bobby Sands starving himself to death in the Maze prison, and not an easy sell, but the critics went wild and McQueen won a Bafta. Shame, his second movie, could not have been a less sexy study of sex addiction, but took more than \u00a310m at the box office. The director shot his latest movie in just 35 days, with one camera and a budget of barely \u00a310m, and wasn&apos;t even confident of finding a\u00a0distributor brave enough to take it. This week 12 Years A Slave opens in Britain, having already earned $40m (\u00a325m) in US ticket sales, multiple Golden Globe nominations and countless predictions of an Academy Award that would make McQueen the first black feature film director to win an Oscar. We meet for lunch in Amsterdam, where he decided to live 16 years ago, &quot;because it&apos;s not London, it&apos;s not LA, it&apos;s not New York&quot;. He lives there with his long-term partner, a Dutch film critic, and their two children, a son and a daughter. McQueen is more elegant than photos tend to suggest, and has the most amazingly fluid face, which looks completely different from one moment to the next. His voice is never static, either, swaying between estuary mumbles and a\u00a0thespian baritone, so every few minutes it feels a bit like having lunch with someone new. But he is always businesslike and polite, and so engaged that you would never sense that this is probably the umpteenth time he has discussed his new film.     Chiwetel Ejiofor in 12 Years A Slave. Photograph: AP    12 Years A Slave is based on a book McQueen&apos;s wife came across while he was working on an idea about a free African-American from the north kidnapped into slavery in the deep south. Its author, Solomon Northup, had been exactly that: a\u00a0prosperous black New York businessman, drugged by traffickers and sold into slavery, who escaped 12 years later and published a memoir detailing the horror of Louisiana plantation life. McQueen couldn&apos;t believe his eyes. &quot;It was identical to my idea. But every turn of the page was a revelation, because you think you know what slavery is, and you&apos;re opening this book and thinking, my God. Every page was just, wow, really? It was such an eye-opener.&quot; McQueen&apos;s film pitilessly documents the beatings, lynchings, rape and brutality of a slave-owning class half-demented by its own moral corruption, and routinely reduces audiences to tears. &quot;I\u00a0hadn&apos;t realised slavery was that bad,&quot; is the comment its director keeps hearing. &quot;There&apos;s been a kind of amnesia,&quot; he says, &quot;or not wanting to focus on this, because of it being so painful. It&apos;s kind of crazy. We can deal with the second world war and the Holocaust and so forth and what not, but this side of history, maybe because it was so hideous, people just do not want to see. People do not want to engage.&quot; Only it turns out that they do. At screenings all over the US, Q&amp;A sessions have become &quot;more like town hall meetings, because people have got so much to say. It&apos;s almost like the film has given people a\u00a0platform. It&apos;s been amazing. The film has evoked a conversation about that time in history that I don&apos;t think has happened for a long, long time. It&apos;s been incredible.&quot; While thrilled by the film&apos;s reach, however, McQueen has been thrown by the unintended consequence of success: at 44, he finds himself the new darling of Hollywood. Benedict Cumberbatch co-stars alongside Michael Fassbender and Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Brad Pitt appears, too, having been quick to come on board as a\u00a0producer. Even Madonna was all over McQueen at the New York premiere \u2013 though she spent the entire film texting, which he says made him laugh. Lavished in a\u00a0froth of celebrity attention he&apos;d neither anticipated nor sought, McQueen smiles wryly, &quot;It&apos;s almost like I&apos;ve seen behind the curtains.&quot; Then the smile vanishes. &quot;You know, I&apos;m not so interested in that. I&apos;m only interested in the work. So all this chat, all this, you know, selling your soul, that&apos;s of no interest. To me, it&apos;s all about the work. It&apos;s the only thing one can do.&quot;     McQueen and Madonna at the New York premiere of 12 Years A Slave. Photograph: Rex      McQueen is a famously abrasive interviewee: one film critic who caught the sharp edge of his tongue at a recent press conference wrote that he was &quot;a dick&quot; who &quot;acts like he&apos;s genuinely baffled as to why anyone is asking him any of these questions at all&quot;. Admirers prefer to say he doesn&apos;t suffer fools gladly. But what can look deliberately obtuse or contrary is often something else. For example, critics frequently observe that all his films have dwelt on the body: Bobby Sands&apos; emaciated frame, Shame&apos;s sexual compulsions, the livid welts left by a slave owner&apos;s whip. McQueen has always claimed to have no idea what they&apos;re talking about. &quot;Well, everybody&apos;s using their body in a movie,&quot; he objects. &quot;I\u00a0mean, how are they not? I don&apos;t understand the point.&quot; But the problem turns out to be the phrase &quot;the body&quot;. He thinks it sounds pretentious. He was too embarrassed even to call himself an artist until about five years ago, for fear of sounding grand; if anyone asked what he did, he&apos;d say, &quot;I make work. I make stuff.&quot; When I\u00a0suggest &quot;physicality&quot; instead of &quot;the body&quot;, he instantly relaxes, and agrees it&apos;s a recurring theme. &quot;Yes, the physicality, the body \u2013 maybe, like, the art is the body. I suppose that&apos;s right.&quot; His work also explores the nature of authority, and the choice between collaboration and resistance. I\u00a0wonder if this is because he is curious about how he would respond in circumstances such as Northup&apos;s or Sands&apos;. &quot;I&apos;ve had no choice but to resist. For me, it&apos;s been all or nothing, that&apos;s it.&quot; I&apos;m not surprised by his answer, but I\u00a0am curious to know why. &quot;I don&apos;t know, it was all through childhood, I\u00a0think. Maybe that&apos;s the key. It all goes back to childhood.&quot; I&apos;m sure he&apos;s right. The trouble is, I&apos;ve seldom met anyone more determined to leave their childhood behind them. The most obvious theme in all three films is incarceration, physical and psychological, so I ask if he knew anyone in jail while he was growing up. He says not. Does he have any idea where the preoccupation with imprisonment comes from? &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t know. I mean, you&apos;re the journalist, that&apos;s your job. I just get on with it.&quot; Then he looks a bit put out. &quot;I think sometimes people have pre-ideas about me. I mean, I don&apos;t know how people can ask that of anyone: &apos;Have you ever been to prison?&apos;&quot; But I didn&apos;t. &quot;Yes, you did.&quot; No, I asked if he&apos;d known anyone in prison in his childhood, because incarceration is such a powerful theme in his work. &quot;I take it back, I apologise. You&apos;re absolutely right,&quot; he says at once, and thinks for a\u00a0while. &quot;Often people think they&apos;re powerless in a\u00a0situation and actually, by making some kind of efforts, you&apos;re not. You can actually break free of that. You can actually\u2026&quot; And then he breaks off. &quot;I don&apos;t know, I&apos;m struggling. I&apos;m struggling here. I&apos;ve never examined myself. This is hard because I&apos;m going back to certain times in my life I haven&apos;t really thought about for a long time. And maybe I avoided that because it was always a\u00a0very difficult time in a way, and a lot of people were damaged on that journey, friends of mine. And it was all because of people not giving a fuck.&quot; McQueen was born in west London to Grenadian parents, grew up in\u00a0leafy Ealing and went to a\u00a0very multicultural school where he was one of the cool kids, on account of being big and good at football. &quot;It was fun, we laughed all day, I didn&apos;t do any homework ever, we just laughed.&quot; When I\u00a0ask about his relationship with authority as a\u00a0child, he replies lightly, &quot;Authority was good, that wasn&apos;t a problem. I wasn&apos;t a troublemaker, I\u00a0was good.&quot; But then I ask when he has felt most powerless in his life, and his expression darkens. &quot;At school. God, that was horrible.&quot; By the age of 13, one class of academically gifted kids had been creamed off for special attention. Then there was 3C1 class: &quot;For, like, OK, normal kids.&quot; And then there was 3C2: &quot;For manual labour, more plumbers and builders, stuff like that.&quot; McQueen was put in 3C2. At first, he says mildly, &quot;I don&apos;t know why. Maybe I deserved to be,&quot; and\u00a0seems about to drop the subject. Moments later: &quot;That inequality \u2013 I\u00a0fucking loathe it with a\u00a0passion. It&apos;s all bullshit, man. It really upsets me.&quot; When he went back to present some achievement awards 15 years later, the new head admitted to him that the school had been institutionally racist. This did not come as news to McQueen. &quot;It was horrible. It was disgusting, the system, it was absolutely disgusting. It&apos;s divisive and it was hurtful. It was awful. School was painful because I\u00a0just think that loads of people, so many beautiful people, didn&apos;t achieve what they could achieve because no one believed in them, or gave them a chance, or invested any time in them. A lot of beautiful boys, talented people, were put by the wayside. School was scary for me because no one cared, and I wasn&apos;t good at it because no one cared. At 13 years old, you are marked, you are dead, that&apos;s your future.&quot; He doesn&apos;t want to think about what his future would have held had he not been able to draw. &quot;Not good. Not good.&quot; But his talent for drawing saved him, and when he stayed on to take A-level art, he got to know the kids who had been the school geeks in the higher sets. &quot;And I realised they were just so cool.&quot; They would all watch Dennis Potter&apos;s The Singing Detective and talk about it, and suddenly McQueen was having conversations he&apos;d never imagined. After a few false starts at local colleges, he applied to Chelsea College of Arts, didn&apos;t have the grades, but got in on the strength of his portfolio. Unsurprisingly, the sociocultural landscape of art school in Chelsea might as well have been another planet to McQueen. But he didn&apos;t notice. &quot;No, never. For the first time I was happy. I had an environment I could work in, and so\u00a0I was happy. I\u00a0think I&apos;m like Mr Magoo a lot of the time, you know. I\u00a0just focus \u2013 focus on my work. I\u00a0just wanted to focus on that.&quot; After graduating from Chelsea and then Goldsmiths, at the tail end of the YBA scene, when Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin were busy capturing headlines, he moved to Amsterdam. He\u00a0says he cried when his daughter started school, because &quot;it was just so beautiful, how the school was. It was so different.&quot; Private schools don&apos;t exist in Amsterdam, and the city&apos;s quiet egalitarianism had been part of its appeal. But in the past McQueen has said he chose Amsterdam chiefly because &quot;no one comes here, so I&apos;m never bothered.&quot; It occurred to him recently that he has &quot;hardly any friends&quot;, when he looked at his phonebook and realised almost every number was a work contact. &quot;But that&apos;s cool. That&apos;s good.&quot; I&apos;m getting the impression that beyond work and family, the rest of the world doesn&apos;t figure much for McQueen. &quot;It does, it does,&quot; he says at once, then stops and asks himself, &quot;How does it, Steve?&quot; Struggling to come up with an answer, he\u00a0stalls. &quot;Well, in what way, for example?&quot; Well, most people would be able to name at least one thing outside work and family that means the world to them. It could even just be a\u00a0football team. &quot;Oh well, I gave up football. It\u00a0affected my day too much. It&apos;s just stupid.&quot; He\u00a0used to be a fanatical Tottenham fan, until he\u00a0decided not to be, and he now no longer gives the\u00a0club a thought. Is\u00a0there anything else important in his life? He thinks hard, and comes up with nothing. &quot;Well, my work just takes up a\u00a0lot. I mean, I don&apos;t &apos;go to work&apos;, I don&apos;t have a\u00a0studio, it&apos;s just happening all the time, at the kitchen table, hovering, in bed. I\u00a0wouldn&apos;t call it my work. I&apos;d call it my life.&quot; It&apos;s that fusion that makes his life interesting to anyone who follows his work. But McQueen seems uncomfortable with self-examination, so I&apos;m surprised when he calls a few days later to say, &quot;I\u00a0thought we hadn&apos;t really finished the conversation last time. An hour and a half isn&apos;t long enough to get there \u2013 and I want to get there, wherever it is, I don&apos;t know.&quot; It&apos;s true, he agrees, that he doesn&apos;t like talking about his childhood. &quot;I tend to not think too much about that. But I\u00a0thought the school stuff was interesting. It was a very early stage of my life\u00a0to see the discrimination against black and working-class people, and\u00a0I needed more time to\u00a0think about that. It takes time.&quot; Then his voice becomes slightly strained. &quot;I&apos;ve never said this before, ever. But I was dyslexic. And I&apos;ve hidden it, because I was so ashamed. I\u00a0thought it meant I was stupid.&quot; He pauses. &quot;Also, I had a lazy eye. So I had a patch. When you&apos;re in\u00a0front of the chalk board, you still can&apos;t fucking see. So\u00a0it was a\u00a0terrible start. And people make judgments very quick. So you&apos;re put to one side very quickly.&quot;     Carey Mullingan in McQueen\u2019s film Shame    It&apos;s the second time McQueen has mentioned shame. The first was when he talked about learning about slavery \u2013 &quot;All I remember feeling was a real sense of shame and embarrassment about it&quot; \u2013 and that emotion may explain why he had never set foot on a film set before making Hunger, nor watched almost any other film about slavery before making 12 Years A Slave, including an earlier TV adaptation of the book. He can&apos;t remember the last time he watched his own films, and when I\u00a0ask what he&apos;s learned from earlier mistakes, says, &quot;Mistakes? I don&apos;t really believe in mistakes. I don&apos;t really have many mistakes in that way.&quot; But what can look like implacable self-belief may be the insecurity of someone who can still hear the memory of his own father&apos;s mocking scepticism, and cannot afford to entertain doubt.           His reluctance to revisit past wounds seems to have led to a blanket embargo on curiosity about himself, which I think has leaked into his work because, despite having made three films about human survival in states of extremity, none has even begun to unravel why people behave as they do. His protagonists&apos; pain is always privately contained, never shared with an intimate or explored through dialogue, so we scarcely know them any better by the final scene. Instead, his films just show what people do \u2013 in unflinching detail. So we saw exactly what excrement smeared over prison cell walls and crawling with maggots looks like, or a sex addict masturbating in a toilet cubicle, and now we see exactly what a\u00a0slave looks like hanging from a noose, while other slaves avert their gaze. But we never see inside their minds. For McQueen, the visual artist, showing what they look like is what matters.When I ask what new ideas or emotions he thinks the film offers, he admits, &quot;I don&apos;t know. I\u00a0was just interested in telling the truth by visualising it. Visualisation of this narrative hasn&apos;t been done like this before, and I\u00a0think that&apos;s the thing. I mean, some images have never been seen before. I needed to see them. It&apos;s very important. I think that&apos;s why cinema&apos;s so powerful.&quot; \u2022 12 Years A Slave is released on Friday.", "sentences": ["We meet for lunch in Amsterdam, where he decided to live 16 years ago, &quot;because it&apos;s not London, it&apos;s not LA, it&apos;s not New York&quot;.", "I\u00a0just wanted to focus on that.&quot; After graduating from Chelsea and then Goldsmiths, at the tail end of the YBA scene, when Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin were busy capturing headlines, he moved to Amsterdam.", "It was so different.&quot; Private schools don&apos;t exist in Amsterdam, and the city&apos;s quiet egalitarianism had been part of its appeal.", "But in the past McQueen has said he chose Amsterdam chiefly because &quot;no one comes here, so I&apos;m never bothered.&quot; It occurred to him recently that he has &quot;hardly any friends&quot;, when he looked at his phonebook and realised almost every number was a work contact."], "title": "Steve McQueen: my hidden shame", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/04/steve-mcqueen-my-painful-childhood-shame", "tags": ["Film", "Steve McQueen", "Culture", "Art and design", "Oscars 2014", "Oscars", "12 Years A Slave"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-01-07T16:47:07Z", "article": "My sister, Sally Le Sage, who has died aged 76, was a highly acclaimed soprano.

She toured the US and Canada with the famous Deller Consort until 1967, after which she won second prize in the prestigious International Singing Competition in s&apos;Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands.

But Mich\u00e8le Forbes, who has just published Ghost Moth \u2013 a family drama about secrets, lies and an illicit affair \u2013 is an award-winning theatre, TV and film actor who has worked as a literary reviewer for the Irish Times. Although she grew up in Belfast in the 1970s, Forbes knew she didn&apos;t want to write yet another book about the Troubles. Instead, she focuses on the period from the 1940s to the 1960s. For most of the book, we&apos;re gripped by the story of Katherine, who chooses to marry safe, reliable George, a firefighter, rather than young tailor Tom McKinley who makes her feel alive. But you\u00a0can feel political conflict approaching. The book opens in 1969 with Katherine, now a mother of four, nearly drowning when she encounters a seal in the freezing Irish Sea. It&apos;s clearly an emblem of buried turmoil. The book then tracks back 20 years to when Katherine, an amateur opera singer, meets Tom for the first time. Forbes studied English and psychology at Trinity College, Dublin. Later, she began acting with the Abbey Theatre Company, touring worldwide with such productions as The Great Hunger and Dancing at Lughnasa. Today she lives near Dalkey, Dublin, with husband, Owen Roe (last seen as Boss Finley alongside Kim Cattrall in Sweet Bird of Youth at the Old Vic), and two children. But in many ways Ghost Moth is her love\u00a0letter to Belfast, which is presented as a buzzing carefree city back in the late 1940s. There are autobiographical elements. Her Catholic mother and Protestant father fell in love at an amateur dramatics group and had four children. Her father was a fireman. Tragically, her mother died of cancer when Forbes was nine, so she is fascinated by the complex relationship between mothers and daughters, and how children handle bereavement. &quot;The novel was a way to place myself in the back garden of our house,&quot; she explains simply. &quot;I just sat there and waited to see what would happen. But then, of course, fiction takes on an energy of its own.&quot; She turned to writing for a very practical reason: &quot;I felt creatively underused.&quot; Despite winning best actress at the Monte Carlo TV festival, in 2005, for her role in Paul Greengrass and Guy Hibbert&apos;s Channel 4 film Omagh, about\u00a0the aftermath of the 1998 bombing, there aren&apos;t so many great roles for women over 40. Her short stories have received the Bryan MacMahon and the Michael McLaverty awards. It took her three years to write Ghost Moth between acting jobs. &quot;Finer details were tidied up while waiting for my children at their swimming or basketball classes, or while waiting in the car when I picked them up from school.&quot; The manuscript was knocked back by 38 Irish and UK publishers until she met US author Paul Harding at a Dublin writers&apos; workshop. His debut novel, Tinkers, had been rejected until a friend handed it to New York&apos;s Bellevue Literary Press (it went on to win the Pulitzer prize). He suggested Forbes send Bellevue Ghost Moth. The publisher snapped it up, publishing it last April. This led to a bidding war in the UK, won by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. Published in Ireland in September, it was shortlisted in the Irish book awards. Originally the heroine was to have been Katherine&apos;s nine-year-old daughter Elsa, but she became more interested in the shadowy figure of her mother. &quot;I like characters who are morally compromised,&quot; she laughs. What&apos;s interesting about Ghost Moth is there are no villains. Even dull George has his backstory. And his marriage to Katherine is not a failure. Compromise is an important part of relationships, Forbes stresses; there are riches to be mined. &quot;As John Updike puts it: it&apos;s important to give the mundane its beautiful due.&quot; Liz Hoggard  Ghost Moth is out now, published by W&amp;N, \u00a312.99 EMMA HEALEY     Emma Healey, author of Elizabeth Is Missing: 'I\u2019d sit in rooms and everyone would have read the book. It was like they\u2019d all been passing naked photos of me around.' Photograph: Katherine Rose    Detective fiction, period detail and dementia meet in a much-courted, multifaceted debut If a publisher likes a new novel, they will offer the writer a fee (often rather paltry; \u00a32,000 is typical for first-timers). If they really like it, they might accompany the offer with hand-scrawled testimonies from staff extolling the work. But if they are absolutely desperate to publish the book (and figure that others will be also), that&apos;s when they become creative. This is what happened when Emma Healey&apos;s debut novel, Elizabeth Is Missing, was presented at last year&apos;s London Book Fair. Almost immediately, nine offers were made. One was delivered with a vintage suitcase \u2013 part of the book is set in the aftermath of the second world war \u2013 filled with objects mentioned in the text: a compact, white leather gloves, a ration card.

It was all quite overwhelming for someone who&apos;d never even written a short story before starting Elizabeth Is Missing. &quot;I knew that an editor would have read the book, but I&apos;d sit in rooms and everyone would have read it,&quot; says Healey. &quot;It was like they&apos;d all been passing naked photos of me around and were coming up and saying, &apos;You looked good in that one!&apos; Or, &apos;Oh, I see that birthmark you&apos;ve got\u2026&apos; It&apos;s\u00a0like someone&apos;s been in your head, it&apos;s strange.&quot; Elizabeth Is Missing is every bit as compelling as the frenzied hype suggests. The story is narrated by Maud, an elderly woman with dementia, who realises that she hasn&apos;t seen her friend Elizabeth recently. She decides to investigate \u2013 hampered by the fact that she can&apos;t recall details from one moment to the next \u2013 and in the process unlocks memories of her sister Sukey disappearing more than half a century earlier. The novel is both a gripping detective yarn and a haunting depiction of mental illness, but also more poignant and blackly comic than you might expect from that description. Perhaps Healey&apos;s greatest achievement is the flawless voice she creates for Maud. &quot;I knew I should write about a girl in her 20s, her career in London, but I couldn&apos;t sustain any interest in that whatsoever,&quot; she laughs. &quot;One of my tutors [on the creative writing course] at the University of East Anglia said, &apos;It&apos;s someone with dementia, it&apos;s an age you&apos;ve never lived obviously, there&apos;s a mystery, she&apos;s confused, it&apos;s a dual narrative. You&apos;re trying to make it as hard as possible on yourself, aren&apos;t you?&apos; I hadn&apos;t thought about it until she said it, but God, yeah, it was a really stupid idea.&quot; For inspiration, Healey looked to her own grandmothers, one of whom suffers from dementia. Over the five years she spent writing Elizabeth Is Missing, they provided a source of anecdotes, details about the postwar years, but mostly gave her the confidence to describe Maud&apos;s mental illness in a way that is always sensitive but allows for moments of levity. &quot;I did show it to my grandmother who has dementia and that&apos;s probably the highest praise I&apos;m going to get,&quot; says Healey. &quot;She looked up a couple of times very suspiciously and said, &apos;Is this about me?&apos; Then she read it a bit more, put it down and said she didn&apos;t like it. I was like, &apos;Oh, why not?&apos; And she said, &apos;It&apos;s too real.&apos; I thought, &apos;Wow, I&apos;m never going to get anything better than that.&apos;&quot; Tim Lewis  Elizabeth Is Missing is published by Penguin Viking on 5 June, \u00a312.99 STEWART FOSTER     Stewart Foster, author of We Used to Be Kings: 'I thought, \"Oh God! I\u2019ve done it wrong. There\u2019s nothing else like it.\" But eventually I just thought, \"I\u2019ve done it differently\".' Photograph: Katherine Rose    The former pensions adviser&apos;s tale of a young man&apos;s descent into madness is spare, moving and funny When Stewart Foster was writing his novel We Used to Be Kings, he fell into a habit: every week \u2013 at least once, sometimes more \u2013 he would visit his local Waterstones in Bath and sit for hours reading the opening pages of other books. He was hoping to find something similar in style to what he was working on; proof that he had not entirely gone off the rails. He never came across anything that offered much solace. The 50-year-old Foster recalls: &quot;I&apos;d think, &apos;Oh God! I&apos;ve done it wrong. There&apos;s nothing else like it. What shall I do?&apos; But eventually I thought, &apos;I&apos;ve just done it differently.&apos;&quot; We Used to Be Kings is certainly fresh and original, a sparse and moving tale that&apos;s never showy but often dazzling. The action takes place in the 1970s, in the shadow of the space race, and follows Tom, just about to turn 18 in a care home for troubled children. Tom is accompanied everywhere he goes by his younger brother Jack who, we learn early on, died years before but has remained a real and irrepressible presence in Tom&apos;s life ever since. The pair bicker and jabber away constantly to the dismay of the doctors treating Tom. Foster handles Tom&apos;s descent into madness with empathy and humour, but he receives the compliment with bemusement. &quot;I feel like I should tell you that I researched everything but I didn&apos;t do any research at all \u2013 I just wrote it,&quot; he says. &quot;The author Ciar\u00e1n Collins described the book as a &apos;story of deep psychosis&apos;. I read that and thought, &apos;Really?&apos;&quot; Before starting to write seriously in his mid-40s, Foster was a pensions adviser for almost 25 years. He saved some money, took the plunge and began a creative writing course at Bath Spa University, sometimes driving a taxi at weekends for pocket money. &quot;I was 43; it was classic midlife,&quot; he says. &quot;But everyone says, &apos;Oh, you were so brave doing it,&apos; because it was good pay and a good job, but you don&apos;t leave jobs if you absolutely love-love-love them, do you? So it wasn&apos;t hard. It&apos;s nowhere near as great as the fear of it not working now and having to go back to not writing.&quot; A turning point for Foster came when he read Raymond Carver: &quot;I realised you didn&apos;t have to write all this exposition. You could just go bang to the story.&quot; He also began to workshop his writing with a fellow student at Bath Spa called Jonathan Bentley-Smith. They met when Bentley-Smith was 19 and he handed Foster back a short story with red ink all over it. &quot;I thought, &apos;You cheeky bugger!&apos; But I left it for a couple of days, read his comments and thought, &apos;Spot on, mate.&apos; I&apos;ve worked with him ever since; I call him the world&apos;s greatest editor.&quot; Foster admits it&apos;s an unconventional relationship, but he&apos;s beginning to realise that much of what he does is not normal writing practice. At the photo shoot for this article, a couple of the other debut authors remarked that they&apos;d worked for five years on their books and not even started their next ones. Foster has completed three novels in the same period. For a moment, he assumed he must be doing it wrong, but then he decided: &quot;I&apos;ve just done it differently.&quot; TL We Used to Be Kings is published by Jonathan Cape on 30 January, \u00a312.99 JESSIE BURTON     Jessie Burton, author of The Miniaturist: 'Being the creator of something is a real thrill.' Photograph: Katherine Rose    The former actor was the subject of a bidding war for her feminist tale set in 17th-century Amsterdam &quot;There&apos;s a sodomy trial, a hidden love, a miniaturist who predicts the fate of her customers, a parakeet called Peebo and a plan to escape to the sea,&quot; is the way actor Jessie Burton, 30, describes her debut historical novel, The Miniaturist. Last April, Burton, who has acted at the National Theatre, Donmar and Bristol Old Vic, was the subject of a six-figure bidding war. Picador snapped up The Miniaturist, billed as &quot;feminist golden-age fiction&quot;, with rights sold in 30 countries including the US, Canada and Holland. Set in 17th-century Amsterdam during the Dutch golden age, The Miniaturist tells the story of Nella, 18, who is married off to wealthy merchant Johannes. Kind but emotionally distant (his sexual desires clearly lie elsewhere), he presents her with an exact miniature replica of their home as a wedding gift. As Nella begins to furnish it, courtesy of an elusive female miniaturist, the contents start to mirror real-life dramas taking place in her own household. It&apos;s a fabulously gripping read that will appeal to fans of Girl With a Pearl Earring and The Goldfinch, but Burton is a genuinely new voice with her visceral take on sex, race and class. &quot;Donna Tartt has talked about the dream formula being compulsiveness with depth. I wanted to write a book that people wanted to read when they were tired on the tube.&quot; Burton was inspired by the cabinet house, owned by a 17th-century merchant&apos;s wife, Petronella Oortman, that is on display at Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum. &quot;Discovering that it cost the same as a full-blown house and took craftsmen 19 years to build, I asked myself, what kind of society allowed such extravagance, and why? I had the image of Nella, turning up to the house, unaware that so much adversity in this rich and hypocritical society was waiting round the corner for her.&quot; To write the book, she consulted maps, paintings, diaries, prices of food, inventories, wills. Johannes gets involved in the sugar trade \u2013 it&apos;s set at the height of Amsterdam&apos;s craving for sugar (known as lekkerheid). But she admits she upgraded the original Nella and Johannes to one of the most exclusive addresses on the Golden Bend on Amsterdam&apos;s Herengracht canal. &quot;I hope they&apos;re grateful!&quot; Born in Wimbledon, Burton attended a comprehensive in Fulham but acted from the age of five, appearing in a children&apos;s BBC drama and a Fairy liquid ad. At 18, she felt &quot;too young and nerdy&quot; for drama school, so studied English and Spanish at Oxford. But four years later, she won a place at the Central School of Speech and Drama. In between acting jobs, she temped in the City, and started writing the novel in offices and theatre dressing rooms. In 2011 she won a place on the first Curtis Brown creative writing course, which gave her &quot;time and space&quot; to finish the manuscript. She began following literary agent Juliet Mushens on Twitter and, noticing she&apos;d been reading Simon Schama&apos;s The Embarrassment of Riches, about the Dutch golden age, sent her the first three chapters of The Miniaturist. &quot;I fell in love with it and was almost bereft to finish it,&quot; recalls Mushens. A feminist, Burton writes great complex female characters who aren&apos;t just defined by what the men in their life are doing. Her favourite authors include Margaret Atwood, Siri Hustvedt, Hilary Mantel and Alice Munro. &quot;She&apos;s a cool glass of water, and then she sticks in the knife,&quot; she laughs. Burton&apos;s partner is the actor Pip Carter, who played Edward Thomas in Nick Dear&apos;s The Dark Earth and the Light Sky at the Almeida in 2012. She&apos;s delighted by his success but admits it&apos;s nice to take him to literary events for a change. And they&apos;re buying their first flat in London&apos;s Forest Hill. She&apos;ll continue to act but relishes this new freedom: &quot;When you&apos;re a writer, you are all the characters, the director and the producer. Being the actual creator of something is a real thrill.&quot; LH The Miniaturist is published by Picador on 2 July, \u00a312.99 ANNA WHITWHAM     Anna Whitwham, author of Boxer Handsome: \u2018Writing courses work if you throw yourself into them. They can be a wonderful discipline.\u2019 Photograph: Katherine Rose    It wasn&apos;t until the riots hit London that her tale of an East End amateur boxer could find a publisher Anna Whitwham&apos;s first novel does not read like a first novel. It is lean, polished and fit as its subject: Bobby is an East End amateur boxer with Belfast-Jewish roots \u2013 the Boxer Handsome of the title. The pleasure of reading the book is the sense throughout of a safe pair of hands at work on an unsafe subject \u2013 and a challenging city. This is a less-written-about London: depressed, tough and gallant (one can imagine it as a film by Ken Loach). Bobby&apos;s life is determined by cycles of violence although the novel is at pains to differentiate between the &quot;stifling machismo&quot; outside the ring\u00a0and the disciplined fighting within it. In person, Whitwham is as likably uncertain as she is decisive on the page. She is a pretty, waifish 32-year-old in jeans, jumper and blokeish black boots. The novel was inspired by her grandfather, the splendidly named John Frederick Poppy: &quot;My grandad was born between Islington and Dalston, on Mildmay Street. He had loving, wonderful parents but they were poor. He was thin, had diphtheria and got beaten up a lot. He joined the local boxing club [now the Crown &amp; Manor in Hoxton] and it was a sanctuary \u2013 life changing.&quot; He was a lightweight \u2013 he even fought at the Royal Albert Hall. He died at 98 and remained &quot;very close to the club&quot; to the end. Whitwham hasn&apos;t tried boxing herself but has watched boys sparring and says, with a wicked gleam in the eyes, that she sees boxing as &quot;noble&quot;. She points out that writers such as Joyce Carol Oates are fascinated by it as a &quot;wordless&quot; event: &quot;It has intensity, is a ritual exchange, a puritanical code you can&apos;t access if you are outside the boxing ring.&quot; She grew up in west London, her father was an English teacher, her mother a teacher of film studies. She went to Pimlico school, read drama and English at Queen&apos;s University Belfast and began by writing &quot;awful&quot; poetry. &quot;Everyone does!&quot; She studied creative writing in the US with Mona Simpson. Andrew Motion has been a tutor too. It was studying American native literature and especially Winter in the Blood by James Welch that decided her on a writing career: &quot;To this day I flag up its importance. The novel is sparse and calm. I was 21 \u2013 I loved that.&quot; She believes writing courses work if you &quot;throw yourself into them&quot;. They can be &quot;a wonderful discipline&quot;. And what has she learned? &quot;It may sound obvious or trite but what happens is that when you grow up a bit as a writer, you lose ego. You drop the need to be cool and clever and the story becomes really important. It is hard to do because when you are starting out, you want to impress.&quot; It has not been been easy getting published. It took years to find an agent \u2013 an earlier attempt at a novel came to nothing. Boxer Handsome was taken on by Simon Trewin when the riots were happening. Fortuitously helpful timing in that her book was &quot;about an England that was not being discussed&quot;. You need courage as well as talent to persevere and she has both. She is lecturing at Royal Holloway on masculinity (her PhD thesis was about representations of masculinity in contemporary literature) and laughs when I say this is brave. Then I ask if she could pinpoint what her novel has to say about masculinity. &quot;It is about men trying to perform an obsolete masculinity in an England that no longer feels the\u00a0same way about them.&quot; Kate Kellaway Boxer Handsome is published by Chatto &amp; Windus on 16 January, \u00a312.99 ZIA HAIDER RAHMAN     Zia Haider Rahman, author of In the Light of What We Know: \u2018The process is all-consuming. I wake in the morning with a dozen ideas, my head in the story all the time.\u2019 Photograph: Katherine Rose    This formidable debut deals with friendship, betrayal, class, maths, philosophy and all points in between\u2026 Zia Haider Rahman&apos;s CV is so phenomenal, one senses he keeps it brief to play it down. He does not want to dwell on it when we meet at the Wylie literary agency. But for a boy who came from a Bangladesh village after the 1971 war, was a squatter in a derelict building in Marylebone before moving to a council estate, was the son of a bus conductor (the No 7 \u2013 up the Harrow Road), was bullied and bunked off school \u2013 what happened thereafter was extraordinary. It would be extraordinary even if he had not begun life as he did. Rahman is a charming, articulate powerhouse of a man \u2013 with crushed shirt, dynamic manner and a mind that will not settle. &quot;I&apos;m fairly good at talking,&quot; he winces and smiles. He decided to have a shot at getting into Oxford and because his state school did not offer further maths, he persuaded a London crammer to coach him for free. He got into Oxford to read maths, got a first and a torrent of scholarships followed (awarded almost to the point of tedium). He went to Munich (to do German and mathematics), Cambridge (an MPhil in maths) and Yale (economics). He was headhunted and worked for Goldman Sachs on Wall Street. He reasoned the world was an unsafe place: &quot;I needed to know it. Each time I learned something about it, I was less afraid.&quot; After a couple of years, he jumped tracks: &quot;I had sought in jobs things that jobs are not good at delivering.&quot; Such as? &quot;Home \u2013 a sense of belonging\u2026&quot; His voice quietens: &quot;I carry the other Zia in my head all the time, the Zia I left behind and who didn&apos;t make it.&quot; He wanted to see if he could do some good in the world and insists he was a disappointment to his mother. When he got his first, she asked: &quot;What good is that to me?&quot; Having won the top scholarship at the bar, he became an international human rights lawyer but after another year or two, he says, his &quot;faith that one could change the world came crashing down&quot;. I suggest he is incorrigibly restless and he laughs and agrees and points out, before I get the chance, that he cannot sit still. He decided to see the world rather than attempt to change it \u2013 the plan was to travel to his village in Bangladesh. He never made it \u2013 a dear friend&apos;s mother was dying and he returned to England. Not long afterwards, he felt a new pull: to write a novel. In the Light of What We Know is a 500-pager, a holdall of a book so packed with ideas \u2013 as you might expect from a polymath \u2013 you fear its handles might break. It is set during the financial crisis and is about the darkness of what we will never know as much as the light of what we do. It is about an investment banker in London visited by Zafar, an enigmatic college friend. This formidable novel unpacks friendship, betrayal, unknowability \u2013 and includes an astute take on Englishness, on class, on mathematical theory, human rights, and whether people can trust their own perception of the world. Writing the novel is &quot;the best thing I have ever done \u2013 I don&apos;t mean the product but the process. It is all-consuming. I wake in the morning with a dozen ideas, my head in the story all the time.&quot; And was it as straightforward getting the book published as acquiring scholarships? He gives a tiny hesitation: &quot;Well, yes, actually \u2013 it was.&quot; KK In the Light of What We Know is published by Picador on 22 May, \u00a316.99 ZOE PILGER     Zoe Pilger, author of Eat My Heart Out: 'I\u2019m incapable of writing serious fiction, so it was always going to be satire.\u2019 Photograph: Katherine Rose    The art critic&apos;s biting satire on feminism, sexuality and romance asks plenty of provocative questions One of the first things Zoe Pilger remarks upon, eyeing the Dictaphone as she sits down at a table in a busy restaurant, is how odd it feels to be &quot;on the other side&quot;. As an art critic, Pilger, 29, is more used to being the interviewer than the interviewee, and is having to get used to being the subject of interest for her debut novel, Eat My Heart Out. She wrote the book in less than a year \u2013 all the while juggling her job in journalism and a PhD in contemporary art at Goldsmiths. &quot;Some writers have to have a drink to write, but I have to go to the gym, eat really healthily, and basically live like a puritan,&quot; she says, with a hint of self-deprecation. &quot;I have to be completely clear-headed, which is ironic, because a lot of the book is about hedonism and being totally out of control.&quot; A biting look at contemporary feminism, sexuality and romance, the book follows several days in the life of Ann-Marie, a socially inept 23-year-old failed Cambridge student whose love life gets more complicated when she becomes the protegee of a famous and radical second-wave feminist. &quot;I wanted to write about feminism through fiction, and dark comedy. For some reason I&apos;m incapable of writing serious fiction, so it was always going to be satire,&quot; Pilger explains, laughing. Although she also studied at Cambridge for her BA in social and political science, she says the book is in no way autobiographical, unlike the work of Lena Dunham, with whom Pilger (also in her late 20s) has already been aligned. Ann-Marie is impulsive and fiery (like Dunham&apos;s protagonist in Girls), whereas Pilger is a calm, warm presence, and speaks eloquently, in measured sentences. She references lesser-known experimental authors such as Anna Kavan, Jane Bowles and Mary Gaitskill \u2013 &quot;writers who say different and more interesting things about femininity&quot; \u2013 as her inspiration, admiring in particular the &quot;fearlessness&quot; of Kathy Acker&apos;s Blood and Guts in High School: &quot;It&apos;s still challenging for women to express that kind of anger and frustration.&quot; In Eat My Heart Out, it is Pilger&apos;s frustration with the regression of feminism that underpins much of Ann-Marie&apos;s experiences. &quot;Obviously I&apos;m not a prude and I wouldn&apos;t advocate a return to no-sex-before-marriage, but I think the effects of [our] supposedly permissive culture have been really underexamined.&quot; As the daughter of journalists Yvonne Roberts and John Pilger, her family and upbringing were &quot;very political&quot;, and she admires the baby boomer generation&apos;s strong sense of political possibility. &quot;I&apos;m pleased that in the past couple of years there seems to have been a real increase of interest in feminism among young women,&quot; she says. But in pondering the complicated relationship between romance and feminism, Pilger is more interested in raising questions than answering them: &quot;There aren&apos;t really any answers in the book, I hope. But I do hope it might start conversations around the sort of things it discusses. That&apos;s what I&apos;m looking forward to.&quot; Corinne Jones  Eat My Heart Out is published by Serpent&apos;s Tail on 30 January, \u00a311.99", "sentences": ["Photograph: Katherine Rose    The former actor was the subject of a bidding war for her feminist tale set in 17th-century Amsterdam &quot;There&apos;s a sodomy trial, a hidden love, a miniaturist who predicts the fate of her customers, a parakeet called Peebo and a plan to escape to the sea,&quot; is the way actor Jessie Burton, 30, describes her debut historical novel, The Miniaturist.", "Set in 17th-century Amsterdam during the Dutch golden age, The Miniaturist tells the story of Nella, 18, who is married off to wealthy merchant Johannes.", "I wanted to write a book that people wanted to read when they were tired on the tube.&quot; Burton was inspired by the cabinet house, owned by a 17th-century merchant&apos;s wife, Petronella Oortman, that is on display at Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum.", "Johannes gets involved in the sugar trade \u2013 it&apos;s set at the height of Amsterdam&apos;s craving for sugar (known as lekkerheid).", "But she admits she upgraded the original Nella and Johannes to one of the most exclusive addresses on the Golden Bend on Amsterdam&apos;s Herengracht canal."], "title": "Meet the debut authors of 2014", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/12/debut-authors-2014-observer-fiction", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-01-12T09:00:00Z", "article": "Edge.org was launched in 1996 as the online version of &quot;the Reality Club&quot;, an informal gathering of intellectuals who met from 1981 to 1996 in Chinese restaurants, artist lofts, investment banking firms, ballrooms, museums, living rooms and elsewhere. Though the venue is now in cyberspace, the spirit of the Reality Club lives on in the lively back-and-forth discussions on the hot-button ideas driving the discussion today.  The online salon at edge.org is a living document of millions of words charting the Edge conversation over the past 15 years. It is available, gratis, to the general public. As the late artist James Lee Byars and I once wrote: &quot;To accomplish the extraordinary, you must seek extraordinary people.&quot; At the centre of every Edge project are remarkable people and remarkable minds \u2013 scientists, artists, philosophers, technologists and entrepreneurs. Through the years, edge.org has had a simple criterion for choosing contributors. We look for people whose creative work has expanded our notion of who and what we are. A few are bestselling authors or are famous in the mass culture. Most are not. Rather, we encourage work on the cutting edge of the culture, and the investigation of ideas that have not been generally exposed. We are interested in &quot;thinking smart&quot;; we are not interested in received &quot;wisdom&quot;.  In the words of the novelist Ian McEwan, edge.org is &quot;open-minded, free-ranging, intellectually playful\u2026 an unadorned pleasure in curiosity, a collective expression of wonder at the living and inanimate world\u2026 an ongoing and thrilling colloquium.&quot; At the end of the year in 1999, for the first anniversary edition of Edge, I asked a number of thinkers to use the interrogative. I asked &quot;the most subtle sensibilities in the world what question they are asking themselves&quot;. We&apos;ve been doing it annually ever since.  It&apos;s not easy coming up with a question. James Lee, whose 1971 conceptual art piece The World Question Centre inspired the annual Edge question, used to say: &quot;I can answer the question, but am I bright enough to ask it?&quot; We are looking for questions that inspire answers we can&apos;t possibly predict. My goal is to provoke people into thinking thoughts that they normally might not have.  We pay a lot of attention to framing the question and soliciting early responses from individuals who can set a high bar. This is critical. These responses seed the site and challenge and encourage the wider group to think in surprising ways.  The online publication of\u00a0the annual question occurs in mid-January,\u00a0and in recent years it is followed by a printed book. Last year we worried about worrying. This year&apos;s question comes from HeadCon 13, a two-day Edge seminar that took place in September last year. At one point, Yale psychologist Laurie Santos mentioned to the group that she was interested in why there was no mechanism in social science for retiring ideas in order to make room for new initiatives. A lively discussion followed and I quickly picked up on it as an indication that Santos was on to a possible Edge question. After two weeks of often intense conversations, several Edgies expressed concern that the responses would go negative and that people would use it as an opportunity to trash their rivals. Others pointed out that every year, no matter what question is asked, people try to do this in any case. We decided to go with it after one Edgie commented: &quot;Science is argument, not advertising.&quot; Thus I am pleased to present the Edge question 2014, asked by Laurie Santos. MOUSE MODELS     Azra Raza    AZRA RAZAProfessor of medicine and director of the MDS Centre, Columbia University, New York An obvious truth that is either being ignored or going unaddressed in cancer research is that mouse models do not mimic human disease well and are essentially worthless for drug development. We cured acute leukaemia in mice in 1977 with drugs that we are still using in exactly the same dose and duration today in humans with dreadful results. Imagine the artificiality of taking human tumour cells, growing them in lab dishes, then transferring them to mice whose immune systems have been compromised so they cannot reject the implanted tumours, and then exposing these &quot;xenografts&quot; to drugs whose killing efficiency and toxicity profiles will then be applied to treat human cancers. The pitfalls of such an entirely synthesized non-natural model system have also plagued other disciplines. A recent scientific paper showed that all 150 drugs tested at the cost of billions of dollars in human trials of sepsis failed because the drugs had been developed using mice. Unfortunately, what looks like sepsis in mice turned out to be very different than what sepsis is in humans. Coverage of this study by Gina Kolata in the New York Times incited a heated response from within the biomedical research community. One blogger said: &quot;There is no basis for leveraging a niche piece of research to imply that mice are useless models for all human diseases.&quot; In an article for the Jackson Laboratory, three leading physician scientists concluded: &quot;The key is to construct the appropriate mouse models and design the experimental conditions that mirror the human situation.&quot; The problem is there are no appropriate mouse models that can mimic the human situation. So why is the cancer research community continuing to be dominated by the dysfunctional tradition of employing mouse models to test hypotheses for development of new drugs? Robert Weinberg of the Whitehead Institute at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] has provided the best answer. He was quoted in the press, noting: &quot;[There are] two reasons. First, there&apos;s no other model with which to replace that poor mouse. Second, the FDA [the US Food and Drugs Administration] has created inertia because it continues to recognise these models as the gold standard for predicting the utility of drugs.&quot; There is a third reason related more to the frailties of human nature. Too many eminent laboratories and illustrious researchers have devoted entire lives to studying malignant diseases in mouse models and they are the ones reviewing one another&apos;s grants and deciding where the NIH money [US government medical research funding] gets spent. They are not prepared to accept that mouse models are basically valueless for most of cancer therapeutics. In the final analysis then, one of the main reasons we continue to stick to this archaic ethos is to obtain funding. Here is one example. I decided to study a bone marrow malignant disease called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which frequently evolves into acute leukaemia, back in the early 1980s. One decision I made very early on was to concentrate my research on freshly obtained human cells and not to rely on mice or petri dishes alone. In the past three decades, I have collected more than 50,000 bone marrow biopsies, blood, normal control buccal smear cells [cells taken from inside the cheek], serum and plasma samples in a well-annotated tissue repository backed by a computerised bank of clinical, pathologic and morphologic data. By using these samples, we have identified novel genes involved in causing certain types of MDS, as well as sets of genes related to survival, natural history of the disease and response to therapy. But when I used bone marrow cells from treated MDS patients to develop a genomic expression profile which was startlingly predictive of response and applied for an NIH grant to validate the signature, the main criticism was that before confirming it through a prospective trial in humans, I should first reproduce it in mice! The time is here to let go of the mouse models at least as surrogates for bringing drugs to the bedside. Remember what Mark Twain said. &quot;What gets us into trouble is not what we don&apos;t know; it&apos;s what we know for sure that just ain&apos;t so.&quot; THERE CAN BE NO SCIENCE OF ART     Jonathan Gottschall. Photograph: Samuel Fee    JONATHAN GOTTSCHALLUS academic and author who specialises in literature and evolution and teaches at Washington &amp; Jefferson College, Pennsylvania Fifteen thousand years ago in France, a sculptor swam and slithered almost a kilometre down into a mountain cave. Using clay, the artist shaped a big bull rearing up to mount a cow, and then left his creation in the bowels of the earth. The two bison of the Tuc D&apos;Audoubert caves sat undisturbed for many thousands of years until they were rediscovered by spelunking boys [cavers] in 1912. The discovery of the clay bison was one of many shocking 20th-century discoveries of sophisticated cave art stretching back tens of thousands of years. The discoveries overturned our sense of what our caveman ancestors were like. They were not furry, grunting troglodytes. They had artistic souls. They showed us that humans are \u2013 by nature, not just by culture \u2013 art-making, art-consuming, art-addicted apes. But why? Why did the sculptor burrow into the earth, make art, and leave it there in the dark? And why does art exist in the first place? Scholars have spun a lot of stories in answer to such questions, but the truth is that we really don&apos;t know. And here&apos;s one reason why: science is lying down on the job. A long time ago someone proclaimed that art could not be studied scientifically, and for some reason almost everyone believed it. The humanities and sciences constituted, as Stephen Jay Gould might have proclaimed, separate, non-overlapping magisteria \u2013 that the tools of the one are radically unsuited to the other.     The prehistoric bison carving at the Tuc D\u2019Audoubert caves in France: \u2018Our caveman ancestors had artistic souls.\u2019     Science has mostly bought into this. How else can we explain its neglect of the arts? People live in art. We read stories, and watch them on TV, and listen to them in song. We make paintings and gaze at them on walls. We beautify our homes like bowerbirds adorning nests. We demand beauty in the products we buy, which explains the gleam of our automobiles and the sleek modernist aesthetic of our iPhones. We make art out of our own bodies: sculpting them through diet and exercise; festooning them with jewellery and colourful garments; using our skins as living canvas for the display of tattoos. And so it is the world over. As the late Denis Dutton argued in The Art Instinct, underneath the cultural variations, &quot;all human beings have essentially the same art&quot;. Our curious love affair with art sets our species apart as much as our sapience or our language or our use of tools. And yet we understand so little about art. We don&apos;t know why art exists in the first place. We don&apos;t know why we crave beauty. We don&apos;t know how art produces its effects in our brains \u2013 why one arrangement of sound or colour pleases while another cloys. We don&apos;t know very much about the precursors of art in other species, and we don&apos;t know when humans became creatures of art. (According to one influential theory, art arrived 50,000 years ago with a kind of creative big bang. If that&apos;s true, how did that happen?) We don&apos;t even have a good definition, in truth, of what art is. In short, there is nothing so central to human life that is so incompletely understood. Recent years have seen more use of scientific tools and methods in humanities subjects. Neuroscientists can show us what&apos;s happening in the brain when we enjoy a song or study a painting. Psychologists are studying the ways novels and TV shows shape our politics and our morality. Evolutionary psychologists and literary scholars are teaming up to explore narrative&apos;s Darwinian origins. And other literary scholars are developing a &quot;digital humanities&quot; using algorithms to extract big data from digitised literature. But scientific work in the humanities has mainly been scattered, preliminary, and desultory. It does not constitute a research programme. If we want better answers to fundamental questions about art, science must jump in the game with both feet. Going it alone, humanities scholars can tell intriguing stories about the origins and significance of art, but they don&apos;t have the tools to patiently winnow the field of competing ideas. That&apos;s what the scientific method is for: separating the stories that are more accurate, from the stories that are less accurate. But make no mistake, a strong science of art will require both the thick, granular expertise of humanities scholars and the clever hypothesis testing of scientists. I&apos;m not calling for a scientific takeover of the arts. I&apos;m calling for a partnership. This partnership faces great obstacles. There&apos;s the unexamined assumption that something in art makes it science-proof. There&apos;s a widespread, if usually unspoken, belief that art is just a frill in human life \u2013 relatively unimportant compared with the weighty stuff of science. And there&apos;s the weird idea that science necessarily destroys the beauty it seeks to explain (as though a learned astronomer really could dull the star shine). But the Delphic admonition &quot;know thyself&quot; still rings out as the great prime directive of intellectual inquiry, and there will always be a gaping hole in human self-knowledge until we develop a science of art. ADDICTION     Author Helen Fisher. Photograph: Rafael Fuchs    HELEN FISHERBiological anthropologist at Rutgers University, New Jersey and author of Why Him? Why Her? How to Find and Keep Lasting Love &quot;If an idea is not absurd, there is no hope for it,&quot; Einstein reportedly said. I would like to broaden the definition of addiction and retire the scientific idea that all addictions are pathological and harmful. Since the beginning of formal diagnostics more than 50 years ago, the compulsive pursuit of gambling, food, and sex (known as non-substance rewards) have not been regarded as addictions; only abuse of alcohol, opioids, cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis, heroin and nicotine have been formally regarded as addictions. This categorisation rests largely on the fact that substances activate basic &quot;reward pathways&quot; in the brain associated with craving and obsession, and produce pathological behaviours. Psychiatrists work within this world of psychopathology \u2013 that which is abnormal and makes you ill. As an anthropologist, they appear limited by this view. Scientists have now shown that food, sex and gambling compulsions employ many of the same brain pathways activated by substance abuse. Indeed, the 2013 edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM) has finally acknowledged that at least one form of non-substance abuse can be regarded as an addiction: gambling. The abuse of sex and food were not included. Neither was romantic love. I shall propose that love addiction is just as real as any other addiction, in terms of its behaviour patterns and brain mechanisms. Moreover, it&apos;s often a positive addiction. Scientists and laymen have long regarded romantic love as part of the supernatural, or as a social invention of the troubadours in 12th-century France. Evidence does not support these notions. Love songs, poems, stories, operas, ballets, novels, myths and legends, love magic, love charms, love suicides and homicides: evidence of romantic love has now been found in more than 200 societies ranging over thousands of years. Around the world men and women pine for love, live for love, kill for love and die for love. Human romantic love, also known as passionate love or &quot;being in love&quot; is regularly regarded as a human universal. Moreover, love-besotted men and women show all of the basic symptoms of addiction. Foremost, the lover is stiletto-focused on his/her drug of choice: the love object. They think obsessively about &quot;him&quot; or &quot;her&quot; (intrusive thinking), and often compulsively call, write, or appear, to stay in touch. Paramount to this experience is intense motivation to win their sweetheart, not unlike the substance abuser fixated on his/her drug. Impassioned lovers also distort reality, change their priorities and daily habits to accommodate the beloved, experience personality changes (affect disturbance), and sometimes do inappropriate or risky things to impress this special other. Many are willing to sacrifice, even die for &quot;him&quot; or &quot;her&quot;. The lover craves emotional and physical union with their beloved too (dependence). And like the addict who suffers when they can&apos;t get their drug, the lover suffers when apart from the beloved (separation anxiety). Adversity and social barriers even heighten this longing (frustration attraction). In fact, besotted lovers express all four of the basic traits of addiction: craving; tolerance; withdrawal; and relapse. They feel a &quot;rush&quot; of exhilaration when with their beloved (intoxication). As their tolerance builds, the lover seeks to interact with the beloved more and more (intensification). If the love object breaks off the relationship, the lover experiences signs of drug withdrawal, including protest, crying spells, lethargy, anxiety, insomnia or hypersomnia, loss of appetite or binge eating, irritability and loneliness. Lovers, like addicts, also often go to extremes, sometimes doing degrading or physically dangerous things to win back the beloved. And lovers relapse the way drug addicts do: long after the relationship is over, events, people, places, songs or other external cues associated with their abandoning sweetheart can trigger memories and renewed craving. Of the many indications that romantic love is an addiction, however, perhaps none is more convincing than the growing data from neuroscience. Using brain scanning (functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI), several scientists have now shown that feelings of intense romantic love engage regions of the brain&apos;s &quot;reward system,&quot; specifically dopamine pathways associated with energy, focus, motivation, ecstasy, despair and craving \u2013 including primary regions associated with substance (and non-substance) addictions. In fact, our group has found activity in the nucleus accumbens \u2013 the core brain factory associated with all addictions \u2013 in our rejected lovers. Moreover, some of our newest (unpublished) results suggest correlations between activities of the nucleus accumbens and feelings of romantic passion among lovers who were wildly, happily in love. Nobel laureate Eric Kandel recently said: &quot;Brain studies will ultimately tell us what it is like to be human.&quot; Knowing what we now know about the brain, my brain-scanning partner, Lucy Brown, has suggested that romantic love is a natural addiction; and I have maintained that this natural addiction evolved from mammalian antecedents some 4.4m years ago among our first hominid ancestors, in conjunction with the evolution of (serial, social) monogamy \u2013 a hallmark of humankind. Its purpose: to motivate our forebears to focus their mating time and metabolic energy on a single partner at a time, thus initiating the formation of a pair-bond to rear their young (at least through infancy) together as a team. The sooner we embrace what brain science is telling us \u2013 and use this information to upgrade the concept of addiction \u2013 the better we will understand ourselves and all the billions of others on this planet who revel in the ecstasy and struggle with the sorrow of this profoundly powerful, natural, often positive addiction: romantic love. THE LINEAR NO-THRESHOLD RADIATION DOSE HYPOTHESIS     Stewart Brand. Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images    STEWART BRANDAuthor and founder of The Whole Earth Catalog; co-founder of The Well and The Long Now Foundation In his 1976 book, A Scientist at the White House, George Kistiakowsky, President Eisenhower&apos;s science adviser, told us what he wrote in his diary in 1960 on being exposed to the idea by the Federal Radiation Council: It is a rather appalling document that takes 140 pages to state the simple fact that, since we know virtually nothing about the dangers of low-intensity radiation, we might as well agree that the average population dose from manmade radiation should be no greater than that which the population already receives from natural causes; and that any individual in that population shouldn&apos;t be exposed to more than three times that amount, the latter figure being, of course, totally arbitrary. Later in the book, Kistiakowsky, who was a nuclear expert and veteran of the Manhattan Project, wrote: &quot;\u2026 a linear relation between dose and effect\u2026 I still believe is entirely unnecessary for the definition of the current radiation guidelines, since they are pulled out of thin air without any knowledge on which to base them.&quot; Sixty-three years of research on radiation effects have gone by, and Kistiakowsky&apos;s critique still holds. The linear no-threshold (LNT) radiation dose hypothesis, which surreally influences every regulation and public fear about nuclear power, is based on no knowledge whatever.     Panic-mongers said Fukushima would kill thousands, but no one has died. Rex Photograph: KeystoneUSA-ZUMA/Rex Features    At stake are the hundreds of billions spent on meaningless levels of &quot;safety&quot; around nuclear power plants and waste storage, the projected costs of next-generation nuclear plant designs to reduce greenhouse gases worldwide, and the extremely harmful episodes of public panic that accompany rare radiation-release events such as Fukushima and Chernobyl. (No birth defects whatever were caused by Chernobyl, but fear of them led to 100,000 panic abortions in the Soviet Union and Europe. What people remember about Fukushima is that nuclear opponents predicted that hundreds or thousands would die or become ill from the radiation. In fact nobody died, nobody became ill, and nobody is expected to.) The &quot;linear&quot; part of the LNT is true and well documented. Based on long-term studies of survivors of the atomic bombs in Japan and of nuclear industry workers, the incidence of eventual cancer increases with increasing exposure to radiation at levels above 100 millisieverts per year. The effect is linear. Below 100 millisieverts per year, however, no increased cancer incidence has been detected, either because it doesn&apos;t exist or because the numbers are so low that any signal gets lost in the epidemiological noise. We all die. Nearly a half of us die of cancer (38% of females, 45% of males). If the &quot;no-threshold&quot; part of the LNT is taken seriously, and an exposed population experiences as much as a 0.5% increase in cancer risk, it simply cannot be detected. The LNT operates on the unprovable assumption that the cancer deaths exist, even if the increase is too small to detect, and that therefore &quot;no level of radiation is safe&quot; and every extra millisievert is a public health hazard. Some evidence against the &quot;no-threshold&quot; hypothesis draws on studies of background radiation. In the US we are all exposed to 6.2\u00a0millisieverts a year on average, but it varies regionally. New England has lower background radiation, Colorado is much higher, yet cancer rates in New England are higher than in Colorado \u2013 an inverse effect. Some places in the world, such as Ramsar in Iran, have a tenfold higher background radiation, but no higher cancer rates have been discovered there. These results suggest that there is indeed a threshold below which radiation is not harmful. Furthermore, recent research at the cell level shows a number of mechanisms for repair of damaged DNA and for ejection of damaged cells up to significant radiation levels. This is not surprising given that life evolved amid high radiation and other threats to DNA. The DNA repair mechanisms that have existed in yeast for 800m years are also present in humans. The actual threat of low-dose radiation to humans is so low that the LNT hypothesis can neither be proven true nor proven false, yet it continues to dominate and misguide policies concerning radiation exposure, making them grotesquely conservative and expensive. Once the LNT is explicitly discarded, we can move on to regulations that reflect only discernible, measurable medical effects, and that respond mainly to the much larger considerations of whole-system benefits and harms. The most crucial decisions about nuclear power are at the category level of world urban prosperity and climate change, not imaginary cancers per millisievert. HUMANIQUENESS     Irene Pepperberg.    IRENE PEPPERBERGResearch associate and lecturer at Harvard specialising in animal thought processes, and author of Alex &amp; Me Yes, humans do some things that other species do not \u2013 we are indeed the only species to send probes to outer space to find other forms of life \u2013 but the converse is certainly equally true. Other species do things humans find impossible, and many non-human species are indeed unique in their abilities. No human can detect temperature changes of a few hundredths of a degree as can some pit vipers, nor can humans best a dog at following faint scents. Dolphins hear at ranges impossible for humans and, along with bats, can use natural sonar. Bees and many birds see in the ultraviolet, and many birds migrate thousands of miles yearly under their own power, with what seems to be some kind of internal GPS. Humans, of course, can and will invent machines to accomplish such feats of nature, unlike our non-human brethren \u2013 but non-humans had these abilities first. Clearly I don&apos;t contest data that show that humans are unique in many ways, and I certainly favour studying the similarities and differences across species, but think it is time to retire the notion that human uniqueness is a pinnacle of some sort, denied in any shape, way, or form to other creatures. Another reason for retiring the idea of humaniqueness as the ideal endpoint of some evolutionary process is, of course, that our criteria for uniqueness inevitably need redefinition. Remember when &quot;man, the tool-user&quot; was our definition? At least until along came species like cactus-spike-using Galapagos finches, sponge-wielding dolphins, and now even crocodiles that use sticks to lure birds to their demise. Then it was &quot;man, the tool-maker&quot;\u2026 but that fell out of favour when such behaviour was seen in a number of other creatures, including species so evolutionary-distant from humans as New Caledonian crows. Learning through imitation? Almost all songbirds do it to some extent vocally, and minor evidence exists for physical aspects in parrots and apes. I realise that current research does demonstrate that apes, for example, are lacking in certain aspects of collaborative abilities seen in humans, but have to wonder if different experimental protocols might provide different data in the future. The comparative study of behaviour needs to be expanded and supported, but not merely to find more data enshrining humans as &quot;special&quot;. Finding out what makes us different from other species is a worthy enterprise, but it can also lead us to find out what is &quot;special&quot; about other beings, what incredible things we may need to learn from them. So, for example, we need more studies to determine the extent to which non-humans show empathy or exhibit various aspects of &apos;theory of mind&quot;, to learn what is needed for survival in both their natural environment and what they can acquire when enculturated into ours. Maybe they have other means of accomplishing the social networking we take as at least a partial requisite for humanness. We need to find out what aspects of human communication skills they can acquire \u2013 but we also can&apos;t lose sight of the need to uncover the complexities that exist in their own communication systems. Nota Bene lest my point be misunderstood: my argument is a different one from that of bestowing personhood on various non-human species, and is separate from other arguments for animal rights and even animal welfare \u2013 although I can see the possible implications of what I am proposing. All told, it seems to me that it is time to continue to study all the complexities of behaviour in all species, human and non-human, to concentrate on similarities as well as differences, and \u2013 in many cases \u2013 to appreciate the inspiration that our non-human compatriots provide in order to develop tools and skills that enhance our own abilities, rather than simply to consign non-humans to a second-class status. THINGS ARE EITHER TRUE OR FALSE     Actor Alan Alda. Photograph: ASSOCIATED PRESS    ALAN ALDAAmerican actor, writer, director and author of Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself The idea that things are either true or false should possibly take a rest. I&apos;m not a scientist, just a lover of science, so I might be speaking out of turn \u2013 but like all lovers I think about my beloved a lot. I want her to be free and productive, and not misunderstood. For me, the trouble with truth is that not only is the notion of eternal, universal truth highly questionable, but simple, local truths are subject to refinement as well. Up is up and down is down, of course. Except under special circumstances. Is the north pole up and the south pole down? Is someone standing at one of the poles right-side up or upside-down? Kind of depends on your perspective. When I studied how to think in school I was taught that the first rule of logic was that a thing cannot both be and not be at the same time and in the same respect. That last note, &quot;in the same respect,&quot; says a lot. As soon as you change the frame of reference, you&apos;ve changed the truthiness of a once immutable fact. Death seems pretty definite. The body is just a lump. Life is gone. But if you step back a bit, the body is actually in a transitional phase while it slowly turns into compost \u2013 capable of living in another way. This is not to say that nothing is true or that everything is possible \u2013 just that it might not be so helpful for things to be known as true for all time, without a disclaimer. At the moment, the way it&apos;s presented to us, astrology is highly unlikely to be true. But if it turns out that organic stuff once bounced off Mars and hit Earth with a dose of life, we might have to revise some statements that planets do not influence our lives here on Earth. I wonder, and this is just a modest proposal, if scientific truth should be identified in a way that acknowledges that it&apos;s something we know and understand for now \u2013 and in a certain way. One of the major ways the public comes to mistrust science is when they feel that scientists can&apos;t make up their minds. One says red wine is good for you, and another says even in small amounts it can be harmful. In turn, some people think science is just another belief system. Scientists and science writers make a real effort to deal with this all the time. The phrase &quot;current research suggests&quot; warns us that it&apos;s not a fact yet. But, from time to time the full-blown factualness of something is declared, even though further work could place it within a new frame of reference. And then the public might wonder if the scientists are just arguing for their pet ideas. Facts, it seems to me, are workable units, useful in a given frame or context. They should be as exact and irrefutable as possible, tested by experiment to the fullest extent. When the frame changes, they don&apos;t need to be discarded as untrue, but respected as still useful within their domain. I think most people who work with facts accept this, but I don&apos;t think the public fully gets it. That&apos;s why I hope for more wariness about implying we know something to be true or false for all time and for everywhere in the cosmos. Especially if we happen to be upside down when we say it. BEWARE OF ARROGANCE: RETIRE NOTHING!     Ian McEwan. Photograph: Murdo Macleod    IAN McEWANNovelist; author of many books including Sweet Tooth; Solar; On Chesil Beach and Amsterdam (winner of the Man Booker prize for fiction) A great and rich scientific tradition should hang on to everything it has. Truth is not the only measure. There are ways of being wrong that help others to be right. Some are wrong, but brilliantly so. Some are wrong but contribute to method. Some are wrong but help found a discipline. Aristotle ranged over the whole of human knowledge and was wrong about much. But his invention of zoology alone was priceless. Would you cast him aside? You never know when you might need an old idea. It could rise again one day to enhance a perspective the present cannot imagine. It would not be available to us if it were fully retired.      Aristotle: even his mistakes are worth preserving. Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images    Even Darwin in the early 20th century experienced some neglect, until the modern [evolutionary] synthesis. The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals took longer to be current. William James also languished, as did psychology, once consciousness as a subject was retired from it. Look at the revived fortunes of Thomas Bayes and Adam Smith (especially The Theory of Moral Sentiments). We may need to take another look at the long-maligned Descartes. Epigenetics might even restore the reputation of Lamarck. Freud may yet have something to tell us about the unconscious. Every last serious and systematic speculation about the world deserves to be preserved. We need to remember how we got to where we are, and we&apos;d like the future not to retire us. Science should look to literature and maintain a vibrant living history as a monument to ingenuity and persistence. We won&apos;t retire Shakespeare. Nor should we Bacon. ESSENTIALISM     Richard Dawkins: 'I'm occasionally tempted by the view that maybe it would be a shame if Christianity died.' Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer    RICHARD DAWKINSEvolutionary biologist; professor of the public understanding of science, Oxford; author of The Magic of Reality Essentialism \u2013 what I&apos;ve called &quot;the tyranny of the discontinuous mind&quot; \u2013 stems from Plato, with his characteristically Greek geometer&apos;s view of things. For Plato, a circle or a right-angled triangle were ideal forms, definable mathematically but never realised in practice. A circle drawn in the sand was an imperfect approximation to the ideal Platonic circle hanging in some abstract space. That works for geometric shapes like circles, but essentialism has been applied to living things and Ernst Mayr blamed this for humanity&apos;s late discovery of evolution \u2013 as late as the 19th century. If, like Aristotle, you treat all flesh-and-blood rabbits as imperfect approximations to an ideal Platonic rabbit, it won&apos;t occur to you that rabbits might have evolved from a non-rabbit ancestor, and might evolve into a non-rabbit descendant. If you think, following the dictionary definition of essentialism, that the essence of rabbitness is &quot;prior to&quot; the existence of rabbits (whatever &quot;prior to&quot; might mean, and that&apos;s a nonsense in itself) evolution is not an idea that will spring readily to your mind, and you may resist when somebody else suggests it. Paleontologists will argue passionately about whether a particular fossil is, say, Australopithecus or Homo. But any evolutionist knows there must have existed individuals who were exactly intermediate. It&apos;s essentialist folly to insist on the necessity of shoehorning your fossil into one genus or the other. There never was an Australopithecus mother who gave birth to a Homo child, for every child ever born belonged to the same species as its mother. The whole system of labelling species with discontinuous names is geared to a time slice, the present, in which ancestors have been conveniently expunged from our awareness (and &quot;ring species&quot; tactfully ignored). If by some miracle every ancestor were preserved as a fossil, discontinuous naming would be impossible. Creationists are misguidedly fond of citing &quot;gaps&quot; as embarrassing for evolutionists, but gaps are a fortuitous boon for taxonomists who, with good reason, want to give species discrete names. Quarrelling about whether a fossil is &quot;really&quot; Australopithecus or Homo is like quarrelling over whether George should be called &quot;tall&quot;. He&apos;s 5ft 10, doesn&apos;t that tell you what you need to know? Essentialism rears its ugly head in racial terminology. The majority of &quot;African Americans&quot; are of mixed race. Yet so entrenched is our essentialist mindset that American official forms require everyone to tick one race/ethnicity box or another: no room for intermediates. A different but also pernicious point is that a person will be called &quot;African American&quot; even if only, say, one of his eight great grandparents was of African descent. As Lionel Tiger put it to me, we have here a reprehensible &quot;contamination metaphor&quot;. But I mainly want to call attention to our society&apos;s essentialist determination to dragoon a person into one discrete category or another. We seem ill-equipped to deal mentally with a continuous spectrum of intermediates. We are still infected with the plague of Plato&apos;s essentialism. Moral controversies such as those over abortion and euthanasia are riddled with the same infection. At what point is a brain-dead accident-victim defined as &quot;dead&quot;? At what moment during development does an embryo become a &quot;person&quot;? Only a mind infected with essentialism would ask such questions. An embryo develops gradually from single-celled zygote to newborn baby, and there&apos;s no one instant when &quot;personhood&quot; should be deemed to have arrived. The world is divided into those who get this truth and those who wail: &quot;But there has to be some moment when the foetus becomes human.&quot; No, there really doesn&apos;t, any more than there has to be a day when a middle-aged person becomes old. It would be better \u2013 though still not ideal \u2013 to say the embryo goes through stages of being a quarter human, half human, three quarters human\u2026 The essentialist mind will recoil from such language and accuse me of all manner of horrors for denying the essence of humanness. Evolution too, like embryonic development, is gradual. Every one of our ancestors, back to the common root we share with chimpanzees and beyond, belonged to the same species as its own parents and its own children. And likewise for the ancestors of a chimpanzee, back to the same shared progenitor. We are linked to modern chimpanzees by a V-shaped chain of individuals who once lived and breathed and reproduced, each link in the chain being a member of the same species as its neighbours in the chain, no matter that taxonomists insist on dividing them at convenient points and thrusting discontinuous labels upon them. If all the intermediates, down both forks of the V from the shared ancestor, had happened to survive, moralists would have to abandon their essentialist, &quot;speciesist&quot; habit of placing Homo sapiens on a sacred plinth, infinitely separate from all other species. Abortion would no more be &quot;murder&quot; than killing a chimpanzee \u2013 or, by extension, any animal. Indeed an early-stage human embryo, with no nervous system and presumably lacking pain and fear, might defensibly be afforded less moral protection than an adult pig, which is clearly well equipped to suffer. Our essentialist urge toward rigid definitions of &quot;human&quot; (in debates over abortion and animal rights) and &quot;alive&quot; (in debates over euthanasia and end-of-life decisions) makes no sense in the light of evolution and other gradualistic phenomena. We define a poverty &quot;line&quot;: you are either &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; it. But poverty is a continuum. Why not say, in dollar equivalents, how poor you actually are? The preposterous electoral college system in US presidential elections is another, and especially grievous, manifestation of essentialist thinking. Florida must go either wholly Republican or wholly Democrat \u2013 all 25 electoral college votes \u2013 even though the popular vote is a dead heat. But states should not be seen as essentially red or blue: they are mixtures in various proportions. You can surely think of many other examples of &quot;the dead hand of Plato&quot; \u2013 essentialism. It is scientifically confused and morally pernicious. It needs to be retired. INFINITY     Max Tegmark.    MAX TEGMARKPhysicist, researcher, precision cosmology; scientific director of the Foundational Questions Institute; author of Our Mathematical Universe I was seduced by infinity at an early age. Cantor&apos;s diagonality proof that some infinities are bigger than others mesmerised me, and his infinite hierarchy of infinities blew my mind. The assumption that something truly infinite exists in nature underlies every physics course I&apos;ve ever taught at MIT and indeed all of modern physics. But it&apos;s an untested assumption, which raises the question: is it actually true? There are in fact two separate assumptions: &quot;infinitely big&quot; and &quot;infinitely small&quot;. By infinitely big, I mean the idea that space can have infinite volume, that time can continue for ever, and that there can be infinitely many physical objects. By infinitely small, I mean the continuum: the idea that even a litre of space contains an infinite number of points, that space can be stretched out indefinitely without anything bad happening, and that there are quantities in nature that can vary continuously. The two are closely related because inflation, the most popular explanation of our big bang, can create an infinite volume by stretching continuous space indefinitely.     'We don\u2019t actually need the infinite to accurately describe the formation of galaxies.' Photograph: Scott Camazine/Alamy    The theory of inflation has been spectacularly successful, and is a leading contender for a Nobel prize. It explained how a subatomic speck of matter transformed into a massive big bang, creating a huge, flat and uniform universe with tiny density fluctuations that eventually grew into today&apos;s galaxies and cosmic large-scale structure, all in beautiful agreement with precision measurements from experiments such as the Planck satellite. But by generically predicting that space isn&apos;t just big, but truly infinite, inflation has also brought about the so-called measure problem, which I view as the greatest crisis facing modern physics. Physics is all about predicting the future from the past, but inflation seems to sabotage this: when we try to predict the probability that something particular will happen, inflation always gives the same useless answer: infinity divided by infinity. The problem is that whatever experiment you make, inflation predicts that there will be infinitely many copies of you far away in our infinite space, obtaining each physically possible outcome, and despite years of tooth-grinding in the cosmology community, no consensus has emerged on how to extract sensible answers from these infinities. So strictly speaking, we physicists are no longer able to predict anything at all! This means that today&apos;s best theories similarly need a major shakeup, by retiring an incorrect assumption. Which one? Here&apos;s my prime suspect: infinity. A rubber band can&apos;t be stretched indefinitely, because although it seems smooth and continuous, that&apos;s merely a convenient approximation: it&apos;s really made of atoms, and if you stretch it too much, it snaps. If we similarly retire the idea that space itself is an infinitely stretchy continuum, then a big snap of sorts stops inflation from producing an infinitely big space, and the measure problem goes away. Without the infinitely small, inflation can&apos;t make the infinitely big, so you get rid of both infinities in one fell swoop \u2013 together with many other problems plaguing modern physics, such as infinitely dense black hole singularities and infinities popping up when we try to quantize gravity. In the past, many venerable mathematicians expressed scepticism towards infinity and the continuum. The legendary Carl Friedrich Gauss denied that anything infinite really existed, saying &quot;infinity is merely a way of speaking&quot; and &quot;I protest against the use of infinite magnitude as something completed, which is never permissible in mathematics&quot;. In the past century, however, infinity has become mathematically mainstream, and most physicists and mathematicians have become so enamoured of infinity that they rarely question it. Why? Basically, because infinity is an extremely convenient approximation for which we haven&apos;t discovered convenient alternatives. Consider, for example, the air in front of you. Keeping track of the positions and speeds of octillions of atoms would be hopelessly complicated. But if you ignore the fact that air is made of atoms and instead approximate it as a continuum, a smooth substance that has a density, pressure and velocity at each point, you find that this idealised air obeys a beautifully simple equation that explains almost everything we care about: how to build airplanes, how we hear them with soundwaves, how to make weather forecasts, etc. Yet despite all that convenience, air of course isn&apos;t truly continuous. I think it&apos;s the same way for space, time and all the other building blocks of our physical word. Let&apos;s face it: despite their seductive allure, we have no direct observational evidence for either the infinitely big or the infinitely small. We speak of infinite volumes with infinitely many planets, but our observable universe contains only about 10 to the power of 89 objects (mostly photons). If space is a true continuum, then to describe even something as simple as the distance between two points requires an infinite amount of information, specified by a number with infinitely many decimal places. In practice, we physicists have never managed to measure anything to more than about 17 decimal places. Yet real numbers with their infinitely many decimals have infested almost every nook and cranny of physics, from the strengths of electromagnetic fields to the wave functions of quantum mechanics: we describe even a single bit of quantum information (qubit) using two real numbers involving infinitely many decimals. Not only do we lack evidence for the infinite, but we don&apos;t actually need the infinite to do physics: our best computer simulations, accurately describing everything from the formation of galaxies to tomorrow&apos;s weather to the masses of elementary particles, use only finite computer resources by treating everything as finite. So if we can do without infinity to figure out what happens next, surely nature can too \u2013 in a way that&apos;s more deep and elegant than the hacks we use for our computer simulations. Our challenge as physicists is to discover this elegant way and the infinity-free equations describing it \u2013 the true laws of physics. To start this search in earnest, we need to question infinity. I&apos;m betting that we also need to let go of it.

When Jean Cocteau wrote his solo play in 1928, the chance of overhearing the secrets at the heart of a stranger\u2019s relationship were relatively slight. Today you spend bus journeys trying to close your ears \u2013 or restraining your desire to intervene.

But Toneelgroep Amsterdam\u2019s spare, restrained production is gripping and moving, the audience left helplessly eavesdropping on a conversation that is building to an end point no less devastating for its increasing inevitability. Cocteau\u2019s play unflinchingly explores the horror of love. Response to break-up tends to be trite or embarrassed, but here Halina Reijn lays bare the bereavement of losing a relationship, and the pain of unrequited passion. It\u2019s performed in Dutch with English surtitles, but there is often little need for them: that great ache of despair recognisable in any language. The production here is strong, taking its influences from Hitchcock\u2019s Rear Window. Reijn performs in a minimal box behind a sheet of glass \u2013 we peer in as though idle neighbours in the opposite apartment block, watching a woman in her sloppy trackpants and shrunken Disney jumper pace and plead; despair and eventually give up. The clever sound design only highlights that sense we\u2019re listening in to something we really shouldn\u2019t. Reijn\u2019s performance is controlled and refined as she flits between putting on a brave face and sparing her former lover\u2019s feelings, and explaining how much it hurts; convincing herself she knew what she was getting in to, but increasingly desperate to keep her lover on the line and avoid that final goodbye. It\u2019s not exactly light entertainment, but there are some moments of relief, albeit ones that only make the final moments more unbearable for their normalcy: a quick burst of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s single ladies, a ridiculous conversation about the lover\u2019s dog underscored with pathos. It would have been easy for Reijn to overcook this performance, and ratchet up the hysteria. (The only off moment sees her vomit, which feels somewhat out of step with the approach elsewhere). Instead she takes emotions we all recognise and makes us feel their power deeply; our status as eavesdroppers only adding to our unease. \u2022 Until January 13", "sentences": ["But Toneelgroep Amsterdam\u2019s spare, restrained production is gripping and moving, the audience left helplessly eavesdropping on a conversation that is building to an end point no less devastating for its increasing inevitability."], "title": "La Voix Humaine, Toneelgroep Amsterdam \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/13/la-voix-humaine-toneelgroep-amsterdam-review", "tags": ["Sydney festival 2014", "Theatre"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-01-13T18:33:00Z", "article": "You can barely walk into a museum these days without being confronted by an eerie-eyed raven or a monkey&apos;s shrunken head. From Margate to Nottingham, from Hackney to Bradford, exhibition spaces are filling up with a macabre menagerie of dead things \u2013 from bones and beasts to stuffed birds. Indeed, next week the Milton Keynes Gallery will join the trend, opening a modern &quot;cabinet of curiosities&quot; that will set paintings by Gainsborough, Millais, Warhol and David Bowie next to taxidermied pelicans, medieval maps, and even an Aston Martin DB4, much like the one driven by James Bond in the 1960s. Some might blame this wilfully digressive trend on over-active curatorial imaginations and the legacy of Damien Hirst&apos;s death-obsessed exploitation of natural-history specimens. Others might point to rising star Polly Morgan&apos;s reinvention of taxidermy as a fine art. But such eclectic tastes are in fact nothing new. From the Renaissance to the 18th century, the cabinet of curiosities celebrated the act of collection for its own sake, in an almost haphazard accumulation of natural-history specimens and other bizarre objects. Crocodiles were hung from rafters, skulls (animal and human) vied for shelf space with toads supposedly found alive in rocks \u2013 and then there were the &quot;mermaids&quot;, composed of monkey torsos sewn to fish tails. These items invariably came from far-flung, semi-mythic places: from the ultima thule of the Arctic to the mysterious reaches of the far east; from profound oceans to impenetrable jungles where any kind of monster might lurk. Among the most famous cabinets was the one assembled by the 17th-century Danish physician Ole Worm, which included everything from dangling polar bears to birds of paradise \u2013 but also ethnographic items illustrating the variety of human races. Worm&apos;s intention was as aesthetic as it was instructive, reflecting a catholic, Renaissance sensibility. Only with the advent of strictly demarcated disciplines \u2013 science in one corner, art in another \u2013 would the cabinet come to be outmoded in the 19th century; although it had its last hurrah, perhaps, in the extraordinary Pitt Rivers collection in Oxford. Cabinets of curiosities were a strange bridge between atavistic myth and dawning scientific reality. As such, their revival speaks to our own vexed relationship with the natural world, at a time when we seem bent on destroying it \u2013 partly as a result, some might say, of the schism between science and art. However, few of the contemporary artists attempting to emulate the exotic appeal of the wunderkammer (wonder cabinet) could compete with what is happening in continental Europe, where curators have some of the most famous works of art in the world to play with. The sprawling halls of the Prado in Madrid are usually filled with heaving tour groups being led by the nose from one lustrous masterpiece to another. Today, they have been stopped in their tracks. Standing in front of Rubens&apos;s Rape of Europa is a full-sized, majestic, stuffed bull. The beast&apos;s horns point dangerously towards the painting, ready to impale the turbulent body of Europa as if she were a matador. Yet, surreal as it is, there&apos;s something rather apt about the intrusion of this glassy-eyed animal. The Prado was originally created as a natural-history museum to house specimens brought as tributes to the Spanish royal family from around their empire. It was, in effect, a giant cabinet of curiosities. Which is what it has become again. Three hundred years on, Natural Histories, a monumental exhibition by the Madrid-born contemporary artist Miguel Angel Blanco, echoes that spirit while taking it to another level. &quot;My intention was not to invade the museum,&quot; says Blanco of his project, three years in the making. Rather, he sought to provoke an &quot;alchemical process&quot;. And so, as well as the in-your-face bull, a dolphin skeleton now hangs from the dome of the museum&apos;s sculpture court, casting its looming shadow over\u00a0a massive marble Venus and her dolphin. &quot;It&apos;s jumping like a leviathan,&quot; says Blanco, &quot;as it prepares to swallow the goddess.&quot; Elsewhere, a golden eagle soars through vaulted arches. A portrait of Charles II of Spain, who believed himself bewitched and had himself exorcised, is faced by a mysterious round Aztec mirror carved from pitch-black obsidian, as if to reflect the evil spirits within the possessed emperor. Another installation \u2013 featuring a lusty 17th-century oil of Orpheus charming the animals in the forest, with his kit off for some unaccountable reason \u2013 riffs on the myth of the unicorn. A narwhal tusk, almost three metres long, sits next to the painting. Such tusks, the erupted teeth of Arctic whales, were once touted around Europe as relics of unicorns. They were worth 20 times their weight in gold: the one owned by Elizabeth I could have bought her a new castle. A cabinet of curiosities was part-witches&apos; cave, part-apothecary&apos;s chamber and part-science lab. Thus, one of the Prado set-pieces incorporates Goya&apos;s The Witches&apos; Sabbath: a fabulously gothic depiction of a gathering of witches attended by Satan in the form of a goat. Blanco has responded to\u00a0Goya&apos;s work by assembling a vitrine containing the ingredients for the hideous crones&apos; potions: bat skeleton, preserved snakes and toads, all labelled with their scientific names.     A Prado installation in front of the Ant\u00f3n Meng workshop\u2019s His Majesty\u2019s Anteater. Photograph: Pedro Martinez De Albornoz    The modern trend for the cabinet shows little sign of slowing down. Curiosity and the Art of Knowing \u2013 a brilliant show curated by Brian Dillon that has just left the Castle Museum in Norwich bound for Amsterdam \u2013 has as its star exhibit the overstuffed carcass of a walrus. Aquatopia, a watery-themed show currently at Tate St Ives, mixes priceless Turners and contemporary sea-themed film pieces with carved sperm whale teeth and 19th-century diving helmets. Meanwhile, at Corsham Court in Somerset, artist Angela Cockayne recently restored an original cabinet of\u00a0curiosities she found hidden in the building&apos;s Elizabethan cellars: a dusty trove of bird skulls, shells and butterfly wings. As a result, Cockayne curated the wonderfully allusive Provenance, with works by Mat Collishaw, Gavin Turk and Tessa Farmer. Farmer&apos;s miniature winged humans, attacking wasps under glass domes like something from a microscopic horror movie, are a particularly effective evocation of the spirit of the wunderkammer. Literature, too, has picked up the challenge \u2013 from Amy Leach&apos;s Things That Are, drawing on animals, plants and constellations alike, to Caspar Henderson&apos;s Book of Barely Imagined Beings, a fantastical but scientifically rooted compendium, subtitled A 21st Century Bestiary. The awful contemporary relevance of the theme is inescapable: busily exterminating species as we are, our modern cabinets are being rapidly denuded. The very idea of collection is generally tantamount to appropriation \u2013 in the Prado&apos;s case, fine art paid for by gold and silver stolen from Spain&apos;s Central and South American empire. The side effects of modern capitalism, now plundering the planet like some kleptocratic emperor of old, are even\u00a0more far-reaching: from the 4,000-year-old coral spires destroyed by deep-sea trawling to proposals to\u00a0drill for oil in the Arctic, not to mention suggestions that the newly discovered volcanic vents in oceanic trenches (the last vestiges of virgin territory on Earth, where life itself might have started) are about to be mined for rare metals.. Some estimates put the rate of species loss at\u00a0100,000 a year and rising. In this light, a contemporary cabinet would contain specimens that will have gone extinct within our own lifetimes. Collecting as preservation or predation? Art, as ever, only asks the question. Of all the modern artist-curator-collectors, one stands out for the eccentricity and extremity of his habit. Viktor Wynd is the grandson of the novelist Patrick O&apos;Brian (who himself wrote a biography of perhaps the greatest collector of the 18th century, Sir Joseph Banks). His Little Shop of Horrors in Hackney, London, presents an up-to-date collection of curiosities. Visitors are greeted by more taxidermied beasts, from crows to hyenas; the\u00a0faint-hearted are advised not to proceed downstairs, into Wynd&apos;s dim\u00a0and dungeon-like cellar, which contains two-headed babies and antique pornography. (There&apos;s a long tradition of such shock exhibits \u2013 guests arriving at the home of the celebrated 18th-century anatomist and collector John Hunter were greeted by the preserved erect penis of a hanged man in his hallway.) Wynd is about to publish Viktor Wynd&apos;s Cabinet of Curiosities, a glossy tome celebrating his obsession with collecting. He is currently trekking in the cloud forests of West Papua, hunting for carnivorous plants. &quot;What\u00a0can I say?&quot; he replies to my email asking for details. &quot;My house and\u00a0my\u00a0shop are cabinets of curiosity designed to fill my every waking moment with distraction from the boredom and misery of my life and keep me filled with wonder.&quot; And with\u00a0that, Wynd adjusts his gaiters, and sets off in search of new specimens for his ever-expanding cabinet. Its contents may well be the last of their\u00a0kind. \u2022 Philip Hoare&apos;s The Sea Inside is published by Fourth Estate (philiphoare.co.uk).", "sentences": ["Curiosity and the Art of Knowing \u2013 a brilliant show curated by Brian Dillon that has just left the Castle Museum in Norwich bound for Amsterdam \u2013 has as its star exhibit the overstuffed carcass of a walrus."], "title": "Museum and gallery curators reopen the cabinet of curiosities concept", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jan/13/cabinet-curiosities-taxidermy-retro-museums", "tags": ["Art", "Exhibitions", "Museums", "Zoology", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-01-14T19:10:29Z", "article": "In a few weeks, people will be able to drive across the US for free \u2013 as long as they have the $70,000 plus to buy a Tesla electric car. The Silicon Valley car company started by billionaire Elon Musk announced Tuesday that it is close to finishing a nationwide network of \u201csupercharger stations\u201d that will form a chain from Connecticut down the east coast and on across middle America to Los Angles then up to Vancouver in Canada.

A Model S can travel 300 miles on a full charge. \u201cI receive dozens of emails every day with people asking me for a supercharger here, a supercharger there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are responding to huge demand.\u201d The news came as Tesla was once more hit with technical difficulties. On Tuesday the company issued a recall of about 29,000 charging adapters for its 2013 Model S electric cars because of a potential fire hazard. Guillen dismissed the recall as a \u201cfirmware\u201d update and said nothing would have to be physically recalled. He said that more than 99% of the chargers had already been updated. \u201cWe are going to be having discussions about using a word that has no physical sense,\u201d he said. Tesla\u2019s share price spiked 10% after the press conference, suggesting investors had dismissed the recall. It is one of several fixes that the company has had to make. In November federal officials began probing into two battery fires in Tesla vehicles. Half of the company\u2019s Roadster, its first car, were recalled for chassis issues. Guillen said there were now more than 25,000 Model S vehicles on the road and they had driven 168m miles without a single fatality. \u201cThis is one of the safest cars on the road. And we have the evidence to show it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t stand still. Although the car is, we believe, extremely safe my colleagues are continuing to think about ways of making it even safer.\u201d Guillen said the company was getting closer to launching the Model X, its next generation electric car, and would then work on a cut price, mass market model he said would be half the price of the Model S. The company hopes to sell more than 40,000 vehicles in 2014. Tesla\u2019s Model S is now the best selling car in Norway, which is now fully covered by superchargers and a network that reaches to the arctic circle, said Guillen. He said the company had already built a supercharger network between Amsterdam and the alps and would build a network of charges between Toronto and Montreal \u201cas soon as weather allows\u201d. A number of new electric cars were launched at the Detroit auto show including new cars from BMW and Mercedes\u2019 Smart.

It was obviously an affair that was meant to be hidden from the world, not shouted from the rooftops. We couldn&apos;t believe it; it was like a magical discovery of a secret that had been hidden for about 50 years. We were scratching around for a name at that time and My Darling Patricia seemed to fit. There was something about that discovery that did and has continued to resonate through our work.

Two years ago, I was watching my grandmother die in a nursing home. Her name was Sheila \u2013 she had four kids, living all over the Australia, and they all came back to her to say goodbye. I was at my partner&apos;s house when I got these messages from my mother saying &quot;Granny&apos;s not going to be much longer, you might want to come&quot;. My uncle and cousin had been there but had left the room, and my mother and I were there and holding her hand when she went into a death rattle; she breathed in and out \u2026 and in and out ... then she was breathing more slowly, then she breathed out \u2013 and she didn&apos;t breathe in again. My mother and I knew it was over and burst into tears. And as we were crying, right there in this extreme outpouring of emotion, Granny breathed in again \u2013 false alarm, she wasn&apos;t dead \u2013 and we couldn&apos;t stop laughing. The whole mood changed. My uncle came back into the room and we told him what had happened and why we were laughing and we were talking about her and her life ... and during that conversation, that&apos;s when she slipped away. It had a profound effect on me \u2013 I understood in that hour that the line between bleakness and sadness and humour, life and death \u2013 it&apos;s really imprecise. That&apos;s the thing you find in Beckett \u2013 he understands how closely grief and laughter are placed next to one another. I&apos;ve never been the same since that day. That hour.

I was only 18 \u2013 and at that age I was quite easily led, so to this day I don&apos;t know why I didn&apos;t go along with it \u2013 but I uncharacteristically said no.

I was six years old and I was watching TV on Christmas Eve \u2013 every year there was circus on TV on Christmas Eve in Finland. And I watched a Chinese circus \u2013 four women doing contortions together \u2013 and I just decided that I was going to become a circus artist, then and there. [That was] 1986. They did a trick where you lie on your stomach and you put your legs in front of your face and I started to train myself to do it. I practised and practised on my own, at home, and when I could finally do it, I said to my mother: I have to be circus performer. There was no circus school in my hometown, so my mum took me to rhythmic gymnastics and I trained and competed in it on the national level until I was 16, when I moved to Helsinki and finally found a circus training school and swapped from gymnastics to circus. Since the age of 23, I&apos;ve been doing it professionally; I&apos;m now 33, so that&apos;s 10 years. It was just luck \u2013 of Christmas Eve, the right television channel, the TV being on ... because that day has shaped my whole life. From passion, friends, hobbies, travelling, working ... everything \u2013 good and bad \u2013 in my life, springs from that moment. Lisa Havilah, artistic director,\u00a0Carriageworks I was the first student to do a creative arts law degree at the University of Wollongong. I did the law to make my father happy, I was studying painting. They had big studios at the faculty of creative arts at the time and I had the upstairs studio. Glenn Barkley [now senior curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney] was a year behind me, and he had the downstairs studio. I was vaguely aware of him but we hadn&apos;t really spoken. And then, one day, he just lent me a book. It was by Brice Marden, the American conceptual painter \u2013 I don&apos;t know why he did that. Somehow, the book got lost or stolen \u2013 I felt guilty, so as some kind of a replacement I gave him Robert Hughes&apos; Nothing if Not Critical \u2013 but as I gave it to him, he said &quot;I&apos;ve already got this book.&quot; And that moment passed between us \u2013 I was 20, Glenn was 19, we had a shared history of growing up on the south coast and studying art at Wollongong uni, but in this moment I realised I&apos;d found someone who had the same critical intellectual approach to art that I had, and he saw it in me, too.

Van\u00a0Gogh painted four images of sunflowers in a\u00a0pot,\u00a0and then three copies that depart in many details from the originals. Together, they amount to an iconic body of work,\u00a0representative of his creative powers at\u00a0their height. Yet the first time one was exhibited in his lifetime it caused uproar. Having been invited to show work alongside Les Vingt, an avant-garde group of 20 artists in Brussels, in January 1890, Van Gogh consulted his brother Theo as to what he should send. Theo recommended the sunflowers and explained why. &quot;I&apos;ve put one of the\u00a0sunflowers on the mantelpiece in our\u00a0dining room. It has the effect of a\u00a0piece\u00a0of fabric embroidered with satin and gold, it&apos;s magnificent.&quot; But such richness and beauty, achieved by means of Van Gogh&apos;s stark simplicity and strong colour, was not apparent to\u00a0others. The artist Henry de Groux threatened to remove his own work from the 1890 exhibition if he found it\u00a0in the same room as &quot;the laughable pot\u00a0of sunflowers by Mr Vincent&quot;. As\u00a0Van\u00a0Gogh&apos;s artist friends Toulouse-Lautrec and Paul Signac were present when this was said, the evening ended in chaos, and a fight was only narrowly avoided. The next morning, De Groux resigned. To the critic of Le Journal de Charleroi, it was understandable: this artist had been &quot;very justly exasperated&quot; by Van Gogh&apos;s sunflowers. Today, four of these seven sunflower paintings are in public collections. Two\u00a0of the four originals can be seen in\u00a0London from 25 January, when the\u00a0one belonging to Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam joins the one in the National Gallery. Anyone who tried to\u00a0buy Christmas cards last year at the National will have been forewarned. Almost half the Christmas merchandise, or so it seemed to this disgruntled visitor, was covered with sunflowers \u2013 fridge magnets, drying-up cloths, mugs, table\u00a0mats, coasters, diaries, address books, even spectacle cloths and cases. When Martin Bailey, the Van\u00a0Gogh expert and journalist, estimates that about 5 million people see Van Gogh&apos;s sunflowers every year, he is talking about the oil paintings, not the ubiquitous reproductions they have spawned. These may indeed have damaged the authority and originality of the sunflowers, and removed their &quot;aura&quot; to a mythical region associated with the cult of genius, as Walter Benjamin described in his famous essay &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot;, but many visitors will nevertheless flock to the National Gallery in the next few weeks. The appeal of Van Gogh&apos;s sunflowers seems more pervasive than ever. It will be further enhanced by Bailey&apos;s The Sunflowers Are Mine: The\u00a0Story of\u00a0Van Gogh&apos;s Masterpiece (Frances Lincoln). This is a handsome book, well\u00a0organised and beautifully produced, its\u00a0generous colour illustrations fully supporting the original research. Bailey delivers new insights with an absence of\u00a0fuss. Even those well versed in Van\u00a0Gogh will find surprises in it. Flower painting has a long history, but no other flower, Bailey argues, is so\u00a0strongly associated with a particular artist as the sunflower is with Van Gogh. He painted his first ones soon after arriving in Paris in 1886. The apartment he and Theo shared was in the Rue Lepic, a steep road that leads up to the top of Montmartre. At that time, it had\u00a0three windmills on its summit, allotments on its slopes and, among the\u00a0vegetables, a scattering of flowers. Initially, sunflowers appeared as small details in Van Gogh&apos;s landscapes. Then in 1887, in a series of four oils, he made a close study of them, discovering the Fibonacci spiral in the whirling pattern of their seeds, and using their cut heads as a form of still\u00a0life.     Van Gogh's Sunflowers, 1889. Courtesy of Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam    Flowers had dominated his output during the summer of 1886. Theo reported to their mother that Vincent was receiving a fresh delivery of flowers every week from friends. One of these may have been Ernest Quost, who specialised in flower pictures, lived nearby and had a garden. The work of\u00a0flower painter Adolphe Monticelli, who\u00a0died in that year, remained an inspiration to Van Gogh, as did Edouard Manet&apos;s still life of peonies. Yet his love of flowers had to connect with his interest in progressive ideas about painting. Having previously known little about impressionism, he\u00a0had arrived in Paris in time to see the eighth (and last) impressionist exhibition. He has also met leading artists through Theo, an employee of Boussod, Valadon and Cie, one of the major outlets for modern pictures, at a\u00a0time when Paris was the centre of the art world. In Vincent&apos;s mind, nature and art were companions. &quot;Always continue walking a lot and loving nature,&quot; he told Theo, &quot;for that&apos;s the real way to learn to understand art better and better. Painters understand nature and love it, and teach us to see.&quot; But it was in Arles that the great sunflower period began. And it coincided with his move into a small yellow house on the edge of the square. He got the landlord to repaint it so that the outside walls became the colour of fresh butter and its shutters a rather hideous green. Inside, the red-brick floors were offset by white-washed walls. It was five months before he could move in, but it inspired his great plan. He told Emile Bernard: &quot;I&apos;m thinking of decorating my studio with half a dozen paintings of sunflowers.&quot; What pushed him into action was the imminent arrival of Paul Gauguin. Wanting to impress his friend with new work, he started painting on 20 August 1888. He sustained himself with coffee and alcohol, and within six days had more or less completed four pieces. One of these was destroyed in the second world war and another, in a\u00a0private collection, is not well known to the wider public. The other two are\u00a0those that will hang together for a\u00a0while in London, and they are among the most famous paintings in the world. &quot;Arranging colours in a painting,&quot; Van Gogh wrote to his sister Wil, &quot;to\u00a0make them shimmer and stand out\u00a0through their contrasts, that&apos;s something like arranging jewels or designing costumes.&quot; He had, by this date, been painting for only seven years, since the\u00a0age of 27, prior to which he had tried to teach, preach, sell paintings, then books. But now he\u00a0had fanatical concentration and a\u00a0confident grasp of his medium. He wanted a similar decorative strength to\u00a0that which he admired in Japanese prints, in which everything is related, not in depth, but to the picture surface. And he quite often used a &quot;cloissonist&quot; line that, as in cloisonn\u00e9 enamel or stained glass, is used to separate one colour from another, or to reinforce form and contrast. So pleased was he with his sunflower paintings that\u00a0he hung two in Gauguin&apos;s bedroom, to greet him when, after a delay, he arrived on 23 October 1888. Bailey is an excellent guide, not only\u00a0to Van Gogh&apos;s technique, but to the intense two-month collaboration between the painters that ended in disaster. There were, in Van Gogh&apos;s words, &quot;excessively electric discussions&quot;, from which both men sometimes emerged &quot;with tired minds, like an electric battery after it&apos;s run down&quot;. Their views about art clashed, and so did their personalities.

Courtesy of Kr\u00f6ller-Muller Museum, Otterlo, the Netherlands    However, the final argument, which led to Van Gogh cutting off the lower half of his left ear, may have had an additional cause. Bailey is the first to detect the clues provided by a painted envelope, addressed to Vincent, placed at the fore of the table in his Still Life with Drawing Board, Pipe, Onions and Sealing-Wax (1889). The writing on the envelope imitates Theo&apos;s hand. The postmark shown, with &quot;67&quot; encircled, identifies a post office in Place des Abbesses in Paris, close to Theo&apos;s apartment. Another postmark over the stamps \u2013 &quot;Jour de l&apos;an&quot; (New Year&apos;s Day) \u2013 was that used in France from late December. And, finally, the &quot;R&quot;, an\u00a0abbreviation for recommand\u00e9 (registered), suggests that it would have contained the 100-franc allowance that Theo regularly sent his brother. If received in late December, this would have been shortly before the tragic cutting of his ear, and it would have been shortly after Theo got\u00a0engaged. News of the engagement would have triggered in Vincent fear of\u00a0losing his brother&apos;s emotional and financial support, both of which were vital to his life and work. &quot;He felt everything, poor Vincent,&quot; said P\u00e8re Tanguy from whom Van Gogh had bought his paints. He never suggested that the sunflower had any religious meaning for him, though it is customarily associated with humanity&apos;s love of God, or Christ. But he did link it\u00a0on two occasions to gratitude. He admits in one letter: &quot;My paintings are \u2026 a cry of\u00a0anguish while symbolising gratitude in the rustic sunflower.&quot;", "sentences": ["Two\u00a0of the four originals can be seen in\u00a0London from 25 January, when the\u00a0one belonging to Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam joins the one in the National Gallery.", "Courtesy of Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam    Flowers had dominated his output during the summer of 1886."], "title": "How Van Gogh's Sunflowers came into bloom", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/17/how-van-gogh-sunflowers-bloom", "tags": ["Art and design", "Books", "Van Gogh", "Painting", "Art", "Art and design", "National Gallery", "Exhibitions", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-01-19T00:02:01Z", "article": "Animated dolls are always worrying. From Copp\u00e9lia to Petrouchka, from Jessie in Toy Story to the sexualised replicants in Blade Runner, they are always ambiguous, always at once innocent and precociously knowing. This sense of the uncanny pervades Jakop Ahlbom&apos;s darkly comic performance piece Lebensraum, in which two male inventors (Reinier Schimmel and Yannick Greweldinger) create a lifesize doll (Silke Hundertmark) to keep house for them. Director-choreographer Ahlbom trained in mime at the Theatre School in Amsterdam, after leaving his native Sweden, where he had endured an unhappy childhood. He was bullied at school, his brother and sister were addicted to drugs, and the family lived in a concrete ghetto &quot;where everyone was either drunk or high, quarrelling or watching porn&quot;. His work has a dreamlike quality, with taut internal logic. With their whitened faces, waistcoats, and fatalistic demeanour, the two men in Lebensraum are clearly\u00a0modelled on the silent film actor Buster Keaton, and live lives of surreal, contrived precision. The piece begins with their breakfast, a highly choreographed scene based on a sequence in Keaton&apos;s The Scarecrow. Like every other aspect of the men&apos;s lives it&apos;s a time-and-motion study, with the meal&apos;s ingredients delivered by a Heath Robinson arrangement of strings, pulleys and counterweights. Their living room, which contains a toilet, is a temple to the anal male psyche. Naturally, the pair are constructing an\u00a0artificial woman out of spare parts. Equally naturally, the result takes them by surprise. Although her features are painted and her movements stiff-jointed and ungainly, the men&apos;s would-be slave doll is uncannily alive, and obdurately resistant to her domestic role. Her facial expressions, while remaining fixed and doll-like, mutate with extreme subtlety. When one of the men sits her in a chair before lowering his trousers and underpants for an after-breakfast session on the toilet, her eyes take on a shining, fascinated gleam. As the piece progresses her articulations become increasingly manic, and her servility increasingly ironic and deranged. Schimmel and Greweldinger are excellent as the agitated male duo, helpless as their minutely ordered lives descend to slapstick and finally chaos, but Hundertmark&apos;s performance is a tour de force. As a movement artist she&apos;s extraordinary; as a theatrical presence she&apos;s at once affectless and profoundly suggestive, charged with what Robert Cheatham, author of The Doll Universe, has called &quot;the terrifying joy of matter&quot;. Lebensraum is performed to live music by Leonard Lucieer and Empee Holwerda of the band Alamo Race Track. The relationship between performance and score is intended to echo that which existed between silent films and the piano music played over them. Lucieer and Holwerda wear suits of impressive hideousness, exactly matching the depressing flock wallpaper featured in the set, and play plangent electric guitar songs with dreamily surreal lyrics: &quot;Turn your eyes up brown, like a\u00a0slightly wounded deer, standing in the back yard\u2026&quot; If this sounds just a little too indie-indulgent for words, it isn&apos;t. The direction is surgically precise, and ART&apos;s music is perfectly integrated into the action. Ahlbom&apos;s new work, BUG, is based on a play by the American writer Tracy Letts. Its subjects include conspiracy theory, paranoia and cockroach infestation, and it opens in Haarlem in the Netherlands next month.

Now Brokeback Mountain, the tragic love story of two American cowboys, is looking to again chart new territory. Next week will see the world premiere of the opera version of Brokeback Mountain in Madrid. The production is based on the 1997 short story by Annie Proulx, which also inspired the 2005 Oscar-winning film. After reading Proulx&apos; tale of doomed lovers, composer Charles Wuorinen knew he had the makings of a tragic opera. &quot;In older operas there would be an illegitimate child or difference of social classes,&quot; said Wuorinen. &quot;Same-sex love, especially when it takes place in an environment where it&apos;s absolutely forbidden, is a contemporary version of the same eternal problem.&quot; The Pulitzer-prize winning American composer approached Proulx in 2007 to ask for her blessing to adapt the story for opera. Proulx went one step further, offering to write the libretto. The result is a production that brings to life the Proulx version of the story, with an emphasis on the rugged Wyoming landscape. The cinematography of the Ang Lee-directed film (above), while beautiful, failed to capture the true nature of the landscape, said Wuorinen. &quot;The landscape is meant to be magnificent and impressive, but also very harsh and very dangerous.&quot; The movie was set against the backdrop of the Canadian Rockies. For the opera the crew travelled to Wyoming to film the actual mountains that inspired the story. A video will project images behind the production, allowing the opera to play out in the shadow of the mountains. &quot;That paradoxical freight that the mountain carries,&quot; said Wuorinen, &quot;physically that idea is in the background.&quot; Stage director Ivo van Hove brushed off any comparison with the movie. &quot;This is not an adaptation of a movie on stage,&quot; he said. &quot;The women are much more explored, and the society around them is much more important.&quot; And the opera finishes with an aria by the main character, Ennis. &quot;He sings out his love. It&apos;s a really big moment in the opera.&quot; While the LGBT movement has advanced tremendously since Proulx published Brokeback Mountain in the New Yorker more than 15 years ago, Van Hove hopes the opera continues the tale&apos;s tradition of pushing the boundaries. &quot;I live and work in Amsterdam. Over the last few years more and more gay people have been beaten up in the streets. It&apos;s not only in Russia, it&apos;s not only in India. It&apos;s still happening also in countries that are very open about it.&quot; The production was originally commissioned by Gerard Mortier in 2008 while at the New York City Opera. Two years later, when Mortier took up his new post as the general director of the Teatro Real in Madrid, he brought the project with him. Van Hove worried briefly about the change of locale. &quot;Because of course it&apos;s a very American story. And it&apos;s about cowboys, which is a real American kind of character.&quot; He was relieved when two North American singers, Daniel Okulitch and Tom Randle, were cast in the leading roles. &quot;Because in Europe, when guys start playing cowboys it becomes easily a cliche.

Wigglesworth is a former music director of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and no stranger to the Coliseum, where he has conducted productions including Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk in 2001 and Parsifal in 2011.

After leading English National Opera to arguably its most successful and consistent period of musical achievement in for the last 20 years or so, the company has announced this morning that its music director, Edward Gardner, will leave ENO at the end of the 2014/15 season after eight years in the job. His successor? Another English conductor, Mark Wigglesworth, a conductor who has spent most of his recent career away from Britain, but whose time in charge of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales at the end of the 90s produced some fascinating and occasionally controversial performances.  Wigglesworth has a close relationship with the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic, with whom he has recorded a vividly imaginative and thoughtful cycle of Shostakovich symphonies. In the opera house, his earliest experience was as music director of Opera Factory; his last big job was leading the Monnaie in Brussels for a tenure that lasted just one year, from 2007-8, but his guest appearances everywhere from the New York Met to Glyndebourne, and his more recent productions with ENO, have cemented his place in the operatic firmament. His luminously radiant yet scintillating and dramatic conducting of Wagner&apos;s Parsifal for ENO in 2011, the final revival of Nikolaus Lehnhoff&apos;s marvellous production, made for one of the finest Wagnerian experiences you could imagine in the theatre.  As a young man, Wigglesworth had a reputation as a brilliant but uncompromising character on the podium, when he encountered the difficulty that all younger conductors must face when they try to get orchestras and opera houses to do things their way rather than they way they&apos;re used to. (Growing up in Scotland, I&apos;ll never forget Wigglesworth&apos;s thrilling performance of Messiaen&apos;s Turangalila symphony with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra in 1993 when he wasn&apos;t even 30, and a brilliantly thought-provoking Beethoven 9.) Wigglesworth will have just turned 50 when he takes up the ENO job, and his experience and maturity mean he can now be confident about winning those battles for musical quality he has always fought in his career. But he has a good relationship with the ENO orchestra, and this ought, at last, to be the appointment that makes his career in this country.             Reading on mobile? Watch Mark Wigglesworth conducting the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra here And what of the man he replaces? Gardner&apos;s performances in everything from Beethoven to Britten, from Berlioz to Wagner, from Verdi to Mozart, have made him essential to ENO&apos;s recent artistic successes, and turned him into one of the most sought after younger conductors around, and not just in the opera house but in adventurous symphonic repertoire too (his recordings of Lutoslawski and Szymanowski for Chandos have been revelations). The press release tells us Gardner&apos;s going to concentrate on his new appointment in charge of the Bergen Philharmonic, which he took up properly at the end of last year. Based on nothing more than putting the odd bit of orchestral chronology together, I&apos;m not sure that completely adds up. Bergen will no doubt be a major part of Gardner&apos;s plans for the next few seasons, along with his guest appearances with orchestras such as the Leipzig Gewandhaus and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. But there&apos;s something else on the horizon, at just the time he leaves ENO: Gardner is already principal guest conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, and when Andris Nelsons officially leaves as music director in 2015, there will be a major job to do in Birmingham with an orchestra Gardner loves, at the best hall for orchestral music in true country, with an ensemble known for making the careers of young and young-ish conductors (Gardner turns 40 in 2014): Simon Rattle, Sakari Oramo, Nelsons.  It is the purest personal speculation, but it seems to me that it would rather make sense if Gardner were next on charge in Birmingham. In any case, time for now to relish his remaining appearances at the helm of ENO this season and next, with Britten&apos;s Peter Grimes coming up at the end of January, the world premiere of Julian Anderson&apos;s Thebans in May, and another collaboration with Terry Gilliam with Berlioz&apos;s Benvenuto Cellini in June.", "sentences": ["Bergen will no doubt be a major part of Gardner&apos;s plans for the next few seasons, along with his guest appearances with orchestras such as the Leipzig Gewandhaus and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam."], "title": "At ENO: exit Edward Gardner, enter Mark Wigglesworth", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/jan/23/english-national-opera-edward-gardner-mark-wigglesworth", "tags": ["English National Opera (ENO)", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-01-24T00:25:53Z", "article": "Not one but two actors&apos; nightmares, confessed Sam Mendes, forced to make an announcement before the second part of his new King Lear production at the National Theatre this week.

The two versions of the same subject have gone on public display for three months, reunited in London for the first time since 1947 when they were brought together for a Van Gogh exhibition at what is now Tate Britain. The reuniting is an undeniably special moment. One is owned by the National Gallery and the other by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and both are among the most popular paintings they own. &quot;It has taken 65 years to happen and will probably take another 65 for it to happen again because both paintings are so central to what our museums do,&quot; said the National Gallery&apos;s curator of post-18th century paintings, Christopher Riopelle. &quot;I&apos;m sure there are people in Amsterdam now swearing because they&apos;ve gone to the museum and Sunflowers isn&apos;t there.&quot; Visitors entering Room 46 of the National Gallery will see the London Sunflowers, one of four that Van Gogh made to decorate a bedroom in his &quot;yellow house&quot; in Arles for his visiting friend Paul Gauguin. On its right is one of the three copies that Van Gogh later made. Martin Bailey, author of the recently published The Sunflowers Are Mine, said people would inevitably compare the two to see what changes he made. The differences are both subtle and obvious: the copy is a bit taller for example, because Van Gogh wanted more of a margin at the top. His Vincent signatures are in slightly different places on the pots, to maybe give a better balance, and the colours in the Amsterdam version are more stylised \u2013 botanically incorrect but perhaps more interesting. Bailey said there was no big revelation in having them side by side &quot;but it is more that people will appreciate them in a deeper and more meaningful way&quot;. Senior conservator at the Van Gogh Museum, Ella Hendricks, knows every millimetre of the paintings but even for her seeing them side by side &quot;was also an eye opener&quot;. She said: &quot;It is almost like a spot the difference game and the differences became obvious.&quot; The National Gallery bought its Sunflowers direct from the artist&apos;s family in 1924 and it has become an integral part of its collection. In the gallery&apos;s shop you can purchase nearly 100 different types of sunflowers merchandise \u2013 from a single handmade chocolate square (\u00a31.25) to a coaster (\u00a36), a cushion (\u00a335) and a pearl bangle (\u00a3125). Of the four original sunflower paintings, only three still exist after one was destroyed in an American bombing raid on Japan during the second world war. The remaining originals are the one in the National Gallery, another in Munich and a third that has been squirrelled away in a private collection since 1948, the last time it was seen in public. The three copies are on public display in Amsterdam, Philadelphia and on the 42nd floor of a Tokyo skyscraper. Getting two together is remarkable. Getting more than that would be &quot;everyone&apos;s dream&quot; but unlikely, said Riopelle. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to happen.&quot; Amsterdam&apos;s loan follows a reciprocal one by London last year, marking the reopening of the Van Gogh Museum after renovation. Also on display are the results of recent scientific research by both institutions giving new insights into how he painted his sunflowers and what materials he used. The gallery is anticipating big demand and, because only so many people can be in the room at one time, will operate a queuing system at busy times. The series come from Van Gogh&apos;s most infamous year \u2013 it was 1888 that he had his nervous breakdown, cut off part of his ear and went into an asylum. People have their own reasons for adoring Sunflowers and it often has something to do with the cycle of life feel to them \u2013 there are buds, flowers in full health and dieing ones. Bailey said: &quot;I hope that people will look afresh at something we all think we know. Superficially it is such a simple image but it has enormous power.&quot; \u2022 The Sunflowers are at the National Gallery from 25 January-27 April.

But it is his father as well who is coming under scrutiny, for failing to bring his wild-child son under control and even apparently encouraging his antics over the course of a cross-country rampage that ended in Miami Beach. According to reports, Bieber&apos;s father, Jeremy, 38, partied with his son in the hours leading up to his arrest, even helping to block off streets so his intoxicated son could drag race the rented car. The chaos that characterises Bieber&apos;s lifestyle has all the hallmarks of a crisis set to deepen, warns Manhattan psychoanalyst and author Jamieson Webster. She says Bieber&apos;s erratic behaviour appears to follow a pattern observed in other troubled stars, such as Lindsay Lohan. In this scenario, the attempts by parents to enmesh themselves in their child&apos;s life gives the child no option but to seek ever more extreme behaviour to break the bond. Lohan&apos;s well-publicised problems with drugs and alcohol accelerated after her parents each sought to enjoy her life in the spotlight as if it were their own, she said. &quot;When the parent participates with the child in this way, the result often seems to get close to death because death is, for the child, the only way to separate. Whether the parents are overshadowing, enmeshing or living vicariously through them, it&apos;s always a relationship that&apos;s grown too close. The kids are desperately looking for a way out so they act out in ever more destructive ways.&quot; In the case of Bieber, speculates Webster, the family relationship is primarily between father and son, with his mother, Pattie Mallette, effectively kept at arm&apos;s length. After a string of escalating incidents, Bieber was arrested on Wednesday night for driving, he told police, under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and prescription pills. According to family friends, his mother is seeking advice on getting her son into rehab. &quot;She wants to stage an intervention, but she needs everyone onboard, and this includes Jeremy,&quot; the source told Hollywoodlife.com. But Bieber doesn&apos;t listen to his mother, and clearly neither father nor son are ready to surrender to rehabilitation when, in an echo of rebel heroes like James Dean, the alternative includes drag racing at 3am in a yellow Lamborghini with a ready supply of drugs and alcohol, and a lingerie model for company. According to numerous accounts, Bieber was brought up by his mother, only later getting to know his father who had left to start a family with another woman. He has been characterised as a deadbeat who only resurfaced when his son became famous after being discovered in a YouTube video. Rumours later surfaced that Bieber&apos;s father considered making rap music; others claimed he had addiction problems and was involved with fight clubs and mixed martial arts fighting. Without effective guidance \u2013 Bieber&apos;s manager, Scooter Braun, appears powerless to guide his client toward sobriety \u2013 the most famous child star of the era looks destined to continue on a highly publicised trail of destruction. Bieber&apos;s latest arrest comes just days after Los Angeles police said they found drugs and drug equipment in his California home. In the past year, the singer has scuffled with paparazzi in London, caused controversy after a visit to the Anne Frank museum in Amsterdam and found himself embroiled in a porn star scandal after being secretly filmed asleep in bed in Brazil. In Los Angeles he was filmed urinating in a restaurant mop bucket and concluded a trip to the Hamptons with a club brawl. Yet in a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter he declared: &quot;I know who I am and what I&apos;m doing in my life and what I&apos;ve accomplished and continue to accomplish as a performer, as a writer, as an artist, as a person, as a human being. I&apos;m happy with the man I&apos;m becoming.&quot; To Bieber&apos;s thinking, the media pack in hot pursuit of every new titbit is an adversary. &quot;I don&apos;t give a fuck,&quot; Bieber continued. &quot;Not &apos;I don&apos;t give a fuck&apos; to just be reckless and do whatever, but &apos;I don&apos;t give a fuck&apos; what they say.&quot; When the singer was released on Thursday, he drew attention to a kinship with Michael Jackson by climbing on top of his SUV and flashing a peace sign (Jackson climbed on top of his vehicle to give the same sign when he arrived for his trial on charges of child molestation in 2005). Jeremy Bieber shares the opinion that his son is being hounded. He took to Twitter to broadcast to followers that his son can count on him for support. &quot;I can protect my kids, but I can&apos;t protect them from you and your lies. Believe in the truth not in the lies of the enemy.&quot; Meanwhile, the authorities in Miami are facing criticism for supplying Bieber with an unauthorised police escort when he arrived in Miami and overstating the amount of alcohol he had in his system when he was pulled over. Law enforcement sources initially reported they were &quot;overpowered&quot; by the smell of alcohol when they pulled him over. But police are now saying Bieber&apos;s reading indicated he&apos;d probably drunk less than a single beer. Moreover, it has now been reported that police in Los Angeles now say they did not find biscuit jars filled with marijuana and empty codeine bottles in his house when they executed a search warrant on Tuesday after Bieber was accused of throwing eggs at neighbours (Bieber is said to favour a drink known as &quot;sizzurp&quot;, usually a mixture of Fanta and codeine-laced cough syrup.) &quot;The house was orderly. It didn&apos;t look like a drug pad,&quot; one investigator reported. &quot;I didn&apos;t see any empty codeine bottles. I didn&apos;t smell weed.&quot;", "sentences": ["In the past year, the singer has scuffled with paparazzi in London, caused controversy after a visit to the Anne Frank museum in Amsterdam and found himself embroiled in a porn star scandal after being secretly filmed asleep in bed in Brazil."], "title": "Justin Bieber: the trouble with the wild child \u2013  is it all just a dysfunctional father-son relationship?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/25/justin-bieber-dad-miami-dui-charge", "tags": ["Justin Bieber", "Celebrity", "Miami", "US news", "Life and style", "World news", "Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-01-26T00:05:22Z", "article": "The economy may be adding jobs at a rate of 50,000 a month, according to last week&apos;s figures, but some corners of the country, hit by heavy cuts and closures, are struggling. Thanet, the easternmost tip of Kent, where Ramsgate and Margate jut into the North Sea, has been trying for two years to recover from the blow of US pharmaceutical company Pfizer&apos;s decision to close its sprawling hi-tech research centre near Sandwich, putting 3,000 skilled workers out of a job. The entire local economy, already blighted by some of the UK&apos;s highest youth unemployment rates, felt the effects, and the closure has been blamed for the district&apos;s lurch to the right in last year&apos;s local elections, when Ukip came second to the Tories. Party leader Nigel Farage is considering running for Thanet South, where the party is polling 30%, in next year&apos;s general election. Western parts of Kent, such as Tunbridge Wells and Maidstone, look and feel like satellites of the capital, comfortable in their share of renewed economic growth, expected to have been around 0.7% in the last quarter. But the far east of the county has pockets of deprivation to rival the north of the UK. Ramsgate, Margate and Broadstairs have in recent years seen a sharp decline in seaside visitors, the collapse of the Ramsgate ferry port and the closure of Margate&apos;s Dreamland amusements complex. With Pfizer gone, there is a dearth of big businesses operating in the area. Margate, the much-discussed focus of Mary Portas&apos;s high street regeneration efforts, is still blighted, with one in four shops boarded up. Over the district boundary to the south, Dover has suffered a similar decline, losing a third of its channel ferry business, mostly to tunnel operator Eurotunnel. David Foley, head of Thanet and East Kent chamber of commerce, is optimistic about the region&apos;s prospects but despairs at the overlapping planning responsibilities of Thanet and Kent councils and the conflicts among the many funding bodies pumping money into the region. He angrily tells the tale of the county council and East Kent Opportunities (EKO), a body it funds, taking Thanet district council to court over proposals \u2013 blocked by the council&apos;s planning committee \u2013 for 650 homes on a mixed-use industrial park based around Manston airport. Meanwhile, the Manston Park development has struggled to attract business tenants. Another victim of overlapping planning responsibilities is the Flambeau plastics factory, on the edge of Ramsgate. Managing director John Wingfield has successfully fought off Chinese competition to make buckets and toolboxes for building materials company Jewson, and a range of parts for car assembly plants in the Midlands. Flambeau&apos;s American owners are frustrated that the dilapidated factory does not come up to the required health and safety standards for manufacturing medical equipment. But the truth is that millions of pounds needs to be ploughed into new facilities just to save the existing jobs. (And, as with many capital-intensive businesses, even an expansion of output would create few new jobs.) Spending to stand still is the new reality in an age when all Flambeau&apos;s plastics-making kit can easily be shipped to a new site. An enterprise zone in, say, the Midlands, offering a tax-free existence, could well tempt the business away \u2013 in fact it could move almost anywhere in Europe, which it serves for its US parent. East Kent does have its own enterprise zone, in the shape of the 50-year-old Pfizer site. In 2012 it was taken over by a consortium that has already made a success of an abandoned factory in Teesside, attracting 65 firms that employ 2,000 workers. The Pfizer site, renamed Discovery Park, was promptly awarded tax-free status by the government, along with 12 other sites around the country. Pfizer still has 600 employees working there, in a building it rents from Discovery Park, and another 400 people now work there too, mostly in micro businesses that have taken up residence in the site&apos;s office blocks. Anne Stone, leasing manager, says the target is 3,000 employees by 2017: &quot;We were seen as outsiders at the beginning, and local people were suspicious of our motives, but now they are right behind the project.&quot; But Thanet council leader Clive Hart \u2013 at the head of a minority Labour administration that benefited from Ukip splitting the Tory vote \u2013 says this is hampering his own regeneration efforts. While a fan of Discovery Park, he points out that its enterprise zone status means it can offer five years&apos; tax-free trading, which makes it more attractive than the two business parks in his district. The idea of tax breaks is to create new jobs, he says, not to allow one area to steal from others. Hart is keen to push through the housebuilding and business development plans that are already in the pipeline, and as a member of EKO is part of the consortium fighting the planning department&apos;s rejection of the Manston homes. He supports plans to lease the Ramsgate port to a new operator \u2013 even though \u00a33.5m was lost in unpaid fees when the last one went bust \u2013 and revamping the amusements complex. after a local trust raised \u00a310m from the government&apos;s SeaChange fund, the National Lottery and others to transform it into a heritage-themed amusement park Other projects are mired in planning wrangles or lack funds. Manston airport was famed for its extra-long runway \u2013 badly damaged planes were able to land there having struggled back from the continent during the second world war \u2013 but is now a low-key commercial destination for Kenyan flowers and fresh vegetables, and has a twice-daily KLM slot to Amsterdam. Hopes it would be part of Howard Davies&apos;s plans for a ring of London airports were dashed when the report he published just before Christmas focused on Heathrow and Gatwick. Stagecoach founder Ann Gloag recently bought the site, and its debt, but has yet to make clear her intentions. The airport&apos;s chief executive, Charles Buchanan, believes Gloag is ready to be the next Richard Branson and will develop passenger flights from Manston, but she could just as easily apply to build houses there. Kent&apos;s local authorities are under intense pressure to build homes. An application for a second development of 850 homes, also next to the airport, is going through the planning process. Separately, local papers have reported interest in buying and renting from several London boroughs in need of properties for housing benefit claimants. Green councillor Ian Driver accuses council leader Hart of trying to reinvent the past. He says plans for the airport and commercial port in Ramsgate are doomed to fail, and the emphasis should be on developing local culture and attracting visitors. Improvements to the HS1 high speed rail link from London will help the area win business, he says, but mostly offer Margate and Ramsgate the opportunity to triumph in the way Brighton has. Where the train from London to Margate once took two-and-a-quarter hours, it now takes 90 minutes. With HS1 possibly cutting that time to just over an hour, it&apos;s no wonder the scheme is seen by all as the region&apos;s saviour. Even with the longer train journey, Margate&apos;s Turner Contemporary gallery has succeeded in attracting over a million visitors since it opened in 2011. The gallery&apos;s director, Victoria Pomery, is keen to point out that so far the gallery has generated around \u00a36m a year of additional spending and supported an estimated 130 jobs. At \u00a317m, it is an expensive jobs generator, but Hart at the council and Foley at the chamber of commerce are convinced that it can be the foundation stone for further regeneration. But others remain to be persuaded that copying areas such as north Norfolk and Brighton by favouring cultural businesses is a better bet than spending scarce funds on reviving the sectors that once dominated this part of Kent.", "sentences": ["Manston airport was famed for its extra-long runway \u2013 badly damaged planes were able to land there having struggled back from the continent during the second world war \u2013 but is now a low-key commercial destination for Kenyan flowers and fresh vegetables, and has a twice-daily KLM slot to Amsterdam."], "title": "Conflict and confusion in the towns Pfizer, and the recovery, left behind", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/26/thanet-conflict-confusion-pfizer-recovery", "tags": ["Economic growth (GDP)", "Business", "Economic policy", "Economic recovery", "Manufacturing sector", "Heritage"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-01-28T05:59:00Z", "article": "As any weary traveller should know, there&apos;s no such thing as a free lunch.

The missing link is the fact that the greenhouse supergas methane is chemically identical to natural gas, which is the fossil-fuel industry&apos;s favourite cure-all for climate change. It&apos;s possible that 3.6 billion farting livestock are producing more methane than the fossil-fuel industry is releasing by fracking, oil-well blowouts and pipeline leaks, but I&apos;d like to see the numbers. Also I would like to see the percentages of those bovines being raised for meat and as milkers. Finally, the relevance of 9 billion farting human beings and their rotting compost. In short, this discussion appears to have been launched as a diversionary tactic and I&apos;m curious about where the funding for these &quot;studies&quot; originated. Cutting down on meat-eating is a good idea, but let&apos;s focus on the valid reasons: the health of the consumers and the efficient use of our agricultural resources.Dave SchmalzAmsterdam, The Netherlands Importance of apprenticeships Concerning your article on apprentices in Germany (3 January): I would like to harken back to the years 1957-59 when I was stationed in West Germany with Nato at a place called Iserlohn. I had purchased a Sunbeam Rapier delivered in Dusseldorf so I had to go there for servicing. The car had an elaborate electric gearshift that gave me a lot of trouble. When I would appear at the Rootes dealership I would be received by a master mechanic dressed in an immaculate white coat. He would settle himself down in the depth of the grease pit and summon his two apprentices: a pair of grubby little urchins, who handed him his wrenches etc with the accuracy of an operating room nurse, and if attention was lagging a sharp cuff across the ear would suffice. The other apprentice experience I had was at the barber shop where the two apprentices there: a boy and a girl, would do the preliminary snipping and then the master would climb up on his little stool and complete the fine work. Again, attention was demanded in no uncertain terms. No wonder West Germany recovered as quickly as it did.Gordon WoollardEmo, Ontario, Canada Police must regain trust The outrage resulting from the Mark Duggan trial verdict is entirely understandable and extremely worrying (Duggan family angry at inquest verdict, 17 January). There is a view that the Metropolitan police feels able to consider itself to be above the law and unaccountable to the public that it is paid to serve. We have a disturbing trail of controversial deaths at the hands of the police: some high-profile cases that spring to mind include Blair Peach, Ian Tomlinson and Jean Charles de Menezes. And there are, of course, many others. The Metropolitan police urgently needs to understand the concern that its cavalier actions provoke and to work hard to understand what it has to do to improve its effectiveness and reputation and to gain the trust of the public. Continuing to deny the problems that its actions and attitudes are causing is not the way forward and will surely lead to ever-increasing strife and mistrust in the future.Brian SimsBedford, UK Australia&apos;s refugee problem The harsh and probably unlawful treatment of seaborne refugees by Australia&apos;s Abbott government seems more a laboratory demonstration of rightwing psychopathology than a rational policy (Abbott defiant on asylum-seeker policy, 17 January). The automatic and indefinite detention of all seaborne refugees to Australia in impoverished New Guinea and on Nauru involves both huge expense and international disrepute. An obsession with appearing &quot;tough&quot; in what they claim is the defence of Australia&apos;s sovereignty against foreign, albeit helpless, invaders has an odd corollary in its unprecedented eagerness to surrender a serious piece of that sovereignty to multinationals in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement currently under negotiation. Power, whatever its source or nature, looks to be the Abbott government&apos;s true love.John HaywardWeegena, Tasmania, Australia Two kinds of boredom Gaby Hinsliff didn&apos;t really separate the two distinct types of boredom with which we are affected (17 January). Anyone can sympathise with people who struggle with the monotony of tedious and unchallenging work, but that is entirely different to the kind of boredom that average teenagers complain of when they claim to have nothing to do in the world of immediate gratification online through social media. The skills that have been lost to this generation as a result of the internet age are those of contemplation, and with them, the emotional and sociological advantages to be had by knowing how to be content with having nothing to do. So it is not boredom that has &quot;such a desirable image&quot; according to your columnist, but the healthy mental state of mind that can be induced by use of imagination. Society is losing sight of the simple tenet that to get something of quality, value and emotional depth requires patience, tolerance and effort. You just cannot Google How not to be bored and share it on Facebook. It&apos;s harder than that.Gary LaidlawNorwich, UK Councils and fracking It seems extraordinary that local councils would have a conflict of interest in dealing with the granting of local fracking permits (Fracking in the UK: &quot;We&apos;re going all out for shale&quot;, says Cameron, 17 January). Surely this is an area we would expect local representatives to be extremely cautious about, given the uncertainties surrounding fracking. But local councils are not what they used to be. The seat of power in local government now appears to rest with the operational staff, and not with councillors who are told their council&apos;s financial viability is their first priority. My council has become a quasi-corporation run by a CEO whose job is to ensure, no matter what, that the organisation&apos;s accounts end the year in the black, even if this means boosting income or depleting services at the expense of residents. Gone are the days when local council staff were humble public servants who patiently doffed their caps to residents. Having been constantly harassed as lazy and ineffective in the past, their newfound corporatism finds local officials in a position of power. And this, unfortunately, is a position that does not always coincide with the interests of the\u00a0community.David CatchloveNewport, NSW, Australia Questioning beliefs Thanks to Zoe Williams for her eloquent plea to respect the human rights of atheists (24 January). As an adopted Australian, I was unaware that my inherent right to that belief was protected. As a topic of conversation and potentially antagonistic dispute, my atheism comes second only to my equally strong disbelief in the merits of any known code of football, except perhaps as a necessary outlet for over-energetic teenagers. Both subjects attract a stronger and more aggressive argument from their supporters than from us, the opposing side. Could this be due to the logical indefensibility of an unquestioning belief in both football and religion, which ensures that their more avid proponents huddle together for protection? Infidels of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your anonymity. And possibly the Global Grail.Noel BirdBoreen Point, Queensland, Australia Too little information The article in News in Brief (10 January) regarding women in the UK having the 10th-highest rate in the world for cancers linked to a lack of physical activity raised several red flags. Women have been found to work more hours than men generally due to family and household responsibilities, often in addition to working outside the home, but according to this article they should be squeezing in a few more hours to go to the gym or out for a run! Granted the article was brief, too brief to give significant information such as parameters of data collection, age of population studied, amount of exercise needed for prevention, age when cancer occurred, etc. It is news to me that bowel, breast and womb cancer can be prevented with physical exercise as for some time I have understood that genetic factors, chemical exposure, hormone use, tobacco use etc are more likely to be a causative factor in these cancers. This article leads women diagnosed with cancer to feel that they are responsible for it.Billie LondonSt Augustine, Florida, US Briefly \u2022 In the UK, Belgium is often seen as a dull, backward country; yet in Belgium euthanasia has been legalised for about 10 years (10 January). It is no longer an issue, though many people consider palliative sedation an even better solution. Hugo Claus, Belgium&apos;s Nobel prize candidate for literature, feeling that his mind was beginning to flinch, decided that it was time to quit and in 2008 he asked his doctor to put an end to his life. He was admired for his courageous decision. Some months ago the euthanasia law was even extended to children who suffer from an incurable illness. So who is backward here?Ren\u00e9 WeemaelsBeersel, Belgium \u2022 I couldn&apos;t agree more with Charles Watson (Reply, 17 January).

The Dutch neurologist is, after a 50-year career, a giant in the field. He is a professor of\u00a0neurobiology\u00a0at the University of Amsterdam. His directorship of the Dutch Institute for Brain Research yielded material that has been sent to 500 other research groups in 25 countries. He has propounded groundbreaking theories in his specialist area: the impact on brain development in the womb. Nonetheless, his book, despite directing itself squarely to the layperson, has been miles more successful than he thought, selling 100,000 copies (&quot;the publishers say they knew it would be a hit. But at the start, they only printed 3,000 copies. So I know that is not true.&quot;). There are a number of lines you might file under, &quot;Well, there&apos;s a curiosity&quot; (for instance: &quot;In professional violinists, the part of the cerebral cortex that directs the fingers of the left hand is five times as large as it is in people who don&apos;t play a stringed instrument&quot;). And yet the real fireworks of the book are both more predictable and more profound: Swaab says hormones and chemical substances in utero affect the development of our sexual orientation or, put more simply, you have a gay brain by the time you are born. Male and female brains have &quot;hundreds of differences&quot;, which explain all the ways in which men and women are different; &quot;phobia, impulsiveness, ADHD and depression later in life&quot; can be traced back to a mother&apos;s fearfulness during pregnancy, which activates her baby&apos;s &quot;fear axis&quot;. It has become fashionable to use the word &quot;exhaustive&quot; when what reviewers actually mean is &quot;long&quot;, and this book has been thus described a number of times; in fact, it is not exhaustive. Differences between the sexes are stressed and constantly referred to, but not named or referenced. Very far-reaching statements are made \u2013 for instance, that children who are adopted between nought and two have average IQs of 100, while children adopted between two and six have average IQs of 80. But there&apos;s no footnote. Which children? From where? How many? Adopted by whom? For what reason? Is it possible that the ones who were adopted between two and six weren&apos;t chosen sooner because prospective parents could tell they had a\u00a0learning difficulty? And then there are Swaab&apos;s delightful manners, the smooth, twinkling charm of a man who has spent a life engaged in things that fascinate him, so that even though every answer is basically &quot;sod off \u2026&quot;, it is impossible not to like him. But it is not, ultimately, impossible to unshackle oneself from the confident steam train of his assertions. &quot;I had this problem,&quot; he reminisces. &quot;When I found the first differences between male and female in the brain, I got attacked by the feministic movement. Because it was not allowed to have any differences, not in the brain. All differences in brain and behaviour were due to society.&quot; He says all this as though it&apos;s years since, and yet as a card-carrying feministic, I do not feel that our concerns have been totally addressed. For one, there is a circularity to the argument: a connection that is supposedly hard-wired, say that between a mother and a son, is illustrated by the fact that &quot;a wounded soldier on a battlefield will always call for his mother, not his father&quot;. But this surely is social, because the mother will have almost certainly been the caregiver? We should at least wait until a generation has been raised equally by both parents, then mindlessly slaughter some, and then see who they call for, shouldn&apos;t we? Hypotheses about raised testosterone in the womb due to maternal stress are offered on the basis that girls will need to be more like boys if they&apos;re to be born into a hostile environment, because they&apos;ll need to be more &quot;robust and competitive&quot;. Yet, not long after, there&apos;s a joke about the long-discredited dominant mother theory (about homosexuality), in which Swaab says: &quot;I made a habit over the years of asking the medical students I taught (250 at a time) which of them did not have a dominant mother. No one ever raised their hand.&quot; Sure, it&apos;s droll, but dominance, robustness, competitiveness, these are all the same essential trait \u2013 is he saying that women ultimately become men or is he saying that traits that are quintessentially male are also quintessentially female? If so, doesn&apos;t that de-sex them? Doesn&apos;t that make them &quot;human&quot;? He shrugs this off. &quot;The problem often is that if scientists talk about something, it is on the basis of the population. Some women have very male types of behaviour. Some males have very feminine type of behaviour, but as a population they are different.&quot; This is the &quot;standard-deviation&quot; lecture \u2013 &quot;you won&apos;t understand, because you&apos;re only a layperson.&quot; It didn&apos;t really address my question, which was, aren&apos;t you yourself assigning &quot;maleness&quot; and &quot;femaleness&quot; to traits that we actually all have? Rebecca Jordan-Young, author of Brainstorm: The Flaws in the Science of Sex Differences, argues that &quot;Brain Organisation Theory is little more than an elaboration of longstanding folktales about antagonistic male and female essences&quot;. Other old assumptions about men and women \u2013 for instance, that men are aroused by images of naked women, whereas women can&apos;t be aroused visually in the same way \u2013 are trotted out as fact. But there&apos;s new evidence that women respond very strongly to all kinds of erotic images, including copulating bonobos. This is based on measuring bloodflow to the vagina rather than an MRI scan. It makes this apparently &quot;hard-wired&quot; difference look like male wishful thinking. &quot;Well,&quot; Swaab counters, &quot;it&apos;s measuring bloodflow to the vagina. How did the blood flow to the vagina? By getting a message from the brain.&quot; &quot;Then how do you account for the different results?&quot; &quot;Because the image is too small in the brain, you miss the small nuclei in the hypothalamus. It&apos;s a limitation of the imaging.&quot; (I was too polite to push this point. But that seems like a rum old game, publishing something as true, then recanting it so easily. You either believe that men and women respond differently or you don&apos;t.) As much of a pain in the neck as a feministic can be, Swaab&apos;s most vocal opponents, 20 years ago, were gay men, after he identified a &quot;gay brain&quot;. He makes the sound point, in the book and in person, that this was actually great for homosexuality \u2013 asserting sexual orientation to be innate ended all those painful discussions about whether to blame the parents, whether one could persuade or train or pray oneself out of being gay. &quot;People can only live a happy life if they can live the way their brain has been programmed, and the state should accept that, and guarantee them the freedom to live that way so long as they don&apos;t harm others. You should have the freedom to live as a homosexual, a transsexual, a heterosexual, and be protected by the state,&quot; he says simply. And his discoveries about transsexuality had these direct political consequences; the science put sexuality on the human rights agenda, in Brussels and beyond. There are laws protecting gender reassignment that simply wouldn&apos;t exist without Swaab&apos;s findings. And yet, his conclusions about the gay brain \u2013 specifically, that it has an enlarged biological clock (the suprachiasmatic nucleus) \u2013 have run into dispute. The American neuroscientist Simon LeVay remarked recently: &quot;Dick Swaab&apos;s group wrote in 1990 that a small group called the suprachiasmatic nucleus was larger in gay men than in heterosexual men. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, not sex. Swaab&apos;s report has not been confirmed by other groups. If the finding is correct, it is unclear whether it is meaningful.&quot; I put this to Swaab, that neither LeVay nor anyone else had managed to reproduce his findings. He sort of waved at me, as if I was making an annoying noise. &quot;The important thing is that it&apos;s a marker for something that happened earlier in your brain development. Of course the clock is very much linked to sexual behaviour. There are graphs of students that don&apos;t have anything else to do, but if you look to their sexual behaviour, it goes up at 10, 11, 12. There is a very clear day/night correlation in sexual behaviour. There are more nightclubs than dayclubs.&quot; &quot;This is absolutely true,&quot; I say. Thinking: &quot;Seriously? Results that can&apos;t be replicated, called into question anyway because they were mainly the brains of people who had died of Aids (&apos;We controlled for that! Because many heterosexual people at that time were dying of Aids also. So we were able to see that the enlargement hadn&apos;t affected them&apos;), we&apos;re going to take on trust because of when nightclubs are open?&quot; Other times, his benign dismissiveness can be quite bracing (talking about the Dutch Hunger study, I put it to him that the Leningrad Siege study, also conducted on babies born to women who were starving, in the same time period, in the same sorts of numbers, had findings that were basically opposite. &quot;This is not a good study,&quot; he replies. &quot;If this were a good study, I would have heard of it.&quot; He is endearingly mischievous \u2013 at one point, explaining that anorexia was down to the brain&apos;s way of coping with glucose, which is why anorexics often have problem births; he utterly rejected the idea that it was anything to do with cultural imagery. &quot;Fashion selects girls with anorexia and bulimia, because they look better. But that doesn&apos;t mean that fashion is causing it. It is merely using it.&quot; On the subject of mortality, and of his own brain, he is absolutely wonderful. &quot;Some time ago, I went through a difficult period in terms of health and made some notes for my colleagues, &apos;Mind this&apos;, &apos;Don&apos;t do that&apos;. And then I survived. I wanted to keep an eye on this and that, because I know my own character and I wanted to know the relationships between structure and function.&quot; What characteristics did you want to investigate? &quot;I don&apos;t tell you. You will hear in good time.&quot; The Netherlands already has laws on euthanasia that astonished me \u2013 you can apply to die for long-term mental illnesses, schizophrenia, lifelong depression. But Swaab is keen to see some provision made for people who aren&apos;t ill, who are just old. &quot;They have pains, they don&apos;t want to live any more. It was nice, but not any more. It doesn&apos;t fit into the law in the Netherlands that was made for diseases, not for the end of a life that has been accomplished.&quot; &quot;This is a campaign of yours?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; he says, beaming. &quot;This is my short-term solution, and my long-term solution.&quot; Ultimately, though, I keep returning to Jordan-Young&apos;s critique: &quot;I think we have to start asking different questions. It isn&apos;t possible to do experiments on the causes of gender or sexuality, and we can never really go backwards and separate &apos;biological&apos; from &apos;social&apos; elements \u2013 that is trying to divide what is actually indivisible. So, I think that we might do better to focus on understanding plasticity and ongoing development, and also to stop obsessing so much about sex differences.&quot; Many of Dick Swaab&apos;s boldest statements turn out, on closer examination, to be an MRI scan of chauvinism. It sounds interesting, but you can&apos;t read proper meaning into it; that part of the brain is too small.

As danwilliamson says, it has been &quot;so good to see people extolling the virtues of their cities. Makes a change from the cynicism.&quot; While commenters were not blind to the problems, the virtues of a great many cities were extolled, sometimes in downright poetic terms. So it seems only right to bring you the first (but, one suspects, not the last) Guardian Cities rundown of the best things about the cities you live or work in, starting with this irrepressible description of the Bariga district of Lagos, by Craig Adekunle Adesina:  &quot;I love the oppressively humid air, the desperately ambitious people. I love how you can go from the proud owner of brand new car to an okada (commercial motor bike widely used for transport) passenger overnight ... Lord, I love the Area Boys (street touts). The ones bullying and hustling passers-by (usually in the ghettos) just because they dared walk the public streets of Lagos. Streets they claim belonged to their ancestors and hence the reason why they are collecting money on the long-deceased ancestor&apos;s behalf ... I salute Oluwole market. The forgery head quarters of sub-saharan Africa where everything from any country&apos;s passport to fake currency through to bank statements and any type of utility bills or business documents can be made to order in minutes for a modest fee.&quot;  From Lagos to Lisbon, and oldlisbontown&apos;s take on the capital of Portugal:  &quot;I live in a neighbourhood where all sorts of people live, rich and poor, old and young, native and immigrant, of seemingly all races and creeds (and of no creed at all). I take my child to playgrounds where the norm is for white, black and south and east Asian children to play together on any given day, where soccer and basketball are played, but also cricket. We once had the Inquisition here (in fact, it was headquartered very near to where I live). Such a thing would be unthinkable now, in a city whose mayor of Goan descent was re-elected by a landslide after running a campaign that included billboards featuring immigrants of varied provenances and ethnic backgrounds, celebrating their contribution to the city (where else in Europe would this be possible?).&quot;  All kinds of schemes can make the difference to life in a city. mikedow points to the joy of having &quot;little to no billboards in Vancouver. There are banners on the lamp standards instead. Each high street has its own design, which gets changed regularly, and special events are announced that way also.&quot; There again, roundthings happily announces:  &quot;There&apos;s no particular &apos;initiative&apos; in Bonn \u2026 it seems to me that Bonn is a more pleasant place to live exactly where the changes are most remote.&quot;  The joy of a city can be encapsulated in a single moment. For the aforementioned danwilliamson, it&apos;s when &quot;the sun hits the stone of York Minster (the largest gothic cathedral north of the alps) and the city walls it looks quite magical.&quot; For tomkun, however, it&apos;s six different moments that sum up the delights of Kyoto:  1) Cherry blossom parties in the spring2) Gion festival and fireworks in the summer3) Hiking thru the changing leaves in the Autumn4) Cycling along the Kamogawa river5) Visiting and revisiting famous old temples6) Cycling home thru Gion at dusk and seeing geisha and maiko shuffling off to work.  Not that the rose-tinted spectacles are always on. pylonsider points out:  &quot;Bristol has had a funky, vibrant image for many years. Indeed, for the intensely middle class Inner North West segment and the increasingly aspirational segment just south of the river this is an accurate reflection. But, for the near million within the travel to work region, Bris is a nigh on unworkable city ... And yet, and yet. By and large Bristolians get on with it. There is an unheard underclass who scorn politicians, laugh out loud at the local paper, frighten the middle class with their potentially threatening swagger, and continue to support two of the fallen giants of fubble, City and Rovers. When the sun shines, and it does sometimes, Bristol is a delight.&quot;  Others English cities on the list include Plymouth (&quot;I&apos;m not joking,&quot; says defragmentation, humbly. &quot;It&apos;s a real marmite city, but if you persevere you are rewarded with views that the country&apos;s only real ocean city can give&quot;); Manchester (&quot;there&apos;s just too much to say about the city I call home,&quot; laments munichguy21); and even little old London, with &quot;the magic ingredient of what makes London great.

Often, those questions are the same ones, too. How does 3D printing even work? What&apos;s all this about 3D-printed guns? Can you 3D-print a 3D printer? Why are they so expensive? What can you actually make with them? Apart from guns... The ethical and legal questions around 3D printing and firearms are important and complex, but they also tend to hoover up a lot of the mainstream media attention for this area of technology. But it&apos;s the &quot;what can you actually make with them&quot; question that&apos;s been pulling me in recently. There&apos;s a growing community \u2013 from individual makers to nascent businesses \u2013 exploring the potential of 3D printing. This feature is just a snapshot of some of the products and projects that caught my attention, rather than a definitive roundup. A taste of what&apos;s happening, but one that&apos;s ripe for your comments pointing out better examples in these categories, and other areas that have been left out. All contributions are welcome, but here are 30 things to start the discussion off. 1. RAF Tornado fighter jet parts Early this year, BAE Systems said that British fighter jets had flown with the first time with components made using 3D printing technology. Its engineers are making parts for four squadrons of Tornado GR4 aircraft, with the aim of saving \u00a31.2m of maintenance and service costs over the next four years. &quot;You are suddenly not fixed in terms of where you have to manufacture these things,&quot; said BAE&apos;s Mike Murray. &quot;You can manufacture the products at whatever base you want, providing you can get a machine there.&quot; 2. Arms for children Time&apos;s article from earlier this month on the work of Not Impossible Labs makes for powerful reading: a project using 3D printers to make low-cost prosthetic limbs for amputees, including Sudanese bomb-blast victim Daniel Omar. But this is just one of the stories emerging: see also 3Ders&apos; piece on a four-year old called Hannah, with a condition called arthrogryposis that limits her ability to lift her arms unaided, but who now has a Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton (WREX for short) to help, made using 3D printing.     A prosthetic arm made for a 16 year-old bomb victim in Sudan. Photograph: Not Impossible    3. Old Trafford and the Etihad Stadium Manchester-based company Hobs&apos; business is based around working with architects, engineers and other creatives to use 3D printing as part of their work, but to show off its capabilities, the company 3D printed models of the city&apos;s two football stadia \u2013 Old Trafford and the Etihad Stadium \u2013 giving them away in a competition for Manchester Evening News readers. The models were estimated to be worth \u00a31,000 each. 4. Unborn babies Not actually as creepy as it sounds. This is more an extension of the 4D ultrasound images of babies in the womb that have become more popular in recent years. The theory: why not print them out? One company doing it, 3D Babies, didn&apos;t have much luck with a crowdfunding campaign last year, raising $1,225 of its $15,000 goal. Even so, its website is up and running, offering eight-inch &quot;custom lifesize baby&quot; models for $800 a pop. 5. Super Bowl shoe cleats Expect to see a number of big brands launching 3D printing projects this year \u2013 part R&amp;D and part PR campaigns. Nike is one example: it&apos;s showing off a training shoe called the Vapor Carbon Elite Cleat for this year&apos;s Super Bowl, with a 3D-printed nylon base and cleats \u2013 the latter based on the existing Vapor Laser Talon, which was unveiled a year ago. 6. Honda concept cars Admittedly, not an actual concept car that you can drive. Not yet. But Honda has made five 3D-printable models available from its website for fans to download and make, including 1994&apos;s FSR Concept and 2003&apos;s Kiwami. So it&apos;s more about shining a light on the company&apos;s archives and being seen to be innovative \u2013 although the potential of 3D printing for internal prototyping at all kinds of manufacturers (cars included) is one of the most interesting areas for 3D printing.     Print your own Honda concept car. Just don't expect to drive it. Photograph: Honda    7. Lost statues in Afghanistan Industry site 3D Printer tells the tale of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, two of the largest standing Buddha statues in the world, which were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001 after five centuries watching over the surrounding landscape. A team of experts is now trying to put them back together, with 3D printing used to make 1/25 scale models as part of the planning process. 8. Wheelchair ramps Raul Krauthausen is the man behind Wheelmap, a crowdsourced map of wheelchair-friendly places around the world. In December last year, though, he published the details of his experiments with a MakerBot 3D printer to create his own mini wheelchair ramp. &quot;Of course, there is still room for improvement. For example, I cannot reach the ramps in the back pocket and set them down by myself. But that was not really the idea. I find asking for help acceptable,&quot; he wrote. 9. Skin&apos;n&apos;bones 3D printing tissue could be an article in itself, and I&apos;d welcome your suggestions of innovation happening in this specialised area. The piece that caught my attention was on KVUE about the work of a research team at the University of Texas in El Paso to print skin and other tissue. &quot;Something maybe out of a science fiction book, but now it\u2019s a reality,&quot; as one member of the team put it. But from the BioPen that &apos;draws&apos; cells onto patients through to 3D bio printers that could one day be producing organs, this is an area of intense activity in 2014. 10. Selfies Yeah, selfies. As if flooding Instagram with shots of yourself wasn&apos;t enough, 3D printing is being used by a number of companies to produce essentially action figures of the people printing them out, rather than the standard superheroes, cartoon brands and so on. Cubify&apos;s 3DMe got plenty of attention at the CES show earlier this month for its 3D-printed figurines, but from bobble heads to putting yourself on your own wedding cake, there&apos;s seemingly no end to this 3D-printing subcategory.     Cubify's 3DMe turns people into action figures. Photograph: Cubify    11. Book slipcases MakerBot brought us the story of Chang-rae Lee&apos;s latest novel On Such a Full Sea, which has a limited-edition version with a 3D-printed slipcase designed by her publisher&apos;s art director Helen Yentus. She said that the idea was to give people &quot;the opportunity to have something to hold onto that is not available in digital form&quot;, with Lee adding that &quot;it revisits the book as an object... the pleasure I get from reading is something tactile&quot;. 12. Houses 3D-printed houses aren&apos;t such a big leap, conceptually, from some of the developments in construction and pre-fabricated homes over recent decades. Even so, some of the projects out there in the wild are fascinating. A team from the University of Southern California is working on a machine that is &quot;basically scaling up 3D printing to the scale of building&quot; by squirting out concrete in layers, while in Amsterdam, a 20-foot 3D printer called KamerMaker is printing a house as an artwork. 13. Duck legs and horse shoes It&apos;s not just humans who are getting a 3D-printed helping hand (or arm, or leg...) \u2013 animals are also on the agenda. Witness TechCrunch&apos;s Designers Delay Duck&apos;s Death With 3D-Printed Limb story, about a duck called Dudley who lost his leg in an &quot;aggressive chicken fight&quot; and now has a 3D-printed replacement. Or look at a horse named Holly&apos;s 3D-printed titanium shoes, built by CSIRO to help her recover from a painful disease called Laminitis. 14. Toys from children&apos;s apps Children making their own toys (or, more accurately, customising them) via 3D printing is a growing area of experimentation. British startup MakieLabs was early into the trend: its Makies Doll Factory iPad app helps kids create a doll, which their parents can then order. But then there are apps like Blokify \u2013 essentially the creative sandbox part of Minecraft with the option to 3D-print the things children build at home, or order them from partners. On the way is Monstermatic, a mobile game where children create monsters, and can then print them. All this is expensive right now, but it&apos;s early days.     Makies Doll Factory: an app for making dolls. Photograph: MakieLab    15. Crime scenes Vice&apos;s headline tells the story neatly: 3D-Printed Crime Scenes Are Coming to a Courtroom Near You. Although in truth, unless you live in New Mexico, they may not be that near you for a while. A police station in Roswell has apparently bought a 3D scanner in order to create graphical representations of crime scenes to complement standard photography. 16. Music boxes A startup called Left Field Labs has shown off customisable music boxes, with the twist being that you can print out the music on your own 3D printer, and order the box to play it on. What&apos;s more, you compose the tune using a simple grid-based system online. For now, the company isn&apos;t taking new orders for prints, but it&apos;s letting people save their creations for when it reopens them. 17. Windpipes Another biological application that&apos;s in its early days: a doctor in New York whose team is working on 3D silicone tracheas which take 15 minutes to 3D-print. It&apos;s some way off actually being used for patients, mind. &quot;We have made a 3D airway. The next step is then to incorporate or embed stem cells within that that will differentiate into cartilage, which is the bulk of what the trachea is made up of...&quot; 18. Hubble Space Telescope images There are some beautiful images coming back from the Hubble Space Telescope, but blind people can&apos;t see them. Or can they? NASA reported this month on the project of two astronomers at the Space Telecope Science Institute who are turning Hubble images into 3D-printed pictures with stars, filaments, gas and dust. &quot;I want to represent that in 3-D and have people feel it with their fingers because they can&apos;t see it. They would be able to spatially understand where important features are relative to everything else and what the structure is,&quot; they explained.     Hubble Space Telescope images turned into 3D-printed scenes. Photograph: NASA and ESA    19. Jewellery In the run-up to Valentine&apos;s Day, expect to read a blizzard of stories about 3D-printed rings, necklaces and other jewellery. From American Pearl&apos;s wedding rings (&quot;thousands of possibilities, billions of permutations: every piece is like a snowflake&quot;) to MIT-born startup Matter.io&apos;s design-your-own-bling service to the work of individual designers like Maria Jennifer Carew there is plenty happening on this front. 20. Soil Now back down to earth: as in actual earth. A team at Abertay University is working on creating 3D-printed models of the structure of soil, in order to understand their pores and &quot;the ways in which the fungi and bacteria living within them interact&quot; in Phys.org&apos;s words. &quot;By inserting microorganisms (such as fungi and bacteria) into the pore spaces within the plastic soil, the scientists can now observe how these microorganisms move through it, survive, find food sources and interact.&quot; 21. Inflatable flowers Something else for Valentine&apos;s Day perhaps: 3D-printed inflatable flowers. Designed by Richard Clarkson, they&apos;re part of an experiment to produce the world&apos;s first inflatable 3D print. &quot;Forcing air into the cavities of the print causes it to \u2018bloom\u2019 and thereby reveal the complexity of its physical structure,&quot; explains his website. So, not a product as such, but a glimpse at &quot;an opportunity to generate complex forms and dynamic structures that are impossible to make by any other means&quot;. 22. Iceberg holiday resorts The idea of holidaying on an iceberg may not appeal \u2013 no Titanic jokes, please \u2013 but two students at the Pratt Institute School of Architecture used 3D printing to flesh out their idea for floating iceberg resorts, complete with internal hot springs. &quot;The way Andrew and I were able to be more confident in pursuing this project was having a way to build it,&quot; said one of the pair. &quot;I can\u2019t see myself not having a 3D printer in the future; I think it\u2019s just going to be part of what I do for the rest of my life,&quot; said the other.     Fancy a holiday on an iceberg resort? Photograph: MakerBot    23. Chocolate and other foods 3D-printed food is regularly in the news, with one of the hits of this year&apos;s CES show being the ChefJet 3D printer, which uses sugar and cocoa butter rather than plastics to create various sweet treats. The company behind it, 3D Systems, is also working with confectionery brand Hershey&apos;s for some experiments. But as this handy wrap-up by Business Week makes clear, pizza, ravioli and chickpea nuggets are also on the 3D printing menu. 24. Menurkeys The story of 10 year-old Asher Weintraub was heartwarming last year: he created something called a Menurkey \u2013 a cross between the menorah candleabra and a turkey \u2013 which raised nearly $50k on Kickstarter to become a product. The initial prototyping was done with a 3D printer at MakerBot&apos;s headquarters, although the company noted that Asher was keen to get himself a model to work on future products. 25. Insoles As things to fling $1.75m of funding at, a startup expected &quot;to make 3D-printed shoe insoles both sexy and mainstream&quot; sounds like quite a gamble. Still, that&apos;s the intention of SOLS, which announced its seed funding this week. Its customised 3D-printed insoles are aimed at making a range of shoes more comfortable. &quot;It\u2019s 2014. The idea that we buy the shoes that don\u2019t fit is ridiculous...&quot; 26. Monkey handbags This comes from a Belgian company called Kipling, which is launching a 3D-printed handbag called The Monkey Madness City Jungle Shopper. Inspired by The Jungle Book, all bar the logo and handle are 3D-printed, with the video below providing a taster.         Put enough 3D-printed monkeys in a room, and they'll make a handbag.    27. Bikinis Yes, alright, an easy headline: turning any new technology into lingerie tends to get plenty of attention. Such was the case with the N12 from Continuum, made out of Nylon 12 with its parts &quot;made directly by 3D printing and snap together without any sewing... For a bikini, the nylon is beautifully functional because it is waterproof and remarkably comfortable when wet.&quot; It&apos;s part of a wider range of fashion from the company, including a line of 3D-printed shoes. 28. Guitars Designer Olaf Diegel isn&apos;t just making 3D-printed guitars: he promises to collaborate with the buyers to tailor the instruments to their musical and/or visual needs. His Spider design is particularly fun, coming from &quot;the interpretation of the ultimate heavy metal instrument through the lens of arachnids&quot;. Diegel will even 3D-print musician or band names on the back of an instrument. 29. Vinyl records More music: Bloc Party&apos;s Kele Okereke was part of a project last December to release a new song as a 3D-printed record, sold from a pop-up shop in London as part of a charitable fundraising campaign. The actual record was made using a technique developed by American researcher Amanda Ghassaei for converting digital music files into 3D-printable records with wider, deeper grooves than traditional vinyl. 30. Sad Keanu Even memes are getting 3D-printed in 2014. The collection of sullen Keanu Reeves models is the work of Japanese company idk: &quot;a remarkable instance of 3D mini ennui moving to the mass market,&quot; as 3Ders put it. Counting down to a 3D-printed Grumpy Cat in 3... 2... 1...     Cheer up Keanu, you've been 3D-printed...

But is there anything to be gained by such impatience? Well, yes, in certain cases there is. Some crops take a long time to mature, so starting them off early \u2013 as long as you can provide the right growing environment \u2013 is a definite bonus. Others are robust and fuss-free, so sowing now might gain you an extra-early crop when fresh pickings are otherwise scarce. Here are my top five veg that revel in being quick off the starting blocks: Onions I&apos;m not saying that it&apos;s easy to grow onions from seed \u2013 in fact it&apos;s much simpler to plant sets (tiny bulbs) in spring or autumn. But, by sowing exhibition onion varieties now you put yourself in with a chance of growing super-sized bulbs (check out mammothonion.co.uk for suitable varieties and growing info; you can also sow exhibition leeks now in a very similar way). The most important thing to remember is that any check in growth caused by cool temperatures is likely to result in failure, because this makes the plants bolt (flower) rather than bulb up, so don&apos;t try sowing outside now \u2013 use a heated propagator instead. Plants will need a snug greenhouse/conservatory till mid May, at which point they can be planted in a weed-free spot outside. Feed bulbs up with a high-nitrogen feed and who knows, you could end up nurturing a ten-pounder come the autumn. Microleaves If you&apos;ve just got to have some fresh greens now, these tiny crops are your quickest route to satisfaction. In as little as a week, you can be munching on pea shoots (which taste just like fresh peas), radish greens, rocket, watercress, celery, nasturtiums \u2013 in fact, an infinite number of tangy little leaves. All you need is a seed tray, a little seed compost or damp kitchen roll, a windowsill, and a lid (clear plastic takeaway trays will do just fine). Scatter the seeds quite thickly, pop on the lid, place in a bright, warm spot, water if too dry, and then just chop off and eat. This is a great way to use up surplus or old seed, but if you want a no-fuss bespoke kit then Suttons has just launched a new range.  Broad beans If you&apos;ve tried buying podded broad beans in the shops (frozen broad beans are a little better), you&apos;ll know they&apos;re not a patch on home-grown ones. This is one crop that actually revels in a cooler soil: they&apos;ll emerge when the ground is just 2-3C, but try sowing them in too much summer heat and they&apos;ll fail. If you&apos;ve got a free-draining soil in a sheltered site, risk sowing them outside now. If not (beans hate waterlogging) sow the large seeds 2cm deep, one per 5cm module or pot, and pop in a cold greenhouse or under a cloche or cold frame to harden off later. You can make a second, direct sowing in late February or March, to give a succession of fresh beans over spring and early summer. &apos;De Monica&apos; (Thompson &amp; Morgan) is said to give the quickest harvests from a spring sowing. Don&apos;t forget that you can eat the shoot tips as a spinach alternative (pinching these out as soon as blackfly appears is said to deter this pest). Mange-tout broad beans, such as &apos;Stereo&apos; (Marshalls) are also worth a punt. Chillies     Like your chillies super-hot? Now's the time to sow. Photograph: Rawdon Wyatt /Alamy    Phenomenally popular, highly productive, easy to grow from seed and with astonishing good looks, you&apos;d be mad not to grow the odd chilli pepper every year (a collection of half a dozen plants in pots is even better). Mild types like &apos;Hungarian Hot Wax&apos;, and vigorous growers such as F1 hybrids (&apos;Apache&apos; is my favourite) can be sown in mid-March. However, if you prefer scorching habaneros, nagas and such like, then you should sow them in a heated propagator (set at about 24C) pronto. They can take up to a month to germinate, and are very slow to mature (especially in dull summers), so need all the help they can get. There is a flip side to this \u2013 the hotter species are generally easier to overwinter than milder ones, and such plants have a head start on the same varieties raised from seed. The fab folk at Sea Spring Seeds have put together some handy notes on the topic.  Baby carrots Pulling finger-sized carrots from a container under glass before those in open ground are even through the soil is utter indulgence. Use forcing types like &apos;Early Nantes&apos; or &apos;Amsterdam Forcing&apos;, sowing them into deep containers now. We use 30cm deep plastic crates lined with polythene (the plastic pots rose plants are sold in are also ideal). Fill the base with multipurpose or growing bag compost, and the upper 5cm with seed compost. Water well, allow to drain and then sow your carrot seed thinly on top. Cover with vermiculite and keep at 10-12C (a gently heated greenhouse or well-lit conservatory is ideal). You&apos;ll be pulling roots in May. And as a bonus, they&apos;ll be rootfly-free \u2013 surely reason it itself to give this a go?

The key statistic is no less chilling for being much quoted: heavy goods vehicles comprise about 5% of vehicle traffic in the British capital, but in recent years have been involved in just over 50% of all cyclist deaths. As such the decision by London&apos;s mayor and the city&apos;s 33 boroughs to ban from within the M25 all lorries over 3.5 tonnes that are not fitted with side guards and special mirrors is to be welcomed. The one caveat is whether this goes far enough. Lorries are perilous to those on two wheels \u2013 and, often, those on two feet \u2013 for a series of interconnected reasons. A cyclist struck or clipped by a car will usually be deflected away, and in London the generally low traffic speeds mean such interactions are rarely fatal. In contrast, the high wheelbase of many lorries, especially construction lorries, means riders can easily be pushed under the wheels, suffering terribly crushing and often fatal injuries. This is particularly common in London when lorries turn left across the path of cyclists, an event that can happen both if a cyclist rides down the nearside of a slow-moving or stationary truck \u2013 a manoeuvre they are regularly warned against \u2013 or if a truck overtakes a cyclist before turning. The problem can be exacerbated by the fact that London&apos;s patchy cycling infrastructure tends to funnel cyclists into kerb-hugging lanes on the left-hand side of roads. Side guards and better mirrors undoubtedly help prevent such collisions, with one study reportedly showing they could prevent more than half of all cyclist deaths. Until now, construction trucks in London have been exempt from having to fit side guards, which push a cyclist away from the vehicle if it turns across them, rather than letting them fall between the front and rear wheels. The exemption has been on the basis that the lorries need high ground clearance to negotiate bumpy construction sites. However, the mayor, Boris Johnson, and Transport for London (TfL) have grown increasingly worried about the cyclist toll from construction lorries, commissioning a report last year which warned that &quot;pay per load&quot; contracts can make drivers of tipper lorries reckless and the industry did not treat the issue with enough seriousness. Johnson had already announced a planned \u00a3200 daily fine for lorries not fitted with safety gear, but this has now been ungraded to a full ban. There is, however, a more fundamental problem with lorries in cities. The current common design, sitting the driver in a cab perched high above the engine, makes it very difficult for them to see cyclists close by, however good the mirrors. The Metropolitan police occasionally run sessions in which cyclists can sit in the cab of a construction lorry to gauge the driver&apos;s view. A common reaction is: how can vehicles with such huge and insurmountable blind spots even be permitted to drive on congested city streets? One mooted solution is a new type of lorry design with a lower cab and floor-to-ceiling windows, much as with modern rubbish trucks, where drivers need to keep an eye out for workers operating close to the vehicle. Only on Wednesday Johnson was in Brussels to join the mayors of Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Madrid in arguing for EU-wide rules to ensure lorries are designed more safely, a view which seemingly puts him on a collision course with David Cameron&apos;s government, which is sceptical on the issue. There is, of course, another solution: Dutch- or Danish-style bike infrastructure, where cyclists are largely segregated from motorised traffic and so don&apos;t have to battle for space with lorries. Again, on this, Johnson is trying to push for change, though it is an even longer term battle.", "sentences": ["Only on Wednesday Johnson was in Brussels to join the mayors of Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Madrid in arguing for EU-wide rules to ensure lorries are designed more safely, a view which seemingly puts him on a collision course with David Cameron&apos;s government, which is sceptical on the issue."], "title": "'Unsafe' lorry ban for London cyclists is a good first step", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/30/unsafe-lorry-ban-cyclists-london-m25", "tags": ["TfL", "London", "UK news", "Road transport", "World news", "Cycling", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-02-02T00:05:00Z", "article": "The collection of the Olympic Museum in Lausanne is reputed to include some 10,000 items. Sportswear being what it is, however, some pieces do tend to stick in the mind more than others. Wandering its refurbished circular galleries on a freezing cold morning last week (the museum, founded in 1993, has recently reopened following a two-year-long renovation by the British design consultancy Mather &amp; Co), I could barely take in the amazing amount of Lycra on display; and once you&apos;ve seen one pair of Adidas trainers, you&apos;ve probably seen them all. But then I found myself standing in front of a two-man bobsleigh used by the Swiss team in the 1920s. Made almost entirely of wood, it looked for all the world like the sledge I had as a child; only a Swiss flag painted on its flimsy nose marked it out as kit for competition. Nearby stood a luge from the 1960s, another terrifyingly primitive affair consisting of a simple wooden frame, a webbed seat and a set of reins for steering (they looked to me just like a toddler&apos;s walking reins). Crikey. At last, my heart began to beat just a little faster. The museum is in Ouchy, a quietly chic suburb of Lausanne on the shores of Lake Geneva. An undistinguished sugar cube of a building \u2013 it was designed by the Mexican architect Pedro Ram\u00edrez V\u00e1zquez \u2013 it&apos;s set above a sculpture garden in which you will find sporty works of art by, among others, Gabor Mihaly (Cyclistes) and Niki de Saint Phalle (Les footballeurs). Let&apos;s be honest, though: it isn&apos;t for great hunks of bronze and resin that anyone comes to this place. Of much more interest to most visitors will be the 100m running track just to the left of the museum&apos;s entrance on which it is possible, by means of a clever laser, to compare your own speed to that of the record-breaking Usain Bolt. (How did I do? Oh, you know, I wasn&apos;t wearing the right shoes\u2026 ) But be warned: this rust-red strip of bouncy rubber is also a sign of what&apos;s to come. The refurbished Olympic Museum is interactive to a quite wearying degree. Want to test your hand-eye co-ordination? Want to stand on an Olympic medal podium? Want to check your diet against that of a world-class athlete? Then you are in the right place.     A full set of Olympic torches. Photograph: Arnaud Meylan    There are three main galleries over three floors. The first deals with the history of the Games, the second with sport, and the third with &quot;spirit&quot;, by which they mean that it&apos;s the taking part that counts (also, the fact that athletes really should not cheat). In gallery one, we kick off with a little light ancient history. Did the competition that was held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia have its origins in funeral games organised in honour of warriors killed in combat? The museum isn&apos;t saying, though it has obviously spent quite a lot of money on films that aim to reconstruct the sanctuary brick-by-brick. In this section, for obvious reasons, its main interest is Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the French educator who founded the modern Olympics in 1896. I was interested in Coubertin, a mustachioed fellow who tried and failed to popularise equestrian fencing, but was immediately frustrated by the museum&apos;s often wildly sketchy labelling. In pride of place was a copy of Tom Brown&apos;s School Days, Thomas Hughes&apos;s 1857 novel of public school life, with which, I gathered, Coubertin apparently had some kind of connection. Nowhere, though, could I find its influence on him or on his beloved games fully explained. Moving on, we see the very first Olympic flag, made by the department store Le Bon March\u00e9 in 1913, and a full set of Olympic torches. Touch a screen in front of any of these, and you can call up both the name of its designer and the details of its journey from Greece to host country. (Ralph Lavers&apos;s stainless steel torch for the austerity Olympics in London in 1948 is a beautifully functional thing, while Philippe Starck&apos;s horn-shaped affair for the Winter Olympics in Albertville in 1992 resembles nothing so much as a particularly ugly shower fitting.) A display that aims to show the historical and political context of each games works in similar fashion. Touch the screen, choose a year, and you will find yourself in a &quot;surround sound&quot; bubble, a voice dolefully giving you all the news headlines. It&apos;s a strategy that makes the Olympics seem effortlessly miraculous, a triumph of hope over experience. Pick 1948, for instance, and the first face that appears before you belongs to Joe Stalin.     The running track at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, where interactive exhibits predominate. Photograph: Arnaud Melan    A large part of this floor is devoted to marketing, and thanks to these displays, I now blame Los Angeles (1984) for the plastic tat each new Olympics brings forth. Before LA, there was real elegance to be found in the design of each games, from the art\u00a0deco glasses and toffee tins that were manufactured for Amsterdam in 1928 to the fantastic op-art patterns that were such a big part of Mexico in 1968 (in the museum shop, I came alarmingly close to buying an Adidas shoulder bag with &quot;Mexico &apos;68&quot; written across it). A collection of beautiful paper and silk fans celebrating the games goes all the way back to Stockholm in 1912. But after LA, it was downhill all the way (and hence to London, the jagged pink emblem for which was so outstandingly unattractive). In another part of this space, the visitor is invited to gaze on a motley selection of costumes from various opening ceremonies and, as a result, to consider yet again the genius of Danny Boyle (though Moschino&apos;s snowy dresses for the Winter Olympics in Turin 2006, which are decorated with miniature mountains, fir trees and skiers, are quite lovely up close). I&apos;ve already told you about the bobsleighs and luges to be found in the second gallery. But those in the market for this kind of sporting memorabilia will also doubtless enjoy looking at Jesse Owens&apos;s running shoes, a 19th-century Elswick racing bike with only one gear, and a cap that once belonged to Harvey Wood, the goalkeeper of the British hockey team in 1908. I can also reveal that Sir Chris Hoy&apos;s unitard \u2013 is that the right word? \u2013 from London 2012 is in excellent nick save for some light stretching in the groin area. Visit the museum soon, moreover, and you&apos;ll enjoy the bonus of a display dedicated to fencing (it is the centenary of the International Fencing Federation). Among the wonderful collection of masks on show is one that dates from 1760; it looks like an old egg basket sawn in two.     One of Moschino\u2019s dresses for the Winter Olympics in Turin 2006, decorated with miniature mountains, fir trees and skiers.    The third gallery is the weakest by far, ideas being so much harder to convey in a museum context than stories. You sense, too, the anxiety of the International Olympic Committee, which owns the museum and everything in it, about how best to treat the issue of doping. Visitors are, for instance, invited to look down a microscope beneath whose &quot;lens&quot; they will see photographs of the side-effects of banned drugs (acne for steroids, chapped lips for overuse of diuretics). But nowhere will you find hard facts about the success or otherwise of the drug-testing programme, or indeed the names of athletes who have been banned. Mostly what I learned from this section is that if Olympic medals continue to grow in size the way they have over the last 50 years, they will soon be as big as dinner plates. (Also, that a Michelin man-style &quot;concentration coat&quot; used by the Swiss team at Salt Lake City in 2002 \u2013 it was supposed to &quot;cocoon&quot; the athlete from the world, the better that he or she would be able to concentrate pre-race \u2013 was a resounding failure.) But I was also, by this point, as weary as any post-race athlete. The museum is exhaustive, and thus both quite big and quite repetitive. In this sense, it&apos;s surely a destination mostly for the Olympics obsessive, of whom there seem to be quite a few, rather than for the casual visitor (more than 45,000 people have passed through its doors since it reopened in December). Returning to retrieve my coat from my locker \u2013 I was using one marked with the name of Bruce Baumgartner, a freestyle wrestler who won gold at the LA Olympics, Bradley Wiggins&apos;s having disappointingly already been taken \u2013 I sat on a nearby bench for a moment, and closed my eyes. Oh, the Olympic Museum mark two has a great deal to recommend it \u2013 especially if, like me, you&apos;re perfectly happy to spend half an hour watching old clips of Steve Ovett and Sebastian Coe battling it out. But there are also moments when it&apos;s like being shouted at: &quot;Aren&apos;t the Olympics great?&quot; yells the voice in your ear. &quot;Aren&apos;t the Olympics just great?&quot;", "sentences": ["Before LA, there was real elegance to be found in the design of each games, from the art\u00a0deco glasses and toffee tins that were manufactured for Amsterdam in 1928 to the fantastic op-art patterns that were such a big part of Mexico in 1968 (in the museum shop, I came alarmingly close to buying an Adidas shoulder bag with &quot;Mexico &apos;68&quot; written across it)."], "title": "Olympic Museum \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/feb/02/olympic-museum-lausanne-review", "tags": ["Museums", "Sport", "Design", "Olympic Games", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-02-04T14:01:27Z", "article": "&apos;Prediction&apos; is misleading Ian Sample&apos;s article on super volcanoes is interesting, but his framing of &quot;prediction&quot; is dangerously misleading (Predicting smoke before the fire, 24 January). It has long been possible to foresee supervolcanic eruptions based on the geological record, which dates such eruptions, and geographic knowledge, which shows where they are most likely. What this new work does is improve understanding of why these eruptions happen and reduce uncertainty in certain localities \u2013 perhaps. This &quot;perhaps&quot; arises because the most likely times of occurrence are millennia in the future, so falsification will be difficult. This may seem like nitpicking, but Sample&apos;s presenting of prediction unfortunately reinforces an erroneous way in which science is interpreted. Too often the public is encouraged to believe that science-based prediction equates to certainty rather than likelihood or probability, with associated uncertainty ranging from the trivial (a few seconds or hours) to millennia. A recent outcome of this poor conceptualisation is the conviction of Italian earthquake scientists, where uncertainty was similarly misunderstood. An even greater travesty is the misunderstanding of climate change predictions, where significant uncertainty about short-term weather variation is used to obscure the near certainty of climate change catastrophe in the longer term and validate the pernicious short-term policies developed by politicians and economists. It&apos;s great that the Guardian reports good science. But it also needs to either explain the nature of the scientific method better or recognise it when writing about science.David RoserMarrickville, NSW, Australia The threat is immediate In the article High Andes gets on top of climate change (24 January), the author suggests that for poor indigenous communities climate change &quot;is not some distant threat&quot;, but an immediate problem. Anyone who has lived through the past 14 months in Australia, with 2013 the hottest year since records began and topped off by the breaking of temperature records across NSW in January 2014 \u2013 by more than a degree in some cases \u2013 must surely be aware that something is very amiss with our climate. Plants simply can&apos;t grow outside their tolerances of temperature and rainfall, birds and insects die; climate change is not something we will have to &quot;adapt to&quot;, it is a total game-changer for ecosystems, and we ignore that at our peril. The crunch will come when global wheat and rice crops fail in the same year. Philippa MorrisGravesend, NSW, Australia Many kinds of atheism Several times a week I bow to a shrine and light incense before sitting in meditation with a small group of other people. I am an atheist, but not the kind that Zoe Williams seems to have in mind in her column (24 January). I am a Zen Buddhist so I actively cultivate a mind free of the notion of a personal saviour or a distinct soul. Unlike Williams, I follow a precept not to indoctrinate my children into my beliefs, let alone raise them to believe that other people are mad for their beliefs. Strangely, I probably have more in common with contemplatives from theistic religions such as some Sufis and Christians than with what Williams describes. The kind of atheism she talks about seems to have a lot in common with the Deobandi Islam described by Jon Boone (Moderate Islam under siege in Pakistan). Her views are characterised by absolute certainty of her position (dogmatism), a presumption of uniformity of view across atheists (intolerance of heresy) and perceived victimhood. I think Williams may have been radicalised by the fundamentalist cleric Richard Dawkins and should be watched closely by the NSA, but then she probably already is.Roger HyamEdinburgh, UK \u2022 Zoe Williams is exactly right: atheists don&apos;t make enough fuss. It&apos;s the perennial problem of those driven by what they don&apos;t believe. At university in the 60s we were called woolly liberals, intent on achieving nothing more serious than raising a wry smile on the faces of evangelicals. This is why Richard Dawkins&apos;s rampant atheism is such an eye-watering breath of fresh air. Sadly, the rest of us woolly liberals don&apos;t quite know how to follow him to the barricades and probably don&apos;t have the energy anyway. Like sheep, our skills are more to do with counting people to sleep or keeping them snuggly warm in our wool.Peter RobertsHuddersfield, UK \u2022 To be an atheist is not at all the same thing as to be a heathen, and the fact that Zoe Williams does not seem to know that doesn&apos;t inspire confidence in the rest of her column.Patrick CurryLondon, UK The expat&apos;s challenge Roy Greenslade&apos;s light-hearted take on the Swedish military seeking someone to make fictitious broadcasts (Shortcuts, 17 January) displayed an incredible degree of insensitivity and ignorance of the challenges involved in living in a country whose main language is not your own. Learning a foreign language as an adult is always tough, especially in a country like Sweden, where the natural response to an immigrant&apos;s bumbling attempts to speak the \u2013 admittedly relatively easy \u2013 native tongue is to switch to English. As such, I could imagine that a job requiring native-American English proficiency and broadcasting skills but no competency in Swedish is nothing less than gold dust for a number of unemployed Americans with a background in media who have made the brave decision to, for instance, follow a Swedish partner back to their homeland in spite of the difficulties involved in such an endeavour. It beats cleaning up vomit on the notorious booze cruises that run between Finland and Sweden or stacking shelves in a supermarket: the lot of many an immigrant. Greenslade sneeringly instructs readers: &quot;Don&apos;t all rush.&quot; It&apos;s good advice; the result could be a stampede.Allan BainHelsinki, Finland The man sitting in his chair Gaby Hinsliff (January 17) warns us of how social media is &quot;purpose-built for killing time and showing off&quot;, giving bored people who are &quot;disappointed or dissatisfied with their own lives&quot; the opportunity to indulge in what she calls &quot;online vitriol&quot;. Alas, when Blaise Pascal wrote that &quot;all human evil comes from this, man&apos;s being unable to sit still in a room&quot;, he obviously didn&apos;t have an inkling that, over 300 years later, a man would be able to spread evil in the world without even getting up from his chair.Richard OrlandoWestmount, Quebec, Canada Perhaps a smaller wedding I do not know what the Greek word is for &quot;lack of common sense&quot;. Is it because it is too ordinary a complaint that Scott Stossel (A life ruled by anxiety, 17 January) does not include it in his list of afflictions? How can I take seriously a man who, knowing the number of phobias he suffers from, chooses to get married in front of 300 people? If I was allergic to almonds would I eat an almond croissant (yum, yum) just because people expect me to do so? A very private wedding (one can always invent a reason for doing so) plus a great party (one can always be seized by a convenient bout of flu) might have prevented Stossel from suffering from wedding anxiety. I cannot think of a proper reason for not choosing this solution. If there was one I can only apologise.Amy GibsonLondon, UK The hegemony of English I was intrigued by Harry Ritchie&apos;s rather self-righteous article condemning what he considers to be the hegemony of standard English, especially as it applies to the spoken language (24 January). I did find it ironic, however, that given his argument that non-standard English should be granted equal status, his article should have adhered so slavishly to grammatical convention. Had this not been the case, of course, it is unlikely that the article would have been published. It is also unlikely that his commentary on the subject would have been so cogent. I object to the pomposity of those who eschew the use of non-standard English as much as Ritchie, but I would also contend that it is critical that people understand what kind of linguistic register is most appropriate for any given context. Although this observation might not be a central premise of Ritchie&apos;s argument, I suspect that it is one that, at least in practice, he subscribes to wholeheartedly.Simon ClarkeNedlands, Western Australia \u2022 About 60 years ago, there was just such a debate in California: shouldn&apos;t black children be taught in &quot;Ebonics&quot; rather than standard English? They would have an easier job learning arithmetic, geography, history and so on, at least as long as it was not necessary to read the same textbooks that white middle-class children were given. It was obvious to enough of us why this was being suggested \u2013 even pushed, and the proposal never became law. Those black children would never go to college. They might not even be able to finish high school. They would, in any case, not compete for jobs with &quot;our children&quot; who do get degrees. The US needed, still needs, a proletariat and, if those who are still in the American middle and upper class have their way, the working class will soon be desperate enough to work at any menial job offered.

In just over five years, people have spent more than 10m nights in properties around the world and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people with extraordinary stories have become hosts, opening their homes to travellers in 192 countries. These hosts are teachers, artists, students and retired people who love sharing their home and their city. In the process, they&apos;ve also become the next generation of micro-entrepreneurs. Take Tessa, one of our hosts in London. She has a chronic illness which leaves her largely housebound. But she&apos;s now able to bring the world to her, welcoming travellers to her home from around the world. She&apos;s an unofficial ambassador to London&apos;s neighbourhoods, sending people to parts of city they might have missed. Maybe most importantly, she&apos;s earned extra money and stayed self-sufficient and in the home she&apos;s lived in for years. Tessa and the hundreds of thousands of people embracing the new trend of sharing are more than just a collection of stories. They are part of a new economic engine that is generating prosperity for neighbourhoods and local businesses, and helping families stay in their homes and people to pursue their dreams. The results are profound. According to a new analysis, the Airbnb community generated more than \u00a3502m in economic activity in one year in the UK alone. By renting their homes to travellers, 14,424 hosts in the UK earned essential extra income. Many of these homes are located in neighbourhoods that haven&apos;t benefited from tourism in the past: 72% of Airbnb properties in London are outside the main hotel districts. This influx of new tourism is helping to grow communities and rebuild neighbourhoods across the UK. All of this adds up to jobs and opportunity and I&apos;ve heard from countless people who said the money they earned through sharing has given them the freedom to start a new business or pursue their passion. These economic benefits are impressive, but they are just the beginning. Around the world, more people are sharing their homes, cars, time, skills and knowledge, and new business models such as Liftshare, Taskhub and Lyft are also not only inspiring trust between strangers, but also offering new and unique experiences across the UK. Of course, we&apos;ve learnt that sharing isn&apos;t always easy. For too long, countries in Europe and around the world have had laws for people and laws for businesses. The sharing economy is creating a new third category \u2013 people as businesses \u2013 and policymakers worldwide are examining how to encourage these new activities and put them on a sound, clear legal footing. Some regulators want to make it more difficult for people to do business with other people, and require instead that big business or onerous regulations mediate these interactions. That won&apos;t help anyone. But completely eliminating rules that protect the public interest isn&apos;t a solution either. Instead, we should work together on sensible regulations to ensure that the sharing economy makes people more financially independent, communities more resilient, and all neighbourhoods even better places to live and visit. We&apos;ve already seen governments in Hamburg, Amsterdam and Seoul embrace sharing with great success and we want this to reflect the future of the sharing economy, globally. The British government has begun conversations with sharing economy companies of all kinds to see what they can do to help this activity thrive even further in the UK. If we keep at it, we can address these matters and deliver even more economic benefits to cities around the world.\u00a0And we won&apos;t just be generating economic prosperity; the future of the sharing economy will be the beginning of a more interconnected world where you can be at home, no matter where you are.

He applied it to a small house in Uppsala, in his native Sweden, designed in 1949 by his contemporaries Bengt Edman and Lennart Holm and built of bricks. Were it not for that material, the house might stand as the very example of the light, ascetic, prim, nordic modernism that afflicted Britain for some years after the war. The Festival of Britain in\u00a01951 was actually The Festival of Plagiarising Scandinavian Architecture. Asplund&apos;s neologism caught on in Stockholm and was picked up by British architectural pilgrims to that city, among them Oliver Cox, Graeme Shankland and Michael Ventris, the decoder of Linear B (an ancient script seen as one of the great linguistic riddles). Although the epithet signified nothing, or maybe because it signified nothing, it was taken up as a slogan of defiance or something by arty young British architects, none artier than Alison and Peter Smithson and their representative on Earth, Reyner Banham, an architectural critic whose prose may cause all but the entirely insentient to wince. The Smithsons&apos; Hunstanton School in Norfolk, finished in 1954, derives from Mies van der Rohe and has little in common with subsequent buildings that were deemed brutalist. B\u00e9ton brut Banham expanded Asplund&apos;s coinage, turning it into a bilingual pun on the French b\u00e9ton brut \u2013 literally raw concrete. Exposed concrete, left rough and unfinished, would become the defining trait of brutalism. So Banham, with his weakness for feeble wordplay, linked brutality with concrete, even though there had\u00a0been concrete structures since the\u00a0Romans, most of them pacific. The shared etymology of brut and brutal was unfortunate. Monoglot opponents of brutalist buildings \u2013 knowing nothing of b\u00e9ton brut and apprised only of the English component, brutal \u2013 were handed the ammunition of what seems like a boast of culpable aggression. Or maybe not: the French, to whom the pun was clear, have been no more appreciative of their brutalist buildings than the English. Cit\u00e9 Radieuse Before the war, Le Corbusier&apos;s work was sleek, smooth, right-angled, rational. Postwar, he led the reaction against such architecture: he dumped a technical manual in favour of ecstatic poetry. La Cit\u00e9 Radieuse in Marseille, aka l&apos;Unit\u00e9 d&apos;Habitation, was the first of his\u00a0exercises in sculptural and plastic moulded concrete which, in spirit if not style, have affinities with the primitivist tendency of the arts and crafts. L&apos;Unit\u00e9 gave the word brutalism a meaning. Le Corbusier ripped off countless other artists and architects, notably Fernand L\u00e9ger, Pablo Picasso and most importantly Friedrich Tamms. Indeed, his later oeuvre can be viewed as a synthesis of thefts. Le Corbusier never applied the word brutalist to his own work.     Tricorn Centre, Portsmouth. Photograph: View Pictures/Rex    Dystopia Brutalism is the decor of dystopian films, literature and comics, just as gothic is for horror. See Alphaville, A Clockwork Orange, Blade Runner, Get Carter, La Haine. Books and films have of course impinged on the way brutalist buildings have been judged down the years, assisting in their condemnation. They have been found wanting beside the holyhocked cottages and winking dormers beloved by Blighty. Expressionism Brutalism, as Nikolaus Pevsner pointed out with some distaste, had its roots in expressionism, the jagged, often counter-intuitive, mostly brick idiom that flourished in the Netherlands, Germany and the Baltic states from 1910 to 1930. Its greatest exponent was Michel de Klerk, whose social housing projects in Amsterdam retain, a century after they were made, a beguiling freshness. Its kitschiest exponent was Bernhard Hoetger. His B\u00f6ttcherstrasse in Bremen, a street 100m long, was commissioned by the inventor of decaffeinated coffee, Ludwig Roselius, who dedicated it to Adolf Hitler. At the 1936 Nuremberg Rally, Hitler showed his gratitude by declaring it decadent.     Gottfried B\u00f6hm's Mariendom, in Neviges, Germany    F\u00f6rderer Vatican II was a godsend to architects. The Roman Catholic church was a generous, adventurous patron, and its buildings were to be advertisements for the church&apos;s newfound modernity. With few functional demands to take into consideration, architects enjoyed carte blanche. God can, apparently, live anywhere \u2013 and in the 1960s, he shared the widespread taste for open-plan spaces and theatre-in-the-round. The boundary between architecture and sculpture, which Le Corbusier had broached, was now comprehensively trampled. The architects who most took advantage of this were Walter F\u00f6rderer in Switzerland and Germany, Gottfried B\u00f6hm in and around Cologne, and Fritz Wotruba in Vienna. Their work defines brutalism. It is accretive, ostentatious, hyperbolic in its asymmetries and protracted voids, composed of parts that do not connect or are in a fragmentary state, dramatically vertiginous, geometrically farouche, extravagantly cantilevered, discomfiting, aggressive (in so far as an inanimate object can be \u00a0aggressive). There is no desire to please with prettiness or even beauty. The reaction demanded is that of awe. The quality that the greatest brutalist buildings manifest is sublimity. Geology Brutalist architecture did not seek to represent geological formations. It sought to create buildings that matched such formations, even challenged them. Mankind could take on nature and win, could make its own yardangs and hoodoos. Half a century ago, mankind lorded it over the earth. The practices of being friendly to vegetables and minerals, and of granting rights to animals were far in the future \u2013 though they had, of course, been de rigueur in Germany for 12 years, from the Nazis&apos; seizure of power to their defeat. H To anyone under the age of 50, brutalism belongs to the age of their non-existence. It is something that happened in history, while postmodernism is still with us. But now, having ransacked all other dressing-up boxes, architects have gradually turned to brutalism for inspiration. The most prolific is Jurgen Mayer Hermann, who trades as J Mayer H. His border checkpoints and service stations in Georgia might, at first glance, be taken for works of the 1960s \u2013 they are uncompromising, assertive, convinced of the artist&apos;s right to impose his vision without consultation, without accommodating consensual taste. Imperial College London Sheppard Robson&apos;s magnificent hall of\u00a0residence in South Kensington was finished in 1963 and demolished 42 years later. It is not shown on the practice&apos;s website. Nor are its slightly later and happily extant lecture halls at Brunel University. Are its current architects embarrassed by their predecessors&apos; work? Uneasy about how potential clients might react? Imperial College has form in this area. Some professor of a &quot;discipline&quot; called Sustainable Energy in Business defends the destruction of cooling towers thus: &quot;You have to think: how much does this enhance the landscape compared to what else we could do if we weren&apos;t having to maintain the towers?&quot; This is the very epitome of unreflective short-termism and a not-particularly-convincing justification for sanctioned vandalism. Jasari The School of Advanced Proxenetism, in Albania&apos;s capital Tirana, was designed by the late Nexhat Jasari, whose other works included soundproofed containers, experimental dungeons and the Presidential Bison Run.     Jonathan Meades in front of Skopje post office, Macedonia. Photograph: Francis Hanly/BBC    Konstantinov   Skopje \u2013 in Macedonia, then the southernmost Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \u2013 was largely destroyed by an earthquake in July 1963. The masterplan for rebuilding the city was undertaken by the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. Most of the actual buildings were designed by Yugoslav architects, among them Janko Konstantinov, whose post-office complex presages the wild and delirious spomenik memorials to the National Liberation War (ie the second world war). President Tito commissioned scores of these futuristic melds of architecture and sculpture, some of which have been recorded by Belgian photographer Jan Kempenaers. Many, however, were destroyed during the 1990s civil wars. Konstantinov&apos;s work also presages the weirdly joyous style of the later years of the Soviet satellites, the Leonid Brezhnev Plays Las Vegas school of architecture. Much of this has been recorded by the French photographer Fr\u00e9deric Chaubin.     The Trinity Square car park, Gateshead. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA    Luder The three finest works of British brutalism were designed by Rodney Gordon of the Owen Luder Partnership. They were: Eros House in Catford, London; the Tricorn in Portsmouth; and the Trinity in Gateshead. The first, a block of flats, is disfigured; the other two shopping centre and car park complexes have been destroyed in acts of petty-minded provincial vandalism. One can have nothing but contempt for the scum-of-the-earth councillors, blind planners and toady local journalists who conspired to effect the demolition of such masterpieces. One can only despair at the pusillanimous lack of support from wretched English Heritage. The dependably crass Prince of Wales, the man who sullied Dorset with Poundbury, described the Tricorn as &quot;a mildewed lump of elephant droppings&quot;, a simile as vulgar as it is visually inept. No doubt his heritage industry toadies removed their tongues in order to chortle a moment&apos;s laughter. The critic Ian Nairn was on the money: &quot;This great belly laugh of forms ... the only thing that has been squandered is imagination.&quot; Gordon&apos;s imagination was indeed fecund, rich, untrammelled. It was haunted by Russian constructivism, crusader castles, Levantine skylines. But the paramount desire was to make an architecture that had not previously existed. There are as many ideas in a single Gordon building as there are in the entire careers of most architects. The seldom-photographed street level stuff at the Trinity left the observer with the sensation of being in the presence of genius. One thinks of the burning of books. Monstrosity It took more than three-quarters of a\u00a0century before high Victorian architecture began to be rehabilitated through the efforts of John Betjeman, Evelyn Waugh, etc. Their pleas went unheeded. They were reckoned to be perverse and mischievous. Thousands of &quot;monstrosities&quot; were destroyed. The survivors are now widely valued, and lost ones are mourned. We\u00a0have learned nothing. Half a century after brutalism&apos;s heyday, the\u00a0term &quot;concrete monstrosity&quot; trips\u00a0readily off the tongues of the unseeing, the torpid, the incurious. Britain is once again being architecturally cleansed in favour of timidity and\u00a0insipidity. New Newness and change were bound to be for the better. When Harold Macmillan announced in 1957 that &quot;most of our people have never had it so good&quot;, some of our people were still living in caves (in the Severn valley), and many of our people had no bathrooms and shared outdoor toilets. Built along brutalist lines, new flats had all those amenities, plus central heating, and were welcomed by their occupants. Social-housing projects were not yet bins for sociopaths. But they would soon become so: if blocks are unguarded, if there are no janitors, if they are not maintained \u2026 You don&apos;t buy a car and never get it serviced. Organisation Todt The Nazis&apos; civil-engineering arm, named after Fritz Todt, built motorways and arranged their surrounds in order to achieve minimal damage to the landscape. These animal-lovers were nothing if not green. From the outbreak of war, its work was almost entirely martial. After Todt&apos;s death in 1942, the OT was directed by Albert Speer. Its architects included Werner March, author of the 1936 Berlin Olympics stadium, and the startlingly prolific Friedrich Tamms, who created the designs for 60 different types of gun emplacement, bunkers, shelters, flak towers, U-boat bases, etc. Tamms was, arguably, the first brutalist. He revived the expressionism that the Nazis had proscribed. The forms he used were seldom functional. Rather, they employ the imagery of might \u2013 vizors, chainmail fists, anthropomorphism and zoomorphism. They were terrifyingly graphic warnings to the people of occupied countries.     Sainte Bernadette church, Nevers. Photograph: Collection Artedia/VIEW    Parent The church of Saint Bernadette in Nevers, France, consecrated in 1966, is the work of architect Claude Parent and theorist Paul Virilio. For some years, they had been studying the thousands of structures that comprise the Atlantic Wall, the coastal fortifications built \u2013 by slave labour \u2013 along the west of Europe from 1940-44. The similarities between these structures and brutalist architecture had been brushed under the carpet. In their huge bunker-like church, Parent and Virilio make the link explicit. Quebec Canada&apos;s most extreme examples of brutalism are in Quebec City, which boasts Dimitri Dimakopoulos&apos;s boorish Concorde Hotel; and in Quebec Province, home to Moshe Safdie&apos;s thrilling Habitat 67, a collision of 150 residential units in\u00a0Montreal that appear to teeter perilously. The effect is both fragmented and monolithic: a labyrinth made by termites with an eye for right angles. Robbins The Committee on Higher Education, chaired by economist Lionel Robbins, sat from 1961-63. Its report recommended a massive expansion of tertiary education. New universities were to be built. Old universities and colleges were to be extended. One reaction was Kingsley Amis&apos;s observation that &quot;more will mean worse&quot;. Another was delight on the part of architects who saw an incomparably rich gravy train approaching. Denys Lasdun&apos;s University of East Anglia is perhaps the finest of the lot. The Roger Stevens building at Leeds \u2013 by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon \u2013 is agreeably weird. One minor nail, a drawing pin, in brutalism&apos;s coffin was its rapid espousal by the Wilsonian establishment, which caused half-witted spartist protest-kids to identify it with repressive authority. Soreq Those protest-kids have no doubt directed many howls of self-righteous anger at the Soreq Nuclear Research Plant in Israel. The architect was Philip Johnson who, in his long life (he lived to 99 and never retired), had jumped on many bandwagons and even started a few. One of this creepy socialite&apos;s many enthusiasms was Hitler, which makes an Israeli commission a matter of wonder. While his brutalist buildings in the US are as unconvincing as most of his oeuvre, this temple to radiation on the dunes a few miles south of Tel Aviv is impressive. Brutalism was the cold war&apos;s architectural mode, on both sides of the Iron Curtain \u2013 Mutually Assured Construction.     Kenzo Tange's Yamanashi press and broadcasting centre, Kofu, Japan    Tange Kenzo Tange&apos;s viscerally exhilarating Yamanashi press and broadcasting centre in the Japanese city of Kofu is a vast machine that seems to be missing vital parts. His Kuwait embassy in Tokyo might have been assembled from several vaguely similar extant buildings, while the Shizuoka press centre is all cages attached to a stout pole. Elsewhere, Tange hangs cantilevers at oblique angles and creates buildings that look as if they are in the process of collapsing. Utzon The Danish architect J\u00f8rn Utzon is celebrated for the Sydney Opera House. His essays in brutalism were failures, tentative and timid. Indeed, this was an idiom for which Scandinavians seemed to have had no stomach. A tragic lack of insensitivity and an excess of rationality no doubt militated against its adoption. Vanbrugh The proto-brutalist John Vanbrugh&apos;s buildings were widely lambasted while he was still alive. Blenheim was described as &quot;a quarry&quot;. When he died, the Reverend Abel Evans famously wrote: &quot;Lie heavy on him earth! For he\u00a0/laid many a heavy a load on thee.&quot; World&apos;s End This estate of seven London towers, between King&apos;s Road and the Embankment, was designed by Jim Cadbury-Brown and Eric Lyons. More than any other London scheme, it demonstrates brutalism&apos;s debt to expressionism, explicitly that of Hamburg and Bremen. It is restless, angular, red brick, complicated. Cadbury-Brown&apos;s earlier work included the Royal College of Art, an equally commanding presence. X Team X was a loose grouping of youngish architects, manifesto folk, who in 1953 broke\u00a0with CIAM (Congr\u00e8s International d&apos;Architecture Moderne) to pursue a less rational architecture \u2013 in other words, they had understood\u00a0the prevailing change of\u00a0mood. The\u00a0group included Le Corbusier&apos;s collaborators Shadrach Woods and George Candelis, who had been instrumental in changing that mood, and the Smithsons. In\u00a0Rachel Cooke&apos;s Her Brilliant Career, there is a photograph of the teenage Alison Smithson. At first\u00a0glance, it appears to be Kevin Rowland in Dexy&apos;s ragamuffin period. This is worrying. Yale Paul Rudolph began his career, in Florida, by designing light and airy houses, mostly of modular construction. He moved from these chamber\u00a0pieces to full-blown and very noisy\u00a0symphonies: massive, lumbering, sullen campus buildings that manifest a spectacular indifference to what anyone thinks of them. This is sod-you-ism at its most stubborn. One is obviously led to think of clumsy robots sodomising each other. Rudolph was dean of Yale&apos;s architecture school and author of that faculty&apos;s building. Among his pupils were Richard Rogers\u00a0and Norman Foster. Photoshop Rogers&apos;s Lloyds building and render it\u00a0as though it were built of concrete. Zapotec During the 1920s, there was a California craze for neo-Mayan architecture or, more precisely, exterior decoration. The pre-Columbian modes that attracted attention in the 1960s were the Zapotec and the Inca: massive, bold, cyclopean, devoted to 45\u00b0 slopes. Where building ends and natural formations begin is often moot. \u2022 Jonathan Meades&apos;s Bunkers, Brutalism, Bloodymindedness: Concrete Poetry starts on BBC4 at 9pm on Sunday. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2014 to correct Evans&apos;s epigram on Vanbrugh.", "sentences": ["Its greatest exponent was Michel de Klerk, whose social housing projects in Amsterdam retain, a century after they were made, a beguiling freshness."], "title": "The incredible hulks: Jonathan Meades' A-Z of brutalism", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/13/jonathan-meades-brutalism-a-z", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-02-13T20:59:00Z", "article": "For more than two decades, the international community has viewed the political landscape in Bosnia-Herzegovina through an ethnic lens \u2013 despite careful academic scholarship, which consistently warned against such over-simplification and dangerous pandering to local ethno-nationalist elites. The war, and the peace that has ensued, both overseen by international observers, have only emboldened the local ethno-nationalist partitocracy in BH, which \u2013 shielded by fears of new wars and new violence \u2013 proceeded to enrich itself in the country with the official youth unemployment rate of 57%. Not surprisingly, the wave of recent protests throughout Bosnia, which started in Tuzla, a working-class city, is focusing on job opportunities, pensions, health benefits, confiscation of illegally obtained property and formation of non-ethnic or technocratic governments. No demands are made based on ethnicity, religion, or any divisions that characterise BH in the stubborn international stereotype of it. As academics and scholars of the region, we call upon the international community to recognise alternative modes of political organising emerging in Bosnia, acknowledging at last that they are not all based on ethnicity. After repeatedly calling on Bosnians to take the fate of their country into their own hands, the international community should now extend their support to protesters and seriously consider their demands. In spring 1992, Bosnian citizens staged in Sarajevo the largest demonstrations ever against all nationalist parties. They were silenced by snipers, and their voices, from that point on, ignored by the international community. This time, the world should listen.

Their cry for a decent life, true democracy, solidarity that knows no borders \u2013 be they ethnic, national or religious \u2013 resonates throughout the world. In a similar fashion to the citizens of Tahrir, Taksim or Syntagma, the Bosnian protesters showed a courage to go beyond institutional obstacles and all limitations that governments around the world impose on their citizens and reclaimed their streets. The people of BH are standing against the system of exploitation, injustice and inequality that has been serving only a tiny political, economic and financial elite. A century after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, when imperialist European leaders pushed their nations into mutual destruction, Bosnia is sending a wake-up call to everyone. The world we live in is a world of divisions, expanding fascism, growing political and social apartheid, unrelenting capitalist destruction of both nature and common wealth of all. The citizens of BH have been experiencing all of that on an everyday level for 20 years. After the nationalist war between 1992 and 1995, in which 100,000 people lost their lives, the institutional peace settlement restored the capitalist system, destroyed the working and middle classes, and entrenched not only ethnic but also social divisions that have been successfully exploited by political elites. They said &quot;enough&quot; and we say &quot;enough&quot; with them. We voice our support for their legitimate efforts to create a just and equal society in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We call upon all progressive political and social forces to stand with the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina in this decisive struggle for a better future of us all.

The brand, which designs all its clothes at a couture-style atelier in Shoreditch, east London, will use the stores, near Harrods in London and on Fifth Avenue in New York, to launch a new image which ditches bling in favour of pared down, light stores. The London shop, almost double the size of Karen Millen&apos;s current flagship, will offer bespoke garments which can be made to order, a service which Karen Millen wants to take worldwide. &quot;What we do is evolving because our clients&apos; tastes evolve,&quot; said Mike Shearwood, chief executive of parent Aurora Fashions. &quot;In the UK the perception of the brand had become very narrow but internationally it&apos;s not just about going out dresses. It&apos;s more of a total wardrobe.&quot; The change in tack comes as the label, which already draws 70% of its sales from outside the UK, continues to expand abroad. It is set to move into Canada, Norway and India this year as it opens 40 new stores worldwide. Bespoke studios will also appear abroad.

This year I won\u2019t be seeing if one of my efforts made it on to the final list, because I have been one of the judges on the Sports panel. Even though I helped edit the 11,000 pictures down to six in each of the four sports categories, I still have no idea who has won. And my anticipation is higher this year than ever. I was glad to be invited to judge the awards even though in the past I have felt ambivalent about the awards. I have been critical of the sport section judging - I suppose some people (perhaps justifiably) thought my misgivings were a case of sour grapes. I saw myself as a mainstream sports photographer working solely in colour at high-level sporting events; whereas the winners at World Press Photo frequently seemed to emerge from minority sports and the sorts of pursuits that could be thought of as pastimes. I assumed that you needed to travel to the poorest ends of the earth, shoot in black and white and be creative with the manipulation. The vast majority of professional sports photographers have to shoot in colour, because that is what the media demands. Sometimes it seemed like the sport pictures were being judged by people with little interest or knowledge of sport. It felt like it was mainly a competition in the traditional image of photo-journalism, one where it was all war and suffering, and that the sport section was just tagged onto the coat-tails. But maybe I was wrong all along: I found out this year that the first ever winner of the competition in 1955 was actually a sport picture.     1955 winning photograph of a competitor tumbling off his motorcycle during the motor-cross championships at Volk M\u00f8lle racecourse in Denmark. Photograph: Mogens von Haven    Even though I felt it wasn\u2019t really my sort of competition I still wanted to support it and always entered in hope. The fact that sport specialists started to help out with the judging seemed like a great move. The number of sports categories started to go up, a sure sign of the importance the organisers were giving to the genre. Also winners started to emerge from the arenas where I was working, for example Gareth Copley\u2019s brilliant 2009 sports action winner from cricket at The Oval: a classic, straight-forward, decisive moment.  Last week I took the short flight to Amsterdam with refreshingly little equipment; it was a relief not to argue with the airline over excess baggage. I met up with my fellow judges, Miriam Marseu the picture editor at Sports Illustrated and Kerim Okten. We had a pep-talk by our non-voting secretary Simon Njami, a veteran of many a vote, there to oversee the whole day of judging for us, making absolutely sure the correct protocols were adhered to. This impression of meticulous procedure pervaded the whole day. Apart from us, the three judges and secretary, the only other people in the room were two or three silent World Press Photo staff who operated the equipment. Every picture was beamed onto the big screen in front of us with just a code in the top left corner. So every image was anonymous. In the first round of judging the images were shown one at a time with a black screen shown in between stories. To keep an image or story in the competition a single call of \u201cIn\u201d was needed by just one judge. But you had to be quick, as we had just a few seconds for each one: the picture had to have instant impact to get the shout of approval. Also at this stage we didn\u2019t have time to request caption detail. At times it felt a bit depressing to go through periods of silence where no images went through. Then suddenly you saw something good and the \u201cIns\u201d were heard again. I quickly realised that if there was anything slightly pleasing about the picture then I would get it through to the next round where we would have more time to discuss and debate.

Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA Archive/Press Association Images    Slowly we made our way through the four sport categories: sport action single picture, sport action story/portfolio, sport feature single picture and sport feature story. Between each category we would rush out of the room to get fresh air, bathroom breaks, hot drinks, daylight etc. After each category had their 1st round completed so we moved onto the 2nd round. Our aim in this round was to whittle down each section to six entries, which would then be passed onto the general jury for the final three rounds of voting that would eventually decide the winners and runners up. This 2nd round gave us the opportunity for much more discussion. We could request caption information which could be crucial as to whether the entry stayed in the competition. Also, each story would be viewed as a caption sheet on the big screen, allowing us to judge the narrative and development of the story. Here we could also see when each image was taken, be it in 2013 or before. If a story didn\u2019t make it through this stage we were also given the opportunity to vote a single image through to the relevant singles category. Gradually, as the afternoon stretched into evening, the judging in our little room carried on. It seemed to be getting colder and colder in there (maybe a deliberate move to keep us alert and awake; good job too as I once fell asleep in a college slide-show given by the great Martin Parr). We each sought refuge from the dipping temperatures by wrapping ourselves in the blankets provided. It felt a bit like being on a long-haul flight, discussing the merits of the in-flight movie with the passengers next to you. This impression was further enhanced when boiling hot flannels were handed out to refresh us for the final push to the end.     The 2012 winning picture in Sports Action Single. A competitor and his charges reach the finish of a bull race, in Batu Sangkar, West Sumatra. Photograph: Chen Wei Seng/WPP    The climax of our day was the judging of the sports action picture: I could sense how the organisers wanted this to be just right, maybe due to controversy caused by previous winners. We checked how technically sharp every picture was by examining each one closely on a computer screen; we were also on the lookout to make sure no over-manipulation had taken place (although this subject would be debated much further in the finals jury). Last year\u2019s competition was dogged by the debate surrounding Paul Hansen\u2019s overall winner, an image that was proved by forensic experts to have some post-processing but not enough to make it fall outside the rules. Maybe due to a tightening of the guidelines this year, I saw very few images where I thought something dodgy had occurred. Also it was at this stage we wanted to make sure that the image was taken at a \u201chigh-level\u201d sporting event as the category definition had decreed.     The controversial photograph shows the bodies of two year-old Suhaib Hijazi and her three-year-old brother Muhammad, who were killed when their house was destroyed by an Israeli missile strike, being carried on November 20 2012 in Gaza City. Photograph: Paul Hansen/Dagens Nyheter/EPA    At just past 11.00 at night we staggered across the finish line. After winding my way back to the hotel I crawled back into my bed absolutely exhausted but at the same time exhilarated. I closed my eyes but I kept seeing pictures. The images were ticking up every couple of seconds just like the projector had. I thought of the other judges, many of whom were seeing shocking sights; they were also going through many more images than me. Overall this year the World Press Photo competition had attracted 98,671 images from 5,754 participants from over 132 countries. It really is a remarkable photography competition, one that is very ethical, is immaculately organised and has the highest standards in professional photojournalism at its core, including I am pleased to say, sports photography.", "sentences": ["Last week I took the short flight to Amsterdam with refreshingly little equipment; it was a relief not to argue with the airline over excess baggage."], "title": "How to spot an award-winning sports photograph", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/14/how-to-spot-an-award-winning-sports-photograph", "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Awards and prizes", "Culture", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-02-14T18:03:34Z", "article": "1. It\u2019s not just all about the snow It\u2019s always the same story (for non-Nordic cities): 2in of snow and the town collapses \u2026 while Britain dramatically floods, many cities in the US are facing non-stop snowstorms. Just a couple of weeks ago, Atlanta shut down \u2013 thousands of flights cancelled, 2,000 school children separated from parents and all kinds of dramatic stories of people stranded in highways or buses emerging. Rebecca Burns recalls in Politico Magazine how many took it as comical that one of the largest metropolitan areas of the US was brought to a standstill by a few flurries, and how it was only a matter of time until comparisons with the poster of the zombie apocalypse in the TV show The Walking Dead started popping up all over the net. She goes on to explain, though, that \u201cwhat happened is not a matter of southerners blindsided by unpredictable weather\u201d and that this event, more than any other, underscores the \u201chorrible history of suburban sprawl in the United States and the bad political decisions that drive it\u201d. Mainly, a balkanised metro area with over 60 mayors \u2013 reportedly 1m vehicles were leaving downtown Atlanta when the storm hit; a transportation system monopolised by cars and one main highway \u2013 the \u2018downtown connector\u2019 \u2013 a public transport system that only serves a fraction of the region; and the rejection of a special tax for transport improvement in a 2012 referendum. The result of this dangerous mix was a total paralysis \u2013 from which the city seems to have learned the second time around as citizens chose to stay home.  2. What snow can tell us about unused urban spaces     A \u2018sneckdown\u2019 in Philadelphia. Photograph: Jon Geeting    As Dan McQuade puts it, snow is pretty when it falls, then it just lays there. And it gets ugly. This Philadelphia Magazine article explores an increasingly popular idea for a better use of public spaces triggered by the recent snow in the Pennsylvanian city. Its \u201dsneckdowns\u201d \u2013 from \u2018snow neckdowns\u2019, or the space where snow collects in the street revealing the parts of paved roads cars don\u2019t use \u2013 a term coined and expanding on Twitter.  As Philadelphia political journalist, Jon Geeting, chronicled that snow accumulation shows spaces that are reserved for traffic but that aren\u2019t used, and the idea is that these sneckdowns could be put to better use, such as pedestrian plazas \u2013 hence, making pedestrian feel safer and encouraging more foot traffic \u2013 without disturbing traffic or parking.  3. City logos - what for?      The 'I \u2665 NY' emblem is one of the most iconic among modern cities. Photograph: Photograph: Enid Alvarez/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images    After Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail newspaper commissioned eight new city logos for Toronto ny graphic designers, coinciding with the scandals surrounding its mayor \u2013 although not with this direct intention \u2013 a New Yorker piece questioned why, while it\u2019s not obvious that city logos bear any relation to reputation, cities persist at changing them.  Paul Hiebert traces city emblems back to 12-century Europe, and explains that while at first logos were a useful way of identifying various groups at a time when the peasantry was largely illiterate, \u201cin recent decades heraldry has been losing ground to modern graphics, as cities borrow from the logos of the corporate world\u201d. The article explores the interesting strategies that cities like New York, Amsterdam or Seattle envisioned behind the creation of world famous logos.  4. Refugee camps turned into cities The Zatari camp in Syria, currently hosting 100,000 Syrian refugees, was visited by CNN, who produced this report showing how its inhabitants live and work. This interactive map lets you explore this provisional city and includes beauty salons, three schools, vegetable gardens, a supermarket and even a makeshift \u201dChamps Elysees\u201d.  5. The ice metropolis Everything\u2019s bigger in China, including ice sculptures. The Harbin Ice and Snow World, in north-west China, is actually almost an ice city made of 180,000 cubic metres of ice. It includes structures from around the world, including the Empire State Building, the Colosseum and the Jade Belt bridge from Beijing, as this beautiful gallery by the New York Times Magazine shows. Last year, this festival \u2013 designed to promote winter tourism \u2013 attracted 800,000 visitors. A future ice Vegas? 6. What\u2019s your Williamsburg?  Apparently, each city has its own Williamsburg. Without entering the debate around whether this is good news or a catastrophe, this Gawker piece by Max Read wants to be a definitive list of \u201chip \u2013 or formerly hip and now just rich\u201d neighourhoods in North America but also a handful of European, African and Asian cities. Oh, and they include the Bushwicks \u2013 or \u201cnext Williamsburgs\u201d \u2013 too. Check if they got yours right.

And when you see the cows up to their knees in the water,&quot; Wils tuts and shakes her head. &quot;We are so lucky.&quot; Sitting at their oak dining table, looking out of the windows of their modern farmhouse at the newly planted saplings standing firm in the grey afternoon, the couple know what it is like to lose a home on a flood plain. . Their old house and fields were sacrificed to a flood management scheme that forced them to sacrifice their farm for the sake of 150,000 strangers in the city of Den Bosch, some 30km upstream. Both in their sixties, they now live on a &quot;mound dwelling&quot;, a man-made hillock with a flattened five-and-a-half acre top. There are eight dairy farms strung along the 6km dyke, like eight giant mud pies plunked down on the flat fields and linked by a raised road. All with the same large grey cattle sheds and newbuild houses in each plot. All but one of the 17 farms that had been scattered across the land before the government&apos;s Room for the River agency arrived have been demolished. &quot;That one goes in four weeks,&quot; said Nol, pointing to a tidy farm settlement behind mature trees. The project on the Overdiepse Polder, eye-shaped farmland enclosed between the curves of two rivers, is one of 40 programmes due to be completed by next year by Room for the River. Set up in 2006, the agency was given a budget of \u20ac2.2bn (\u00a31.8bn) to reduce the risk of Holland&apos;s four main rivers flooding. It has been busily lowering floodplains, widening rivers and side channels \u2013 basically giving the river space to cope with extra water \u2013 and moving 200 families, including the Hooijmaaijers, out of their homes. It&apos;s a project that the Irish government among others is interested in emulating and, after this winter, Britain may want to take note. The low-lying Netherlands has been fighting back water for more than 1,000 years, when farmers built the first dykes. Windmills have been pumping the stuff off the land since the 14th century and the Overdiepse Polder mound dwellings are based on what the earliest inhabitants built here in 500BC. One of the most densely populated countries on the planet, 60% of the Netherlands is vulnerable to flooding, and its peat-rich agricultural soil is subsiding even as climate change is raising sea levels. The country&apos;s universities are producing some of the world&apos;s best water engineers and managers and it is exporting its expertise abroad; the Dutch government has advised on water governance projects in China, Africa and Australia. The Netherlands has also learned from past mistakes \u2013 a 1977 report warning about the weakness of the river dykes was ignored because it involved demolishing houses. It took floods in 1993 and again in 1995, when more than 200,000 people had to be evacuated and hundreds of farm animals died, to put plans into action. Hans Brouwers is a senior rivers expert at Rijkswaterstaat Room for the River. He shudders at the idea of dredging or flood defence maintenance being neglected and says that the UK should look closely at where it has gone wrong this year. According to Brouwers, the clear demarcation of responsibilities in the Netherlands is crucial, as are the present projects that he is involved in pushing through. There are no financial packages for people who have to move. &quot;They get the market value of their house and that is all. We will help them find another place, but not financially. The only thing we do is to make sure that they do not lose money.&quot; He insists people will accept the situation &quot;if you are honest and proactive and go to people and talk to them and take their fears seriously&quot;. Only two cases have been taken to court by people who didn&apos;t want to leave, both of which have been won by Room for the River. &quot;Of course there is opposition and of course people are hurt,&quot; said Brouwers. &quot;They aren&apos;t singing and dancing about it. If you are the third generation in that house and you have to move it is terrible. But we have to find a way to live with water rather than fight it. Our task is clear. Our cashflow is constant. The programme is on track. Holland is divided and ringed by dykes and that will not change. We have built our cities for years close around rivers, we have given them no space so we have to change that.&quot; At Overdiepse, nine families chose to leave the area. &quot;When we first heard in 2001, we were shown a map and all of our area was coloured blue,&quot; said Nol. &quot;The farmers were surprised and worried and the first thought was no, we will not let this happen. But in the flooding of 1993 to 1995 we had a close call here. It was clear that something had to be done. Like the UK is having now, it was a wake-up call. So maybe if we co-operate we can be involved. For me, I decided to take the opportunity to invest in new dairy machinery and modernise in the new place. &quot;I don&apos;t think in the cities that what has happened here is a topic; they think water protection is the responsibility of the government and they trust them to take care of them. They get on with their daily lives. With dry feet.&quot; Harold van Waveren is a water management expert from the Dutch ministry of infrastructure and environment. His colleague is in the UK helping to advise on the flooding. He says that, while no risk is ever zero, the Dutch system is about taking nothing for granted and being constantly on top of maintenance of coastal and river defences. &quot;The Dutch are extremely proud of their water management and we have eight million people [almost half the population] living below sea level who depend on it. We have learned a lot from floods in the past, especially from 1953, the big flood which Britain also had, when we had a lot of damage and 1,800 casualties. We started the delta programme then and put a lot of flood protection in place. &quot;Our organisation is very important. We have regional water boards with their own tax system who are in charge of dredging and of the programmes of dyke maintenance. We have adapted climate change into urban planning, and development on flood plains has not been allowed since the 80s. More and more we are working with nature \u2013 on the coast, management is about building up the sand dunes and beaches. &quot;In extreme situations, of course, you have to fight but in everyday life you have to live alongside water. Sometimes people resent the spending that goes on dykes because they don&apos;t see the benefit the next day. That is why we are glad Dutch politicians agreed to constant funding. There is no end to this. It&apos;s a continuous process. We do not want to be surprised again.&quot; Several Dutch companies have experimented with amphibious housing. In 2005 one architectural company, Dura Vermeer, built 32 &quot;floating&quot; homes in Amsterdam, based loosely on old Dutch house boats. The plan was to beat the government ban on building behind the dykes which surround the cities, the equivalent of banning building in flood plains, by creating amphibious houses of two types: one that would be on dry land until it flooded, when it would effectively float up with the rising water; and another that was built over water but that could cope with its changing levels. Most of the houses are now holiday homes. Three years ago, Dura Vermeer built another 12 in Maastricht. &quot;They are a little more expensive than other houses but they need no more maintenance and they can be in very special places,&quot; said Glenn Mason of Dura Vermeer. &quot;We are not restricted as is the rest of Holland&apos;s housing. So much of Holland is below sea level and you can&apos;t build as you would normally, so we are running out of room and have to look to adapt our living style. We are one of the pioneers of working with water and now we are seeing a lot of other countries coming to look and to copy them.&quot; Mason said the Maastricht houses, costing from \u20ac200,000-\u20ac800,000, were not all sold yet &quot;because of the economic crisis and because there is a housing crisis too in the Netherlands&quot;. A tightening of regulations has made it harder for some people to get a mortgage. It may also be that people may joke about needing an ark but are uneasy about living in one. &quot;It is an experiment and at the moment all our floating houses are recreational homes. But in places like Rotterdam, where they are running out of space fast, we are looking at floating offices along with houses which are amphibious. It may well be the future.&quot; In Overdiepse Polder, Nol Hooijmaaijers shows off this week&apos;s seven new Friesian calves and says he believes the future has arrived. &quot;I&apos;m lucky, the farm is safe, the cows are safe, the people in the city will have dry feet,&quot; he said. &quot;I have a son who is taking over the farm, otherwise what would I have done? Just retired probably, given up.&quot; He shows the path down to the field that his cows take when they feel in the mood. &quot;Six metres, up here in our castle on the hill! Now let the water come. I would like very much to see that in my lifetime. We have done this for the next generation but I would very much like to see if it works. I would like the taxpayers to see that it works. Let the floods come.&quot;", "sentences": ["In 2005 one architectural company, Dura Vermeer, built 32 &quot;floating&quot; homes in Amsterdam, based loosely on old Dutch house boats."], "title": "The Dutch solution to floods: live with water, don't fight it", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/16/flooding-netherlands", "tags": ["Flooding", "Netherlands", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Environment", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-02-17T18:23:00Z", "article": "Juliette Gr\u00e9co, looking fabulous in her trademark black trousers and slender cashmere polo neck, is remembering the first time she sang in Rio de Janeiro. It was the 1950s, and she was far from famous, even in her native France. &quot;Thousands of tickets sold out in a day,&quot; she laughs. &quot;I found it extraordinary \u2013 until I realised a local newspaper had said I&apos;d be singing naked! They all wanted to see that French woman singing in the nude.&quot; We&apos;re at Gr\u00e9co&apos;s house on the C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur, sitting by a huge open fire crackling away in the middle of a vast whitewashed room with African masks on the walls and two big sofas. I was hoping we&apos;d chat beneath the lemon trees on her sun terrace, but today the\u00a0C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur is buried in mist and drizzle, which lent the lush landscape a strange melancholy as I ascended the winding roads to Gr\u00e9co&apos;s den in the hills above St Tropez. The icon of French chanson shares this place with her third husband, G\u00e9rard Jouannest, the pianist and composer who co-wrote the music and lyrics for 35 of Jacques Brel&apos;s greatest songs, including Ne Me Quitte Pas. Gr\u00e9co still looks astonishingly youthful, even though she wears no makeup, apart from her signature kohl eyeliner. This may be because she has never taken life seriously. Despite her astonishing, deep voice, she is prone to giggling like a teenager. Next to her, one can&apos;t help feeling ancient and slow, not least because she has just released a new album \u2013 at the age of 86. In Gr\u00e9co Chante Brel, she delivers 12\u00a0songs by the Belgian legend. One of the most striking is Amsterdam, which Gr\u00e9co has turned into a kind of psychedelic oratorio, evoking the Dutch capital&apos;s prostitutes and sailors drinking themselves into oblivion. It certainly captures Brel&apos;s dark inner world. &quot;I met Brel in 1954,&quot; she says. &quot;He was a gentle genius. His world, unlike mine, is violent and coarse, but the great thing about being a woman is I don&apos;t have to imitate him. I can be\u00a0myself.&quot; This, besides her singing, has always been Gr\u00e9co&apos;s great talent: being herself, a survivor, unique and untamed. Gr\u00e9co was just 16 when the Gestapo arrested her and her older sister in Paris in 1943. Their mother, a r\u00e9sistante, had vanished shortly before. Gr\u00e9co was released, alone, a few months later. Wearing just the blue cotton dress she&apos;d had on when she was arrested, and with no home to return to, she stepped out of the notorious Fresnes prison into one of the coldest winters on record \u2013 and walked the eight miles back into town. She turned to her mother&apos;s friend H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Duc, an actor and fellow r\u00e9sistante who lived in a shabby little hotel. Duc found her a room and some food, but Gr\u00e9co had nothing to wear apart from that blue dress and raffia sandals. &quot;I was so cold and so hungry,&quot; she says, &quot;that I stayed in bed for two years.&quot; Male friends, aspiring actors and art students, gave her clothes. Except they were far too big, so she rolled them up: shirts, jumpers, jackets, trousers, the lot. In the streets and cafes, heads turned \u2013 and a new fashion was born. And a star, too. Gr\u00e9co&apos;s look and intense gaze would soon be immortalised by the giants of photography: Willy Ronis, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Doisneau all shot Gr\u00e9co. Postwar life was harsh: food was scarce, housing shabby, but the feeling of freedom was a joy. &quot;We were poor,&quot; she says. &quot;But it didn&apos;t matter, for we were free at last, and we all shared the little we had.&quot; Gr\u00e9co, like all the artists and intellectuals of the time, lived on the left bank, renting a room with a bath tub. She never locked it, so other people could use it. &quot;The room wasn&apos;t great for sleeping: there were always a few friends who needed a shower in the middle of the night. I&apos;d find some of them asleep in the corridor \u2013 they&apos;d passed out before reaching the door.&quot;     Gr\u00e9co in 1961. Photograph: Erwin Lowe/Rex    With her long black hair and fringe, her penetrating stare and her oversized clothes, Gr\u00e9co became the left bank&apos;s muse, its existentialist mascot, the gamine girl photographers never tired of. She was keen on acting, but when she started singing, things took off in that direction. &quot;I wanted to be a tragedian, but a friend suggested I use my voice differently. I loved poetry and literature, so why not voice poems?&quot; Voicing is a good way of describing Gr\u00e9co&apos;s singing style. &quot;I am no Maria\u00a0Callas, that&apos;s for\u00a0sure,&quot; she\u00a0laughs, &quot;but I have had this truly astonishing career, touring the world, singing all those wonderful things in front of large crowds.&quot; She chose poems by the likes of Jacques Pr\u00e9vert and asked composers to set them to music. One was Joseph Kosma, who wrote soundtracks for Jean Renoir. When she sang Parlez-Moi d&apos;Amour, it was a sign that her days of earning a paltry five francs per show were over. This 1930s classic, now recorded in 37 languages, is one of those inimitable chansons about love and kissing that made French singers \u2013 from Charles Trenet to Georges Brassens to Serge Gainsbourg \u2013 famous the world over. Gr\u00e9co joined their ranks, and now Pr\u00e9vert was writing songs for her. And Jean-Paul Sartre, too. Yes, Sartre penned songs for Gr\u00e9co.\u00a0Ah, those were the days. &quot;Gr\u00e9co\u00a0has a million poems in her voice,&quot; wrote the\u00a0world&apos;s most famous\u00a0intellectual. &quot;It is\u00a0like a warm\u00a0light that revives the\u00a0embers burning inside of us all. It\u00a0is\u00a0thanks to \u00a0her, and for her, that I have written songs. In her mouth, my words become precious stones.&quot; Men were drawn to her. Women, too. Maurice Merleau-Ponty, the phenomenological philosopher, fell in\u00a0love with her; Simone de Beauvoir, acting as chaperone, introduced her to Truman Capote and William Faulkner (who looked the other way when, starving, she stuffed her bag with petits fours at a famous publisher&apos;s cocktail party). Miles Davis, playing in\u00a0Paris with Dizzy Gillespie, fell madly\u00a0in love with her. &quot;Sartre asked Miles why we didn&apos;t get married, but Miles loved me too much, he said, to marry me. You&apos;d be seen as a &apos;negro&apos;s whore&apos; in the US, he told me, and this would destroy your career. We saw each other regularly until his death. He\u00a0was one of the most elegant men I\u00a0have known.&quot; Davis was just one in a long list of\u00a0suitors: Gr\u00e9co has left dozens of heartbroken men in her wake. Two committed suicide, and a few others made failed attempts. The press tried\u00a0to make her feel responsible. &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t care what they say,&quot; she wrote\u00a0in Jujube, her 1982 autobiography. &quot;I don&apos;t believe I can inspire such\u00a0passion.&quot; Other men who fell for\u00a0her included the Hollywood tycoon\u00a0Darryl F Zanuck, who gave her\u00a0starring roles in John Huston&apos;s Roots of Heaven and Richard Fleischer&apos;s Crack in the Mirror. &quot;I played alongside Orson Welles in\u00a0both,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I don&apos;t think I have ever laughed as much in my life\u00a0as\u00a0during those years. The writer Fran\u00e7oise Sagan was always visiting me then, too \u2013 she was barely 20 and\u00a0really wicked, in the nicest way. We were like children. Orson was a genius and a gentle ogre, Fran\u00e7oise was\u00a0extraordinarily witty. We loved eating, drinking and being merry. You\u00a0should have seen us all after a dinner, roaring with laughter in St Tropez&apos;s deserted streets at night. We \u00a0were very naughty.&quot; The movie mogul David O Selznick once sent Gr\u00e9co his private plane so she could join him for dinner in London. He offered her a seven-year contract in Hollywood. &quot;I declined politely, trying not to laugh,&quot; she says\u00a0 &quot;It felt too inappropriate. Hollywood was definitely not for me.&quot; There was also the great French actor Michel Piccoli, who won her over during a dinner by making her laugh for the whole evening. &quot;A few weeks later, we\u00a0were married. And then, after a while, we both stopped laughing.&quot; Our conversation returns to Paris in\u00a01943. She lived off Viandox \u2013 a cheap\u00a0meat broth much like Bovril, served hot in cafes \u2013 and earned scraps\u00a0here and there, working in theatre and films as an extra, always trying to get more parts. When Paris was liberated in August 1944, she went\u00a0every day to the\u00a0Lut\u00e9tia hotel, where survivors from concentration camps were arriving. One day, among\u00a0a\u00a0crowd of\u00a0skeletal, liberated prisoners, she spotted her sister and\u00a0mother. &quot;What\u00a0I\u00a0endured in occupied Paris was nothing compared to their two years in\u00a0Ravensbr\u00fcck,&quot; she\u00a0says. &quot;We held each other tight, in\u00a0silence. There were\u00a0no words for what I felt at that instant.&quot; Gr\u00e9co is still in constant demand, and France&apos;s fascination with her shows little sign of dwindling. Hedi\u00a0Slimane, the fashion designer and\u00a0creative director for Yves Saint Laurent, recently photographed Gr\u00e9co\u00a0and asked her to be YSL&apos;s brand ambassador. And today, when she walks the streets of Paris, women of all\u00a0ages stop her and tell her she&apos;s been an inspiration to them. &quot;Phew,&quot; she says, roaring with laugher. &quot;I have been\u00a0useful after all.&quot; Some even ask if they can give her a kiss. What does she say? &quot;Please do!&quot; \u2022 Gr\u00e9co plays the Paris Olympia on 16 and 17 May. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2014.

His eyes were often bloodshot and he seemed to sweat a lot, his friends noticed. He had fallen for heroin. That was shortly after the 1983 March for Equality and Against Racism (also called the Marche des Beurs), the 30th anniversary of which has just been celebrated. Nasser went into Paris to join the march with his mates from the Bosquets estate at Clichy-sous-Bois, north-east of the capital. Nordine was the next to become a user, two years later. Both have died since, one in hospital in 1989, the other in 1993, of an overdose. Years later Mohamed Mechmache, the head of the community organisation ACleFeu, is still furious. At one point he stumbled on his cousin with a needle still hanging from his arm. Much as many other members of his generation, he is convinced &quot;the authorities did nothing&quot; to stem the plague of heroin, then HIV-Aids, which devastated France&apos;s estates. Thousands lost their lives unnoticed, just like Nasser and Nordine. But the health authorities have published neither statistics nor reports on this tragedy. Indeed until now few university researchers have focused on the explosive mixture of drugs, Aids, sink estates and immigration. But things are at last changing. France&apos;s National Research Agency (ANR) has just awarded funding to Anne Coppel and Michel Kokoreff, two sociologists specialising in drug addiction. Their mission is to write a history of heroin, in order to obtain a clear picture of what they describe as an &quot;invisible disaster&quot;, which they started investigating several years ago. In the early years of President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand&apos;s first term of office, drugs were plentiful and freely available not only in middle-class circles, but also for kids on out-of-town estates. Despite rampant unemployment and poverty, there was still a glimmer of hope as France&apos;s banlieue youth suddenly entered the political fray with the Marche des Beurs, asserting their right to a place in society. And just like everyone else, they wanted some fun too. On Saturday nights they would dress up and visit their mates, riding in a Citro\u00ebn DS saloon if one of them was lucky enough to have a factory job, or in a more humdrum Peugeot 504 borrowed from someone&apos;s father. Then they would drive to the Kiss Club or the Poney in Paris, or the M\u00e9tropolis in Rungis (among the few clubs that would admit second-generation immigrants). There they could taste anything they fancied. Nasser and Nordine would go &quot;wild&quot; on these outings, Mechmache says. &quot;With their mates they would smarten up, then at about 10pm a string of cars would tour the Bosquet estate at Clichy-sous-Bois, hooting their horns,&quot; he says. Imported from Amsterdam and distributed in Paris, heroin gradually spread through the banlieue estates. It soon proved deadly in high-rise blocks where poorly educated or unemployed youths wasted away their time. A drug &quot;to forget&quot;, heroin put an end to physical misery and sent users floating off on a cloud, well away from reality. In just three days they would be hooked. &quot;To begin with they would disappear to shoot up. But after a bit we&apos;d see them all over the place, in the stairwells and halls, the bike shed, up on the roof with the washing lines. We used to collect the syringes on the football pitch before starting to play,&quot; Mechmache recalls. There were endless illustrations of their wretched existence: strung-out teenagers selling their parents&apos; TV to buy that day&apos;s &quot;stuff&quot;; mothers sending kids back to their home village in north Africa to get off the drug; physical decline that parents could not understand; prison sentences for many, bringing deeper addiction; accidents leading to blood tests and the discovery of encroaching illness. Such scenes were repeated all over the sink estates around Paris, Lyon and Marseille. &quot;In 93 [the Seine-Saint-Denis department] intravenous [injection] was very widespread and contamination spread like it was networking,&quot; says Nelly Boulanger, former head of the Arcade organisation. &quot;Everyone passed round syringes just like a joint \u2026 We thought [Aids] was a gay disease. No one told us how serious it was and the risks people were taking,&quot; says Ahmed Kerrar, a sports instructor at the Paris suburb of La Courneuve, who lost about 15 friends. &quot;Mums would never go out without their jewels, never let go of their handbag for fear their boys might nick them to buy heroin,&quot; says Yamina Benchenni, who used to run a group for mothers trying to cope with drugs on the Flamants estate in Marseille. But the families were too ashamed and kept quiet. The first to wake up to the scale of the disaster were a few general practitioners. Didier M\u00e9nard, a family doctor at Les Francs-Moisins, Saint Denis, was horrified. &quot;The first HIV-positive drug addicts started appearing in 1985-86. As very few of us would treat them, they came in from all over the eastern suburbs. We did what we could, making it up as we went along, trying unauthorised replacement substances,&quot; M\u00e9nard says.     Heroin proved deadly in the high-rise blocks of French cities where poorly educated or unemployed youths wasted away their time. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features    At the time hospital departments were adamant that the only solution was enforced withdrawal and psychiatric supervision. It was forbidden to distribute syringes and opioid or morphine substitutes. The French Order of Physicians (the medical association) would strike off doctors who broke the rules. Some medical centres formed networks, on the sidelines of the health service that was deaf to their warnings. &quot;The public health service and many of our colleagues avoid addicts like the plague, and it&apos;s even worse if they&apos;re based in the banlieue. We were treated like dealers in white coats,&quot; says Fran\u00e7ois Brun, who works at a health centre at La Busserine, Marseille. &quot;The social security had ample warning, but it made no difference,&quot; Boulanger says. In many cases the sick became outcasts, victims of a form of social xenophobia. &quot;At the time there was collective denial. A few of us tried to raise the alarm, but the moment we mentioned Aids and drug addiction, they accused us of playing into the hands of the far right,&quot; Coppel explains. With no policy on stopping the spread of Aids \u2013 the first schemes for exchanging syringes were only authorised in 1991, with replacement substances following three years later \u2013 the Aids virus went on taking a fearful toll. &quot;We wasted five years. It was a hecatomb,&quot; M\u00e9nard alleges. The word crops up whenever we talk to those involved during those dark years. How many drug addicts died of Aids on French housing estates? With no official statistics, the phenomenon was ignored for several years. There are just the patchy figures collated by isolated doctors and a few non-government organisations working in the suburbs. &quot;Up to 2000 it was the main cause of death at my Francs-Moisins surgery,&quot; M\u00e9nard says. Kokoreff, a sociology professor at Paris-VII University, refers to eyewitness accounts gathered in Hauts-de-Seine, at Asni\u00e8res, Bagneux, Gennevilliers and Nanterre. &quot;On some estates not a single family was spared, either through overdoses, Aids or suicide,&quot; he says. &quot;All these deaths are drug-related.&quot; A study commissioned by Orly town council listed 210 heroin users in 1986; 10 years later half of them had died. Delafontaine hospital, a large facility north of Paris, registered 10 such deaths in 1988. Three years later the figure had reached 300. &quot;We had five horrifying years during which 80% of our patients died,&quot; says Dr Denis Mechali, a hospital registrar at the time. But reports by the health authorities make no mention of the death toll. &quot;The first ethnological surveys carried out by the ministry of health highlighted the importance of sharing syringes in the spread of the disease, but little was done to help these underprivileged groups,&quot; says Marie Jauffret-Roustide, a researcher at the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm). She believes the lack of representatives, in contact with the media and policymakers \u2013 unlike gay organisations such as Aides or Act Up \u2013 was a major disadvantage for youths on the estates. Reda Sadki, who headed the Comit\u00e9 des Familles organisation for many years, endorses this view. &quot;Only in 2001 did posters for the Aids-prevention campaign start featuring coloured or north African people,&quot; he says. Farida Ben Mohamed survived this catastrophe, perhaps because she only started using heroin five years after Nasser. HIV-positive, she is on therapy. The daughter of a Moroccan labourer, she explains that her life changed course one night in October 1980, when her brother was killed by a police officer. Everything went wrong after that. She began using alcohol, cannabis and heroin, wandered from place to place on the Flamants estate and the northern quarters of Marseille, and did time for shoplifting and drug-peddling offences. Ben Mohamed found out she was HIV-positive in 1993 when she went to a an accident and emergency unit for a sprain. She has been certified as an invalid for the past six years. &quot;I saw everyone from my generation dying off,&quot; she says. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be here without my parents, who went out looking for me in the bars.&quot; Now prevention schemes are standard practice, but drugs have nevertheless become an industry on some estates. &quot;We mustn&apos;t let young people go under, like they did with us,&quot; she says. Her tall but emaciated figure, her sunken eyes and jutting cheekbones are testimony to her tragic tale.

No, this isn&apos;t the start of a JL Carr novel; it&apos;s a genuine conundrum faced by bookish 20 and 30somethings across the UK. With relentlessly rising rents, and record numbers of young people having to move back in with their parents, it&apos;s become clear that we are a nomadic generation. As a student in Leeds I moved house three times in four years; in London it was seven times in three years. My experience was driven by the problems facing everyone renting in the capital; dodgy landlords, relocation for work, rent hikes, unemployment, a triple infestation of cockroaches, mice and pigeons. We&apos;ve all been there. Regularly having to load your possessions into laundry bags and crisp boxes takes a toll on your finances and energy, but the effect on our book collection is rarely considered. Maintaining a collection of beloved books in a damp flat with no shelves, which you&apos;ll probably have to move out of in six months&apos; time, is a challenge. Prioritising which books to keep and which to jettison becomes increasingly difficult. Do you hold on to the books you know you&apos;ll reread or do you keep the to-be-read pile intact? I have a copy of A Literature of Their Own by Elaine Showalter which, invariably, is forced on some unsuspecting friend right before every house move and then reclaimed the next day. A few of them have attempted to speed-read this fairly dense feminist literary history in the 48 hours I usually let it out of my sight but most have now learnt not to take it out of the bag. Donating books to a charity shop or local school may be virtuous, but when you haven&apos;t had time to read them since your last move it becomes depressing. I dutifully moved a copy of Infinite Jest through six different postcodes, without reading it, until a recent move to Amsterdam meant choosing between 1,079 pages of David Foster Wallace and my hairdryer. Some books we can&apos;t give up for the oddest of reasons; there&apos;s a copy of Much Ado About Nothing I&apos;ve been moving around for nearly a decade because Beatrice&apos;s speech to Benedict about eating Claudio&apos;s heart in the marketplace is the only piece of Shakespeare I have ever managed to memorise. &quot;Just buy a Kindle!&quot; you might argue \u2013 but for many people, books are more than just books. They offer us an emotional connection to the past, to the person who gave it to us. They are a way to brighten up a dingy flat, they are a link to home, they are the hardest thing to move and the most enjoyable thing to unpack. A recent essay by author Thomas E Kennedy in The New Yorker&apos;s Paragraphs Lost column focused on an elderly bibliophile wandering around his house looking for a book. It&apos;s beautifully written but, for someone living in rented accommodation, it&apos;s the size of his house rather than the style of his prose that makes an impression. He has multiple rooms, multiple bookcases; the man has so many books, he can lose books within his books! So what do you do if you&apos;re moving into your childhood bedroom (which, if you&apos;re lucky, hasn&apos;t already been colonised by a younger sibling)? What if you&apos;re already facing your second move this year and can&apos;t bear the thought of pensioning off more of your beloved books? You start reading more. Read every book in your current bedroom and work out if they&apos;re worth the trip, give away as many books as you can, leave books with trusted friends to be reclaimed at a later point. Start looking at your books creatively; that stack of unread Daphne du Maurier novels can be a wobbly beside table. That copy of The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman becomes a draft excluder. The idea of worrying about your book collection when you&apos;re facing homelessness does, at first, seem slightly ludicrous. Anyone faced with logging onto Spareroom every lunchtime and trailing around dark streets with greasy estate agents every night would immediately swap their entire library for a guaranteed place to stay. But when you are trapped in the rental market, feeling at home in your overpriced, underheated room is important. Until councils start building more houses than they sell off, the majority of young people are going to be renting for a long time. While MPs score points off each other in the housing debate and then go home to their mansions, don&apos;t we all deserve one Billy bookcase full of favourite reads and yet to be discovered treasures?", "sentences": ["I dutifully moved a copy of Infinite Jest through six different postcodes, without reading it, until a recent move to Amsterdam meant choosing between 1,079 pages of David Foster Wallace and my hairdryer."], "title": "Moving stories: what do you do with your books when you change houses?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/feb/18/moving-books-change-houses-personal-library", "tags": ["Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-02-21T12:51:00Z", "article": "     The Royal Dutch Guide Dog Foundation: &apos;Buddy&apos; (starts at 00:06) - Netherlands This film promoting the work of a Dutch guide dog charity opens with a nightmarish scene from a war zone.\u00a0 When it turns out to be exactly that \u2013 a nightmare \u2013 it&apos;s a specially-trained dog who eases the military veteran from his unconscious recollections.\u00a0 If you didn&apos;t know about this aspect of guide dog work, it&apos;s truly eye-opening and will have dog lovers welling up in appreciation.\u00a0\u00a0 Agency: Selmore (Amsterdam)Director: Rogier Hesp Team Canada: &apos;What&apos;s There?&quot;\u00a0 (Starts at 00:45) - Canada While this doesn&apos;t quite hit the heights of Channel 4&apos;s Meet the Superhumans film promoting the broadcaster&apos;s coverage of the 2012 London Paralympics, it is nonetheless built on a similarly empowering idea.\u00a0And it&apos;s clever to use a changing letterbox ratio to support the idea that our focus should be directed at what these remarkable athletes can do rather than concentrating on the limitations their disability places upon them.Agency: BBDO TorontoDirector: David Quinn Booking.com: &apos;Booking.yeah&apos; (starts at 01:48) - UK In this commercial for an online hotel booking service, a succession of bombastic vignettes shows people glorying in the magnificence of the hotels they&apos;ve booked.

The aim is to make information on aid spending easier to access, use and understand. In a nutshell, more transparent. So how does it work? To publish to IATI, groups have to register and provide information on all their activities across 40 fields, from their budgets to relevant sectors, through special files and software. Dedicating the time and resources to carry out this process is easier for some groups than others. Of the 224 organisations that have published so far, small NGOs have found it the most difficult. In a piece for the network, the president of Plan USA Tessie San Martin reflected on her NGO&apos;s experience publishing to IATI for the first time, and the challenges it faced. &quot;Why did we scale back on our ambition in the first phase? The answer is partly people, partly systems and partly concerns over losing our competitive edge,&quot; she said. The publishing process itself \u2014 of registering, aligning information systems or entering data manually \u2014 is no doubt time consuming, but developing an open information policy can be just as big a barrier to publishing. To address these issues and discuss how best to overcome them, we&apos;re bringing together IATI experts and trainers with development groups to share their perspectives in a live workshop on Thursday, 27 February, from 1-3pm GMT. From 1-2pm we&apos;ll discuss the implications of publishing to IATI, and concerns NGOs, like Plan USA, might have. Should they see competition as a valuable byproduct of open data, NGO director Eric Stowe suggests? Then, in the second hour we&apos;ll move on to processes. For data entry, when are publishing platforms like AidStream useful, and how can groups prepare data to fit IATI&apos;s formats? Experts will share practical tips for those looking to publish for the first time, or move from one step to another.

The gallery&apos;s director, Emilie Gordenker, said they were on budget and scheduled to reopen what is widely acknowledged as one of the most beautiful small museums anywhere.     The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius. Photograph: Francis G Mayer/Corbis    The Mauritshuis has a particularly fine collection of Dutch Golden Age paintings. As well as owning three works by Johannes Vermeer, it has important works by Rembrandt and Jan Steen, and Fabritius&apos;s The Goldfinch, made newly famous by Donna Tartt&apos;s novel of the same name, published last year. Gordenker said the 17th-century building, stunning though it is, did not fully meet the needs of a 21st-century visitor, so when the opportunity to buy an art deco building across the road came up, they leapt at it. &quot;The challenge for the architects was, how do you unite these two very different buildings and make them one?&quot; she said. The Amsterdam-based practice Hans van Heeswijk proposed going underground, so visitors will now enter the building by a lift or stairs going down to a new foyer. From there, the choice will be to go into the historic permanent collection or into the 1930s building for temporary exhibitions and a new education centre. Gordenker said they were anticipating a 25% increase in visitor numbers to 300,000 a year. The Girl with a Pearl Earring, subject of the Tracy Chevalier novel and subsequent film, has been on a world tour while the museum has been closed. Gordenker said: &quot;We are very keen for the Girl to go back to her old room, she&apos;s getting a little homesick. But we are looking at measures to control crowds.

At the centre of it all is the festival itself, which this year is playing host to a huge range of international performers all booked by festival director David Sefton, in his second year in the job. \u201cWith the proviso that I booked everything,\u201d he gives us 10 shows he\u2019s particularly anticipating. 1. Roman Tragedies Created by Toneelgroep Amsterdam, Roman Tragedies stages Shakepeare\u2019s Coriolanus, Julius Caesar and Anthony and Cleopatra as one sprawling, six-hour show in which the audience is invited to mingle with the performers. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge coup,\u201d says Sefton. \u201cIt\u2019s in my top 10 shows of all time, and you can imagine how much I see in this job. It\u2019s long but you can get up and walk around, you can get up onstage and get a drink, you can go and watch a bit of it outside on the telly \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter what your attention span\u2019s like, you can engage with it. There\u2019s wireless on stage \u2013 one friend who saw it did a bit of email. You can file a review during the show. The whole point is that it\u2019s meant to look like a CNN rolling news, chronological version of the Shakespeare Roman plays so the idea of you sitting on a sofa watching it on TV is completely consistent. It\u2019s a fantastic piece of work and at the centre of it are a bunch of the best actors in Europe.\u201d Adelaide festival centre, 28 February - 2 March            2. River of Fundament Running at five and a half hours, this film by artist Matthew Barney and composer Jonathan Bepler stars Maggie Gyllenhaal, takes Norman Mailer\u2019s famously impenetrable novel Ancient Evenings as its jumping-off point, and has already been described in the Australian as a \u201ctorrent of filth\u201d. \u201cIt ties into the collapse of the car industry in America and has all these other points of connection,\u201d says Sefton. \u201cI\u2019ve ended up with two incredibly long shows on the same weekend. There\u2019s a history in Adelaide of the epic \u2013 we did The Mahabharata here, The Seven Streams of the River Ota was a massive hit here and the first Australian Ring Cycle was done at this festival. I\u2019m adding to an honourable tradition.\u201d 2-3 March, Capri theatre            3. Sadeh21 The Israeli dance company Batsheva made their Australian debut at the Adelaide festival in 1996 and are back for the first time since then. \u201cI rate them as one of the greatest dance companies on the planet,\u201d says Sefton. \u201cSadeh21 is very intense \u2013 it\u2019s not narrative dance, it\u2019s abstract but it\u2019s an emotionally engaging and at points quite unsettling piece. There\u2019s nothing flowery about Batsheva.\u201d 5-8 March, Adelaide festival centre            4. Kiss of the Chicken King A play by Oscar McLennan, who created the show based on one of his novels set in London in the early 80s. \u201cHe and I first worked together 29 years ago,\u201d says Sefton. \u201cIt\u2019s a multimedia piece \u2013 there\u2019s video and music and at the core of it a very engaged, dark, intense monologue. That\u2019s a festival comission so it\u2019s brand new.\u201d 1 and 4 March, Queen\u2019s theatre            5. BigMouth \u201cIt was at the Edinburgh fringe the year before last and it became the runaway hit of the fringe \u2013 I booked it on the spot. It\u2019s literally just this guy Valentijn Dhaenens doing historical speeches from Plato to George Bush over the course of an hour but it\u2019s just a fantastic performance. I sat there in Edinburgh going \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like this before\u201d. He makes these political points as he goes \u2013 he doesn\u2019t explain them to you, it\u2019s just the order in which he chooses to put the speeches. It\u2019s extraordinary. Coincidentally, he\u2019s in Fight Night as well \u2013 we got two for the price of one with him.\u201d 1-3 March, Queen\u2019s theatre            6. Fight Night A collaboration between the Adelaide-based theatre company The Border Project and controversial Belgian troupe Ontroerend Goed, Sefton describes Fight Night as \u201ca piece about the nature of politics and the nature of voting which is happening at exactly the same time as we have the South Australian elections. Every member of the audience gets to vote on the people who stay on the stage and the people who leave, and it\u2019s the job of the actor to convince the audience to vote for them. There are various twists and turns which I won\u2019t spoil.\u201d Last year, Ontroerend Goed staged a trilogy of plays which involved sometimes uncomfortably intimate one-on-one engagement with the audience, but Sefton says that this is a very different work. \u201cIt\u2019s not confrontational, it\u2019s an interactive piece that involves your engagement but nobody shouts at you or hits you or anything. No-one\u2019ll sit in your lap this year.\u201d 13-16 March, Queen\u2019s theatre      Ontroerend Goed perform Fight Night  at the Traverse Theatre at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Photograph: Murdo Macleod    7. Fugitive, School Dance, Girl Asleep \u201cWindmill is a local theatre company that makes work for designed for children and young people that\u2019s also completely entertaining to adults \u2013 it\u2019s funny and smart and clever,\u201d says Sefton. \u201cThey came to me about their new piece, Girl Asleep, which is their Sleeping Beauty and Rosemark Myers the director said this was the third of a trilogy, so I said \u201cwhy don\u2019t we do all three?\u201d As a company they\u2019re getting a huge amount of interest \u2013 they\u2019re nationally beloved and becoming internationally known. Being able to put them up against all the international work is great.\u201d 28 February to 17 March, Adelaide festival centre             8. Unsound and Tectonics \u201cI\u2019m going to cheat and put these things together,\u201d says Sefton of the festival\u2019s two avant garde music strands. \u201cTectonics is a new thing for us puts together the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra and everyone from Stephen O\u2019Malley from Sunn O))) right through to very respected contemporary composers. \u201cUnsound is the returning electronica strand which everyone told me would fail last year and was such a resounding success I had to bring it back just to prove I was right. It\u2019s mainly in the Queen\u2019s theatre but we\u2019re using the Town Hall to perform a the live score to Snowtown, the bodies in barrels film.\u201d Based on a famous South Australian mass murder case, Sefton points out that the film is \u201ca local story \u2013 but not one we put in the tourist guide.\u201d Unsound: 6-8 March, Adelaide Town Hall and Queen\u2019s theatre. Tectonics: 9 and 10 March, Grainger Studio and Queen\u2019s theatre.            9. Needles and Opium  A theatre piece directed by the revered Robert LaPage. \u201cIt was first done 20 years ago with slides,\u201d chuckles Sefton. \u201cHe\u2019s gone back and redone the visuals which were a very important part of it and now it\u2019s in high-definition video. The show\u2019s about the relationship between art and addiction. There\u2019s a Miles Davis thread through the story and various other artists famous for their relationship to drugs.\u201d 13-16 March, Adelaide festival centre            10. John Zorn \u201cPeople have been trying to get him here for 25 years and this is the first time he\u2019s ever played in Australia,\u201d says Sefton of the avant garde composer and performer. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a complete four-night career retrospective with 40 people coming from New York to play with him. Dave Lombardo, the original drummer of Slayer, Mike Patton, half of Tom Wait\u2019s band - most of them are coming to Australia especially for this. \u201cIt starts with a five-and-a-half hour concert, the Masada Marathon. Then we\u2019re doing a whole evening dedicated to his classical repertoire, then a night devoted to his film scores that looks at his work with Bill Laswell, including Blade Runner. The fourth night is Zorn at 60 which is the big compilation show that toured the world. This breadth of his work has never been shown in the same place before.\u201d 11-14 March, Adelaide festival centre             This post was amended on 5 March 2014 to correct the spelling of Tectonics.

Ho Chi Minh City, half a world away in Vietnam, is a fast-growing megacity clogged with motorbikes; an extraordinary mixture of old and new, rich and poor. Different as they seem, the two cities have something crucial in common. Both sit on river deltas, and are defined \u2013 and increasingly threatened \u2013 by their relationship with water. Perched near coasts astride major rivers, with tributaries running through neighbourhoods, these two port cities are on the front lines of climate change. Now they are coming together in an unusual partnership, sharing coping strategies as their positions grow more perilous. Rotterdam, with long experience in flood management, is advising Ho Chi Minh City on the development and implementation of a climate adaptation plan to help the Vietnamese city avoid disaster as sea levels rise and the frequency and severity of storms increases. This east-west collaboration could hold important lessons for flood-threatened cities around the world. Ho Chi Minh City and Rotterdam are both seeking to strike a balance between the two main approaches to flood protection: bolstering expensive, hard protections while also &quot;making room for the river&quot; \u2013 creating space for water to run without damaging developed areas. Added to the mix are new ideas such as dotting flood zones with playgrounds that can hold run-off water when needed. For all the cities&apos; differences, says Alexandra van Huffelen, Rotterdam&apos;s vice-mayor for sustainability, Ho Chi Minh City &quot;really felt the same [as us]; the same issues arose&quot;. Its leaders initially sought Rotterdam&apos;s advice because, she recalls, they saw the Dutch city was also grappling with &quot;more water coming down the river at unexpected times, problems with extreme rainfall, rising sea levels, salinisation levels and issues with groundwater \u2013 exactly the same issues they were facing.&quot; In truth, Rotterdam and Ho Chi Minh City share similar DNA, each bustling with the energy typical of a business-minded shipping hub. Unlike other Dutch cities, whose streets are lined with graceful, centuries-old homes, Rotterdam was nearly flattened in the second world war, and it has rebuilt itself with a modern sensibility. Rem Koolhaas&apos;s new De Rotterdam megatower is the latest example of its architectural ambitions.     During the rainy season, some parts of Ho Chi Minh City flood twice a day. Photograph: Stijn Koole    Ho Chi Minh City has also known war, of course. Its wide French boulevards and elegant but decaying old buildings mix with communist-era blocks and modern shopping malls and skyscrapers. While the Dutch are famous for the carefully engineered dikes, sea walls and other barriers that protect their low-lying home from the sea, the Vietnamese have learned to live with water, building floating buildings and homes on stilts, and selling goods from longboats in the Mekong delta&apos;s floating markets, south of Ho Chi Minh City. &quot;It&apos;s a more traditional way that they are using,&quot; says Van Huffelen. &quot;They come from a more natural way of protecting themselves; we come from a more infrastructural way. We&apos;re meeting each other halfway. They&apos;re learning from us about storm surge barriers and dikes and things like that, and we&apos;re learning from them [that] you need to work with nature, and let nature help you protect the coastline.&quot; In the rainy season some parts of Ho Chi Minh City flood twice a day, with waters rising almost knee high when the tide comes in. Residents are forced to learn resilience, says Chantal Oudkerk Pool, a Rotterdam climate adaptation expert who\u00a0is closely involved with the Ho Chi Minh City effort. &quot;You have no choice but to protect your home by elevating the ground floor,&quot; Oudkerk Pool says. &quot;They all have tiles on the floor. Here, we have expensive wooden floors, and if the water comes, we have thousands of euros in damage. They just mop the floor and it&apos;s done. Very simple, but very effective.&quot; Ho Chi Minh City&apos;s flooding problems are likely to get worse as the impact of climate change intensifies and the city&apos;s fast growth continues; its population of roughly 8 million is expected to reach 12 million by 2020. A third of Ho Chi Minh City suffers regular flooding now, and if expansion into low-lying areas continues unchecked, two-thirds could be vulnerable in a decade. According to one of the intercity collaboration&apos;s advisors, Ho Long Phi, over the past 10 years the Vietnamese authorities have installed $1bn (\u00a3600m) worth of protection measures for the city&apos;s centre, reducing flooding even as peak tides have risen and intense storms have become more frequent. But in that time, says Phi, who is director of Vietnam National University&apos;s centre of water management and climate change, the population of the low-lying suburbs has boomed, and they now require $3bn in new protection measures. \u00a0     Storm-surge barriers at the port in Rotterdam. Photograph: Frans Lemmens/Corbis    It is this cycle of haphazard planning that Phi hopes the Dutch will help local officials break. Rotterdam, widely viewed as a world leader in resiliency planning, developed a climate adaptation strategy in 2008; a year later, officials from the two cities first encountered each other through Connecting Delta Cities; a network founded by Rotterdam which also includes Tokyo, Jakarta, London, New York and New Orleans. After months spent researching the scope of Ho Chi Minh City&apos;s challenges, the two cities signed a memorandum in 2011 appointing a consortium of public and private sector experts to begin work on the plan. Their efforts culminated in the delivery of a major adaptation strategy last year, laying out six broad goals such as increasing water storage and drainage capacity, and making sure flood risk informs development decisions. The Vietnamese then signed Rotterdam on for phase 2 of the effort (now just beginning), in which the Dutch will help local planners apply the ideas more concretely. The Dutch government has put \u20ac1.4m (\u00a31.15m) into the project, and corporate participants hope to profit from their presence in Ho Chi Minh City in a setup the teams refer to as &quot;Vietnamese ownership, Dutch partnership&quot;. For the first six months, Giao Lan Phuong \u2013 a Ho Chi Minh City-based project manager from the engineering consultancy Grontmij \u2013 served as a translator. Now, however, the Vietnamese participants have improved their English so much that interpretation is rarely needed, Phuong says. &quot;We understand each other and we learn from each other. Of course, we have different cultures, [but] all the people from both sides are very open and we talk to each other.&quot; Jeroen Aerts, professor of water management and risk at Amsterdam&apos;s VU University \u2013 another part of the Ho Chi Minh City consortium \u2013 stresses the need to pay attention to cultural cues to make such a collaboration work. While the Dutch are used to speaking directly in meetings, Aerts explains, &quot;in Vietnam it&apos;s different. If you are in a workshop with a high official, other people wait for them to say something. You need to understand how it works, and if you understand it then you really can do something.&quot;     Ho Chi Minh City has learned to live with the Saigon river, creating floating buildings and homes on stilts. Photograph: Guardian Cities    Like many flood-prone areas, Britain included, both Rotterdam and Ho Chi Minh City are debating when to build expensive protection infrastructure and when to retreat, letting the water take some areas so that others can stay dry. In Rotterdam, a few neighbourhoods have been designated as occasional flood zones, with resilient homes that feature measures like electrics placed high off the ground.\u00a0&quot;You can&apos;t protect everything, and you need to give the river its room,&quot; Van Huffelen says. Rotterdam has come up with some clever solutions which could be tweaked to fit the needs of its Vietnamese partner, Oudkerk Pool says. These include measures like &quot;water squares&quot; \u2013 patches of land that serve as playgrounds or parks in good weather but become holding basins for runoff when floods come. Beneath some of its underground car parks, Rotterdam has installed storage tanks that play the same role, releasing excess water only when the city&apos;s drainage system can handle it. The Dutch experts are urging Ho Chi Minh City officials to plan carefully as the city&apos;s population booms, ensuring that newly developed areas include lots of green space, which can act like a sponge during deluges, and special pavements that absorb water rather than speed its runoff. Not everything that has worked in Rotterdam can be transferred directly to Ho Chi Minh City, in part because it is a far poorer city, and its governing institutions are less effective. &quot;You can&apos;t just copy and paste. You have to base it on your real capacity \u2013 and the Dutch people cannot understand us as well as we understand ourselves,&quot; Phi says. &quot;We have to match our abilities with our vision \u2013 the vision could be the same, but the way is totally different.&quot;", "sentences": ["Of course, we have different cultures, [but] all the people from both sides are very open and we talk to each other.&quot; Jeroen Aerts, professor of water management and risk at Amsterdam&apos;s VU University \u2013 another part of the Ho Chi Minh City consortium \u2013 stresses the need to pay attention to cultural cues to make such a collaboration work."], "title": "Project blends Rotterdam knowhow with Ho Chi Minh City street smarts", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/feb/28/rotterdam-knowhow-ho-chi-minh-city-project", "tags": ["Cities", "Netherlands", "Vietnam", "Flooding", "Water"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-01T13:31:07Z", "article": "A painting that made Vincent van Gogh&apos;s name will go on sale this month after almost half a century hidden away in private ownership. Le Moulin de la Galette depicts a windmill against a sunny sky above Montmartre in Paris. It was first shown in public in Amsterdam, 15 years after Van Gogh&apos;s death. Later it was the proud possession of the powerful American industrialist who inspired Ian Fleming to create his arch-villain Auric Goldfinger, the quintessential enemy of James Bond, whose closest companion was a fluffy white cat. Van Gogh painted the work in April 1887 at a key point in the development of his vibrant, colourful style. During a two-year period, just after he had moved to Paris to live with his brother, Theo, the impoverished painter moved away from his customary dark studies of Dutch landscapes and his paintings took on some of the mannerisms of the impressionist movement in the hope that they might sell. Encouraged by Theo, he set up his easel by the windmills near their apartment in the artistic quarter above the French capital. When the painter died from self-inflicted wounds in 1890, his many unsold works passed to his brother. But when Theo died in January 1891, his wife, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, inherited them all. The widow was determined to prove her late brother-in-law&apos;s talent to the world and set up a series of exhibitions showcasing his work. The most influential of these was a major exhibition staged at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in 1905. The label on the back of Le Moulin de Galette reveals that this work was included in that crucial show. Unusually, the painting is also clearly signed by Van Gogh. &quot;This is a painting that has everything,&quot; says James Roundell of Dickinson, the dealer that will handle the sale for an anonymous private collector. &quot;It is\u00a0rare to have such a prominent signature in a work of this date and it is one of only two of his series of paintings depicting windmills of Montmartre still in private hands.&quot; The year after the Amsterdam show, Johanna gave the picture to the painter Isaac Israels, the man who had been her lover following her husband&apos;s death. He gave her a portrait in exchange. Following Israels&apos;s death in 1934, the increasingly valuable painting passed through more than one collection before Charles Engelhard, the flamboyant president of the Engelhard Minerals and Chemicals Corporation, bought it in 1958. Known for his high living, Engelhard owned a fleet of private jets and a stable of champion racehorses, including the Derby winner Nijinsky. He had made his fortune importing precious metals, including some South African gold thought to have been bought in secret to avoid export restrictions. He numbered the Kennedy family and Ian Fleming, creator of the James Bond thrillers, among his friends and spent millions on amassing a first-class art collection, featuring works by Manet and Monet, as well as Van Gogh. Engelhard met Fleming when he became a customer of the London bank Robert Fleming &amp; Co, founded by the author&apos;s grandfather. Fleming was intrigued by Engelhard&apos;s extravagant lifestyle and when he wrote Goldfinger, published in 1959, he based its eponymous villain on him. Engelhard seems to have taken this as a compliment and began calling one of the stewardesses on his private jet Pussy Galore, after the character played in the film by Honor Blackman. The name Goldfinger was purloined from the architect Erno Goldfinger, who did not feel so relaxed about it. The painting is expected to sell for an eight-figure sum at the annual TEFAF art fair in Maastricht in the Netherlands, which will also see an important work by William Hogarth offered for sale for the first time since the 18th century. The Fine Art Society will be taking The Beggar&apos;s Opera II, one of Hogarth&apos;s first works in oils, for presentation in the year that marks the 250th anniversary of his death.", "sentences": ["It was first shown in public in Amsterdam, 15 years after Van Gogh&apos;s death.", "The most influential of these was a major exhibition staged at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in 1905.", "&quot;It is\u00a0rare to have such a prominent signature in a work of this date and it is one of only two of his series of paintings depicting windmills of Montmartre still in private hands.&quot; The year after the Amsterdam show, Johanna gave the picture to the painter Isaac Israels, the man who had been her lover following her husband&apos;s death."], "title": "Half a century on, Goldfinger's Van Gogh goes up for auction", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/01/goldfinger-van-gogh-for-auction", "tags": ["Van Gogh", "Art and design", "Ian Fleming", "Books", "James Bond", "Thriller", "Film", "UK news", "Goldfinger"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-02T00:07:00Z", "article": "&quot;Have you heard of the artist James Turrell?&quot; asks Chris McVoy, partner in Steven Holl Architects of New York, and inside me something dies. When architects mention Turrell, it means that they have seen his installations and think that, because like him they play with white walls and light, they can make something as mesmerising. However valid their work in other ways, they can&apos;t. It is like thinking that any painting of yellow flowers is a Van Gogh. It&apos;s not as if the Reid Building did not already have issues of comparison with genius. Built to house the design department of the Glasgow School of Art, it is face-to-face, across the width of Renfrew Street, with Charles Rennie Mackintosh&apos;s building for the school, of 1897 to 1909. There may be no other building in the British Isles at once so original in its conception, brilliant in its execution and profound in its influence. As McVoy says, it includes &quot;one of the best facades in architecture, period&quot;. The Reid Building&apos;s proximity to Mackintosh caused a stir, including on these pages, when it was still a set of drawings, provoking the criticism that it was not worthy of its neighbour. But Steven Holl, with whom McVoy co-designed the building, is not afraid of creative ambition. He has a reputation as one of the more poetic of American architects, who has based designs on the music of Bart\u00f3k, the paintings of Klee and the phenomenological philosophy of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. He aims, in his words, &quot;to realise space with strong phenomenal properties while elevating architecture to a level of thought&quot;. He likes to design his buildings through a series of watercolour sketches, a sort of visual handwriting which suggests that some tantalising reality, too beautiful to be precisely drawn, is about to be captured. A selection of these sketches, showing the development of the Reid Building design, is currently on show in the exhibition space of the Mackintosh building.     Inside the Reid Building \u2018driven voids\u00a0of light\u2019 are intended to create a\u00a0tissue of social space where \u2018creative abrasion\u2019 can take place between students.  Photograph: Murdo Macleod    With the Reid Building, Holl and McVoy talk a great project. They say that their work forges &quot;a symbiotic relation with Mackintosh in which each structure heightens the integral qualities of the other&quot;. Also that &quot;working simultaneously from the inside out \u2013 engaging the functional needs and psychological desires of the programme \u2013 and the outside in \u2013 making connections to the city campus and relating to the Mackintosh building opposite \u2013 the design embodies the school&apos;s aspirations in the city&apos;s fabric&quot;. The main idea of the design is to construct a robust concrete structure to withstand the wear and tear of a design school, wrapped in a cladding of matt, cloudy glass. As in the Mackintosh building the &quot;basic building block&quot; is the studio or workshop, well lit and of generous volume, that is stacked up to make the building. Three cylinders are then thrust through at an angle a few degrees of the vertical. Called by Holl &quot;driven voids of light&quot;, their purpose is both to bring light into the centre of building and to form part of &quot;a circuit of connection&quot;. A sequence of stairs and galleries rises through the centre, sometimes connecting with the &quot;driven voids&quot; which are intended to create a tissue of social space where &quot;creative abrasion&quot; can take place between the students. Sometimes you contemplate the voids from outside of them, sometimes they offer niches in which you can sit.     \u2018Each floor is a new experience.\u2019 Photograph: Murdo Macleod    The building&apos;s proportions are governed by the &quot;golden section&quot;, while the &quot;driven voids&quot;, each rising to a circular oculus, are meant to evoke primordial architecture. By catching changing light &quot;they go back to universal time, the time of the seasons&quot;, says McVoy. The interior is one of &quot;rhythm, counterpoint and melody&quot; that offers &quot;surprises&quot;, such that &quot;each floor is a new experience&quot;. There are &quot;a few special details when your hand touches the space&quot;, such as designed-by-watercolour handrails. As well as Turrell and Mackintosh, Le Corbusier and Piranesi are invoked as inspirations. There are tributes to locality. An external terrace is to be planted to resemble a piece of machair, the coastal pastures particular to parts of Scotland. The architects &quot;decided to hire an artist&quot;, the Turner prize-winner Martin Boyce, to create in the entrance foyer a reinterpretation of Mackintosh&apos;s use of stained glass. The Assembly Building, an old stone building housing a legendary student bar, has been incorporated into the new structure. As for the crucial encounter across Renfrew Street, the aim here is for &quot;complementary contrast&quot;. Mackintosh built a flat facade in reddish stone, Holl in greenish glass with projecting and receding volumes. Mackintosh worked with detail and ornament, as the craft skills of his time allowed him to do; Holl tries to make the best of modern techniques of glass-making. The old and the new are said to &quot;sing&quot; and &quot;dance&quot; together.     Charles Rennie Mackintosh's 1909 Glasgow School of Art facade, right, opposite Holl's \u2018greenish glass\u2019 neighbour. Photograph: Murdo Macleod    Heard with eyes shut, this is a terrific building. With eyes half-open it is rich, complex and intriguing, but the more you look, the less convincing it becomes. The studios are as spacious\u00a0and light-filled as advertised, but the &quot;driven voids&quot; are not quite the emissaries of the celestial that they\u00a0are meant to be, rather conceptual devices with which the architects, as architects sometimes do, seem to have become over-obsessed. They compete with other light sources, and they obstruct flow as much as they permit it. Contradiction can be a valuable part of architecture, but here it feels accidental.     A light-filled studio. Photograph: Murdo Macleod    The quality of the finish isn&apos;t up to the intellectual ambition. Yes, roughness is a good quality to have in an art school, but this doesn&apos;t justify badly patched concrete, jagged shapes of balustrade, or approximate encounters of glass, metal and concrete that look unthought. Outside, the contrast with the older building is less complementary than mismatched, more haggis-and-sorbet than Parma ham and melon. It&apos;s a shame, as the School of Art tried hard to do a good job and secure an architect of international reputation. I have seen small-scale works by Holl in Amsterdam and Seattle that bear out his poetic reputation, and a large one in Beijing which, due to brutal construction techniques, does not. The Reid Building is somewhere between the two in scale and quality. Above all I blame the watercolours. As we&apos;re talking poetry let&apos;s cite WH\u00a0Auden, for whom &quot;every man likes the sight of his own writing, just as he likes the smell of his own farts&quot;. It is also possible for architects to be so entranced by their fluent brushstrokes that they lose touch with some of the realities of their construction projects. This might be seen, for example, in the work of Santiago Calatrava, who as well as designs for buildings regularly produces watercolours of bulls and ecstatic women. If Holl wants his talent to flourish he must break the spell that he has over himself. Charles Rennie Mackintosh will survive this Glasgow kiss. It is just that\u00a0the two projects together, with all\u00a0the good intentions that went into the new one, could have been something marvellous.", "sentences": ["I have seen small-scale works by Holl in Amsterdam and Seattle that bear out his poetic reputation, and a large one in Beijing which, due to brutal construction techniques, does not."], "title": "Reid Building review \u2013 Mackintosh's 1909 Glasgow School of Art has a new neighbour", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/02/reid-building-review-mackintosh-glasgow-school-art-steven-holl", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "Glasgow School of Art"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-02T18:01:23Z", "article": "The huge cost of flood damage is set to soar fivefold across Europe in coming decades, according to the first comprehensive analysis of risk across the continent. The cost of homes, belongings, businesses and infrastructure wrecked by the wettest winter in England for 250 years has been at least \u00a31bn and over the last decade the average annual loss across the European Union has been \u20ac4.5bn. But increasingly intense downpours driven by climate change, as well as population growth and urbanisation, will see that rise to \u20ac23bn a year by 2050, the study found. The growing prosperity of citizens is also a factor, according to Brenden Jongman, a researcher at the VU University Amsterdam, who led the new work. \u201cPeople increasingly have more expensive stuff \u2013 like expensive televisions and other gadgets \u2013 than they had 50 years ago,\u201d he said. The costs of damage could be curbed by better flood protection and insurance schemes, but faces political obstacles, according to Jongman. \u201cFor rare events [like England\u2019s wettest winter on record] the chances of it happening within the term of one government is low, so the incentive for politicians to invest in flood protection is quite low,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cost is upfront but the benefits are over decades.\u201d The UK\u2019s coalition government cut annual flood defence spending sharply after entering office in 2010 and the Guardian revealed earlier in February that projects in flood-stricken areas from the Somerset Levels to the Thames valley were not built as a result. The new research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that improving flood defences across the EU to resist once-a-century flooding would save \u20ac7bn a year by 2050 but cost just \u20ac1.75bn. In the UK, most flood defences save \u00a38 for every \u00a31 spent. \u201cA lot of countries still have quite low levels of flood protection standards,\u201d said Jongman. \u201cThere are a lot of places where it can be improved cost effectively.\u201d The UK government\u2019s official advisers have warned that the \u00a3500m underspend will result in \u00a33bn of avoidable damage. The new work also shows that two-thirds of all losses are uninsured. Despite the UK government\u2019s difficulty in agreeing a new flood insurance scheme with the industry to ensure affordable cover for high-risk homes, Britons are better off in this regard than many Europeans. \u201cMany countries do not have any flood insurance system at all,\u201d said Jongman. The research is unique in two respects. First, it takes account of extreme weather events that cover large areas, such as the record wet winter that affected not only England but elsewhere in the UK, northern France and parts of Germany and the Netherlands. Previous analyses treated each river system as being affected by its own weather but that approach underestimates the damage caused by once-a-century events by eight times. Secondly, it is the first analysis to account for the actual level of flood protection on each river, rather than using averages. The team found that major flood damages that were once unusual, like the \u20ac12bn cost seen when large parts of central and eastern Europe were submerged in June 2013, will occur every year by 2030, without further action. Jongman said that spending on flood defences is usually increased in reaction to disasters: \u201cIt mainly happens after big flood events, that is the main driver.\u201d Spending in the UK rose steeply after the Pitt review into the devastating 2007 floods, but that rise was reversed by the coalition.", "sentences": ["The growing prosperity of citizens is also a factor, according to Brenden Jongman, a researcher at the VU University Amsterdam, who led the new work."], "title": "Flood damage cost to rise fivefold across Europe, study says", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/02/flood-damage-cost-europe", "tags": ["Flooding", "Environment", "Climate change", "Weather", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-03T07:00:00Z", "article": "I meet John Sinclair in a canalside coffeeshop in Amsterdam, where the vibes are mellow, the air perfumed, and the soundtrack a stream of vintage rock songs of the more laidback kind. Compared to slightly self-conscious young pot tourists skinning up at a nearby table, Sinclair seems utterly relaxed, an ageing hippy blissfully at home in a city that still retains some of the libertarian values he fought so hard for \u2013 a fight that cost him his liberty at the tail end of the 1960s. &quot;I live here about half the time,&quot; he says, his voice a low, gravelly drawl that seems to grow even lower and more gravelly each time he inhales. &quot;I&apos;m not really an urbanite, but I love it here. Everything is close, public transport works, and it&apos;s OK to get high.&quot; He grins. &quot;It&apos;s my kind of town.&quot; It is, however, a long way \u2013 literally and metaphorically \u2013 from Detroit, the city where Sinclair made his name, and that of the rock group he managed, the MC5, in the most dramatic fashion. Almost 50 years after those culturally heady and politically tumultuous days, when he found himself at the heart of the race riots that raged through Detroit, the 72-year-old now keeps the freak flag flying as best he can in a world that has become more liberal, and paradoxically more conservative, than his younger self could ever have imagined. He has just recorded an album of jazz poetry, Mohawk. The rhymes, originally written in the early 80s, have been given a kind of post-modern jazz setting by his musical collaborator, Steve Fly, a soft-spoken young producer and multi instrumentalist who hails from Stourbridge, but now resides in Amsterdam, where his day job is managing another coffee shop near Central Station. &quot;John did all the vocals in one session,&quot; elaborates Fly, &quot;and then I spent three months recording and overdubbing the parts. We could just have hired a Theolonius Monk-style piano trio but that would just have made it an exercise in nostalgia.&quot; For all that, Mohawk, sounds out of time, its free-styled beatnik verse dedicated to Sinclair&apos;s musical heroes \u2013 Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Max Roach, \u2013 and couched in the language of his other big influence, the Beat poets. The words are delivered over a soundscape by his musical collaborator Steve Fly that deftly pastiches the original rhythms and swerves of bebop. It is, on every level, a labour of love. &quot;Man, I worshipped those guys as gods when I was young,&quot; he says, relighting his joint. &quot;Coltrane, Albert Ayler, Pharoah Sanders. That&apos;s where I was coming from, not rock or folk.&quot; In 1966, Sinclair and Charles Moore, the jazz trumpeter who helped him found the Detroit Artists Workshop in 1964, headed for New York City. &quot;We knocked on Cecil Taylor&apos;s door, then we went to Archie Shepp&apos;s house and knocked on his door. They thought we were crazy, but we were two 23-year-olds hungry for wisdom. They didn&apos;t have people like that in the white world. You had to go out there and find the cool people.&quot; Sinclair was, and remains, a believer in the transformative power of what he calls &quot;righteous&quot; music. When he met the fledgling MC5 in 1966, he was already a poet, jazz reviewer and activist of some repute. He immediately picked up on their sense of possibility and, though inexperienced, offered his services as a manager. &quot;They were a mess, man,&quot; he chuckles. &quot;Not only did they not have a manager, they didn&apos;t even have a roadie. They would show up when they were supposed to be playing on stage, and then spend an hour setting up and arguing over who owned what guitar lead. And all the while, the audience was sitting there, waiting. It was kind of tragic. I helped knock them into shape.&quot;            Reading on mobile? See the MC5 play Kick Out the Jams here As the 2002 documentary MC5: A True Testimonial showed, under Sinclair&apos;s guidance the MC5 soon became arguably the greatest high-energy, hard-rock group of that, or any other, time. Their only real rivals in the down-and-dirty stakes were that other great Detroit rock group, the Stooges, but unlike them, the MC5 had a radical political vision that was transmitted through the music. It was delivered with a visceral thrust that, even on grainy, black-and-white YouTube footage, is still breathtaking. The MC5&apos;s live sound, described by one rock writer as &quot;a catastrophic force of nature the band was barely able to control&quot;, was nothing less than an incitement to revolution. &quot;We wanted to kick ass and raise consciousness,&quot; Sinclair says. &quot;Most performers will admit that sometimes, for whatever reason, you just go out there and do the show. The MC5 never ever went out there and just did the show. They played every gig like it was their last. They wanted to level the audience like rubble. Every night. That&apos;s why it was way too intense for the hippies on the west coast. They hated us, man. But in Detroit, we made total sense.&quot; Central to the MC5&apos;s difference from their contemporaries, Sinclair says, was their blue-collar upbringing in America&apos;s most industrialised city. &quot;A lot of those radical groups of that time, the Yippies, the SDS, didn&apos;t know anything about the working class because they didn&apos;t know any working-class people. Same with black people \u2013 they didn&apos;t mix with any black people, didn&apos;t have black friends. The MC5 were working class, they knew about life on the streets. And we dug black people cos that&apos;s where the great music came from and the great weed and the refreshing concepts of sexuality. All that stuff didn&apos;t come from no white people. Are you kidding me?&quot; The MC5&apos;s revolutionary tendencies did not go unnoticed: when Sinclair formed the White Panther party, in solidarity with the Black Panthers, the FBI began to monitor the group&apos;s communal house in Detroit. As race riots devastated the city in the summer of 1967, a banner appeared on the exterior bearing the words: &quot;Burn baby burn.&quot; The building was stormed by riot police who claimed a sniper had been firing at them from the roof. &quot;We were harassed 24/7,&quot; says Sinclair, &quot;busted for incitement, obscenity, possession, whatever they could throw at us.&quot; At some gigs, armed police lined the walls, waiting with batons drawn for the band&apos;s rallying cry: &quot;Kick out the jams, motherfuckers!&quot; Then it was another night in the cells, another obscenity charge. Undeterred, the MC5 were the only group to show up and play to protesters in Grant Park at the Democratic party convention in Chicago in 1968. This was in defiance of a ban on live music implemented by the city&apos;s infamous mayor, Richard J Daley. The event ended in running battles between the police and demonstrators. The following year, Sinclair was arrested after offering two marijuana joints to an undercover narcotics officer. In a verdict designed to send out a strong message to the underground, he was sentenced to 10 years. It must have been quite a wake-up call. &quot;Well, yes and no. I mean, I was part of the revolution, and that&apos;s what authoritarian states do to revolutionaries. So it was part of my job. I accepted it. Plus I had a lot of support from my political comrades on the outside, and I was a hero to the guys on the inside, who hated the pigs with every fibre of their being. Those guys loved me.&quot; He served more than two years, writing daily missives to the outside world and becoming a countercultural cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, as a campaign to free him snowballed. It culminated in the John Sinclair Freedom Rally in the Michigan city of Ann Arbor in December 1971. Stevie Wonder, Allen Ginsberg and Bobby Seale of the Black Panthers shared a stage with John Lennon and Yoko Ono in an event that sold out in minutes. Three days later, Sinclair was released. The following year, Lennon included the track Free John Sinclair on his album Some Time in New York City. &quot;I heard the song while I was in prison,&quot; says Sinclair, beaming at the memory. &quot;I made them bring me in a tape because I didn&apos;t believe Lennon had written it and that he was coming to Ann Arbor to sing it. It was a beautiful thing to do.&quot;            Reading on mobile? See a documentary about John Sinclair and Mohawk here I ask Sinclair when the revolutionary dream ended for him. He answers without hesitation. &quot;Early 1975. That&apos;s when the movement folded. President Nixon was removed from office, the Vietnam war ended, and it seemed everybody went back to their day jobs. I didn&apos;t have a day job and I didn&apos;t want one, so I became a poet and a community activist again.&quot; Does he miss those times? He pauses for a good while. &quot;I never think of it that way. What good would it do? They sure as hell ain&apos;t coming back. I live in the present, and who can tell what will happen in the future? All I know is that if you want things to change, you have to work to make them change. And sometimes, you have to be prepared to go to jail or have your head cracked open. Far as I can see, that&apos;s still the case. Look at Pussy Riot. They are the first kick-ass revolutionary group since the MC5. They don&apos;t want a record contract, they don&apos;t want their own fragrance, they want to overthrow the goddam Russian government. Yes!&quot; He clenches his fist and raises it in the air, then falls back in to his chair, grinning. &quot;Those girls don&apos;t give a shit,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s what being a revolutionary is really all about.&quot; Mohawk is released on 24 March on Iron Man Records.

That is, until a bus driver ran a red light, turned right, and drove straight into Ann-Doerthe Hass Jensen. The bus knocked the social worker off her bike, trapping her underneath, a wheel pinning down and crushing her left foot. It was a school bus heading to a Copenhagen kindergarten, and the children aboard were screaming. Ann was rushed to hospital in excruciating pain, every bone in her foot shattered. In the six weeks of hospitalisation that followed, part of Ann&apos;s foot was amputated. Salvageable bones were wired back into place and skin grafts were taken from her thigh to replace the torn and missing flesh. &quot;I&apos;m pretty lucky,&quot; says Ann. &quot;People normally die when this happens.&quot; It was a year before she could walk again. During that year, she had to take a taxi to work every day. &quot;I hated it,&quot; she says. &quot;Here, the taxi drivers are a menace, and I was really scared of accidents.&quot; She also hated having to wait. Travelling by bike in Copenhagen is often the fastest way to get around, which is the top reason that Copenhageners cycle. Ann&apos;s physiotherapy was tricky. The missing portion of her foot is a crucial stepping point, and its absence affects her balance. But walking wasn&apos;t the only part of her rehabilitation. In Copenhagen \u2013 where people own 5.2 bicycles for every car \u2013 over a third of residents pedal to work, school or college. So rehabilitation often literally means getting you back in the saddle. The city helped Ann get a specially adapted Nihola cycle: a sturdy, stable threewheeler that has allowed her to regain independent mobility. In cities across the world, researchers, planners and policymakers are examining the many potential plus points of cycling. Increasing the proportion of people who cycle or walk, rather than drive, could not only reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, but also lower people&apos;s risk of developing a number of diseases. But at what cost? To what extent does cycling in cities expose you to the risk of injury or death? What makes some cities so much safer and attractive for cyclists than others? The drastically different design and policy approaches taken by large cities in Europe and North America provide some stark comparisons on cycling safety, equity and its impact on public health. To weigh up the risks and benefits of city cycling, and explore what can be learned where public health, urban design and transport engineering meet, I did what I had to do: I hopped on a bike. Paris has become accustomed to bicycles  In Paris, new bike lanes are pervasive. Though many of the streets are centuries old, sometimes cobbled, and claustrophobically narrow, bike lanes have been prominently marked. There are also some segregated cycle paths, often crazily disconnected \u2013 disappearing and appearing again in a seemingly random fashion. Skinny one-way streets might have bike lanes on the right, so you cycle with the direction of the traffic, or on the left, so you&apos;re in the contraflow. On some major streets, like Boulevard Saint-Michel, there are special lanes shared by bikes and buses. Though I felt less squeezed cycling in these wide lanes, where traffic was much lighter than the adjacent lanes for cars, I did feel a little intimidated about sharing the lane with buses. That said, the Parisian bus drivers gave me plenty of space, and didn&apos;t behave aggressively. I did get a sense that traffic here has become accustomed to bicycles. There are some off-street cycle paths too. Zooming alongside the Seine on the elevated bike path, totally segregated from motorised traffic, was pure delight. V\u00e9lib bikes, from Paris&apos;s bicycle sharing system, were in use everywhere. I saw men in suits, teenagers, women in chic business attire, pensioners, and female university students riding side by side on the bikes. Posting celebrity V\u00e9lib&apos; sightings on social media has apparently become something of a local pastime. The bikes are such a fixture that I saw one young man taking a break on a parked V\u00e9lib&apos;, feet on the handlebars, chatting on his mobile phone.     Cyclists cross a bridge in Copenhagen; usually touted as the most cycle-friendly city in the world. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images    In the midst of Paris&apos;s cycling revolution, it seemed fitting to meet Ari Rabl at Le Procope, a city restaurant where some of the leaders of the French Revolution gathered. With Audrey de Nazelle, a lecturer at the centre for environmental policy at Imperial College London, Rabl, a consultant and retired scientist at the centre energ\u00e9tique et proc\u00e9d\u00e9s of the \u00c9cole des Mines in Paris, has looked at the health benefits when people move from cars to walking or cycling. Rabl explains that they found that the population-level costs due to fatal accidents are outweighed at least tenfold by the health benefits of walking or cycling. Monetising the costs and benefits, Rabl and De Nazelle estimated that for a driver who switches from driving to cycling for their 5km commute, the overall health benefit from physical activity is worth about \u20ac1,300 (\u00a31,070) per year. Of course, it&apos;s important to point out that while fatal accidents might be reported as small &quot;population-level costs&quot; in public health studies, they have tragic, catastrophic costs for individuals and their loved ones. Many Danes don&apos;t even consider cycling exercise  Four days earlier, and some 1,000 or so kilometres north-east, I&apos;m sitting in a conference room at the University of Copenhagen&apos;s department of public health, overlooking the picturesque Lakes area. Around the table are health researchers Astrid Ledgaard Holm, Henning Langberg and Henrik Br\u00f8nnum-Hansen. Ledgaard Holm, a doctoral student, has modelled the health impacts of increased cycling. Accounting for physical activity, exposure to accidents and air pollution, she and colleagues found that the overall burden of disease \u2013 including heart disease, stroke, type II diabetes, breast cancer, colon cancer, cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer \u2013 was reduced in people who cycled. The positive health effects of increased cycling were more than a third larger than the potential loss of health from bicycle accidents and air pollution. Other studies investigating the health impacts of cycling have found similar positive benefits, although the magnitude varies. In a different study based in Copenhagen, researchers analysed data from over 13,000 women and 17,000 men to explore the impact of physical activity on mortality. Even after adjusting for other factors, such as physical activity in leisure time, they found that people who did not cycle to work experienced a 39% higher mortality rate than those who did. In other words, cycling improved longevity. One of the most interesting insights the Danish researchers share is how they&apos;ve discovered that many Danes don&apos;t consider cycling exercise. &quot;People here can easily be riding back and forth 5 km per day, and if you ask them on a questionnaire if they are physically active, they will say &apos;No, I don&apos;t do any exercise&apos;,&quot; says Ledgaard Holm. For many here, she says, it&apos;s not a choice of activity, but your mode of transport. What&apos;s immediately striking about cycling in Copenhagen is the incredible diversity of individuals on bicycles. Embedding myself in the morning rush-hour traffic on N\u00f8rrebrogade, one of Copenhagen&apos;s busiest cycle routes, I see a woman in a long flowing black jilbab pedalling a cargo bike with two small children in the basket. I see men of all ages in suits; women in dresses, high-heeled boots and smart coats, flowing garments protected from the spokes by metal skirt guards on the wheel hub. I see university students and children cycling to school; toddlers strapped into child seats on the front or back of mum or dad&apos;s bike; and baskets of children pedalled along in sturdy Christiana or streamlined Bullit bikes. Some children ride the cycle paths independently. Others are shepherded by parents cycling alongside, who guide their charges with the occasional gentle hand on the back. While cycling to interviews at the University of Copenhagen one morning, I happen upon a makeshift memorial on the side of the street. At the intersection of Store Kongensgade and Dronningens Tv\u00e6rgade in the city centre, a stretch of tarmac the length of a body is adorned with fresh flowers and candle jars inscribed with handwritten notes. I discover later that it&apos;s where a 20-year-old woman on her bike was struck and killed several weeks earlier by a tourist bus making a right-hand turn. Decades after streets were first painted with white crosses to mark fallen cyclists, cycling accidents, although rare, are still not taken lightly here. Only one Copenhagen cyclist was killed in 2012, and no year from 1998 to 2012 has seen more than seven cyclists killed in the city, according to Statistics Denmark. These figures are quite something in a city where the population cycles an estimated 1.27m km every day. The risk associated with being a cyclist in Copenhagen &quot;has dropped by more than 70% over the last 15 years&quot; according to Niels Torslov, the city&apos;s traffic director. &quot;And it&apos;s a very strong story about finding the right measures, and designing a road space in a way that protects the users, especially those cycling.&quot; The use of cycling helmets is growing among Copenhageners, noticeably more than in Amsterdam, where helmet wearing is still very much an exception. At the time of her accident, in 2006, Ann-Doerthe Hass Jensen was wearing a helmet, though clearly, as she says herself, a helmet protects your head but not your feet. She says that working at Copenhagen&apos;s Centre for Rehabilitation of Brain Injury, as she does, makes you fanatical about helmets. &quot;There is no way I would not have a helmet on,&quot; she says. After several days of exploring Copenhagen by bike, I meet Ann at the centre, where she leads me outside to see her specially adapted tricycle. Her sense of pride is palpable. It takes her between 30 \u2013 40 minutes to make the trip from home to work. &quot;The first few times I got back on a bike again, it was hard. Really, really hard,&quot; she says. &quot;There was a lot of crying.&quot; Now, though, there is no stopping her. In her first year of recovery, Ann&apos;s rehabilitation team felt she needed to re-establish both the freedom of mobility and the quality of life that her bicycle had previously allowed. It wasn&apos;t easy. Beyond the physical challenges of getting Ann back in the saddle, there was another hurdle: her enormous fear. &quot;I had to work with a psychologist \u2026 because I was scared like hell,&quot; she says. Using cognitive therapy, she and her psychologist worked through the entire experience, going over the incident report in excruciating detail. Pushing through that fear was tough. &quot;It wasn&apos;t my perception that was off that day. It was somebody who actually did something wrong. And it took me a while to get my confidence again,&quot; she says. Ann&apos;s fear was not unreasonable. Her experience wasn&apos;t just an accident. It was the action of a negligent driver, whose licence was revoked when the case came to court two years later. Of all the cities, London was the most terrifying Research shows that perceived safety is at least as critical as measured safety to the willingness of citizens to hop on a bike. For me, of all the cities I cycled in, London was the most terrifying. Cyclists were prevalent in the centre of the city, and what immediately struck me, beyond the dense, fast-moving traffic they were attempting to navigate, was the rapid speed they were cycling at. In impromptu interviews with cyclists stopped at traffic lights, I asked one woman why she cycled. Her answer: &quot;I hate the tube, it&apos;s really unhealthy and sweaty and overcrowded.&quot; Asked if she felt safe cycling, she said, &quot;No. That&apos;s the honest answer.&quot; But her sentiments weren&apos;t shared by everyone I asked. A student who had just moved to London said, &quot;It&apos;s about five to 10 years ahead of New York,&quot; adding that she felt quite safe cycling on London&apos;s cycle superhighways.     A cyclist is seen in the mirror of a scooter in Amsterdam. People in Amsterdam own an estimated 881,000 bicycles. Photograph: Timothy Clary/AFP/Getty Images    I, on the other hand, did not. I spent some time watching cyclists crossing the Southwark bridge section of one of the cycle superhighways. Riding along CS7&apos;s blue-painted bike lane on a &quot;Boris bike (Mayor Boris Johnson&apos;s cycle hire scheme was introduced in 2010) largely unseparated from mixed, fast-moving traffic, made me anxious and uneasy. What&apos;s more, I suffer from asthma, making me a bit of a human canary for air pollution. After the noticeably clean air of Copenhagen, the polluted air of London made for laboured breathing. London is beginning to make progress on provisions for cyclists, and there are good sections of the growing infrastructure, but I saw plenty of room for improvement. On both sides of Southwark bridge, the short, separated span of blue bike lane, protected by a concrete barrier, fed straight into a bus stop. This forced cyclists to choose between two unappealing options: wait like a sitting duck behind the bus while it stops, or pull out into traffic to overtake, and risk being in one of the bus&apos;s many blind spots when it pulls out from the kerb. Peter Wright is the delivery planner for cycling at Transport for London (TfL), the local government body chaired by Johnson. Wright explains that bus-stop bypasses are planned, &quot;to try and avoid conflict so that cyclists don&apos;t have to come out into general traffic&quot;. A similar hazard was delivery vehicles parked in bike lanes, a common sight in London and Paris. In November 2013, when asked about the spate of cycling deaths, Johnson told the Guardian that if cyclists did not follow the rules, &quot;there&apos;s no amount of traffic engineering that we invest in that is going to save people&apos;s lives.&quot; To be fair, London&apos;s Mayor \u2013 a cyclist himself \u2013 is making gradual progress. In 2013, TfL announced its safe streets for London plan, which aims to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured by 40% by 2020. Ben Plowden from TfL surface transport said: &quot;In 2015, we will be spending \u00a3145m a year on cycling, or roughly \u00a318 a head, up with the best in Germany and almost on a par with the Netherlands. This represents around 2% of TfL&apos;s overall expenditure and is roughly proportionate to the current 2% mode share of cycling.&quot; He added that cycle spending would total \u00a3913m during the next 10 years, more than treble previously planned levels. Safety in absence? It is not completely clear how and why accident rates change as the number of cyclists varies, but a safety in numbers effect seems to occur: safety improves in a city as the total number of cyclists increases. This effect has been seen in studies in Denmark, the Netherlands, 14 other European countries, Australia and 68 cities in California. &quot;It is likely that causation runs in both directions: safer cycling encourages more cycling, and more cycling encourages greater safety,&quot; writes John Pucher, professor of urban Planning at Rutgers University, New Jersey, in his recent book City Cycling. Motorist behaviour probably contributes to this phenomenon. In places like Copenhagen \u2013 where four out of five individuals have access to a bicycle \u2013 most drivers are also cyclists, and so are accustomed to sharing public space with bicycles. It can be difficult to compare safety between cities because of the lack of consistency in data collection and because of the need to frame injuries and deaths within the context of exposure \u2013 the overall numbers of trips, total distance or time spent cycling. Under-reporting of cycling crashes is also a well-documented problem. Nevertheless, Pucher&apos;s 2012 book written with Ralph Buehler listed figures for annual fatalities per 10,000 daily cyclists: Copenhagen 0.3, Amsterdam 0.4, Vancouver 0.9, Toronto 1.3, Portland 1.9, Montr\u00e9al 2.0, Paris 0.8, London 1.1 and New York 3.8 (all 2010 except Paris, London and New York, 2009). Unless you are travelling at breakneck speed, though, there is nothing inherently dangerous about cycling \u2013 it&apos;s the environment you&apos;re in that creates danger. Ian Roberts, a professor at the nutrition and public health intervention research unit at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, began his career as a paediatric trauma doctor. &quot;I saw lots of children hit by cars,&quot; he says, &quot;and it really is awful.&quot; He describes these deaths as &quot;kinetic energy disease&quot; \u2013 a reference to the idea of mismatched masses in motion. When one of those masses is protected by metal casing, but the other isn&apos;t, it&apos;s clear who is more likely to be hurt. One of the trends Roberts has puzzled over is the long-term decline in the death rates of British pedestrians, despite an increase in motorisation. &quot;Road safety people would point to it as an example of how roads are getting safer. But I was a little bit sceptical \u2026 because [the] volume of kinetic energy on the road was going up.&quot; An alternative hypothesis was that in industrialised countries, there were fewer people walking, something investigated in research he conducted while working in New Zealand. &quot;Over the years it became obvious that people were walking and cycling less than ever before in the history of humans on the planet,&quot; says Roberts. &quot;The world was not getting safer, it was getting more hostile, and people were voting with their feet by getting out of the way.&quot; The bicycle-as-vehicle philosophy  In North America in the 1970s, cyclists \u2013 or at least the most vocal advocacy groups purporting to represent them \u2013 did not want to get out of the way. So-called vehicular cycling was emerging, a philosophy that has influenced transport policy in both North America and Britain. Fathered by the Californian industrial engineer and cycling activist John Forester, vehicular cycling encourages cyclists to travel on the road in mixed traffic. On his website, Forester writes: &quot;Vehicular cycling, so named because you are acting as the driver of a vehicle, just as the traffic laws require, is faster and more enjoyable, so that the plain joy of cycling overrides the annoyance of even heavy traffic.&quot;     Cyclists on Velib hire-bikes in Paris. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian     In 1970s California, lots of athletic cyclists were forming touring groups for riding fast on roads, explains Anne Lusk, a research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health. Back then, she says, such groups may have legitimately feared that US adoption of Dutch-style cycle paths would restrict bike access to roads. &quot;At the time, paths were becoming crowded by joggers, walkers, inline skaters and baby-carriage pushers,&quot; says Lusk, so cycling advocates fought forcefully against proposals for cycle paths. The vehicular cycling philosophy became incorporated into US guidelines for transport design, and its influence was felt for decades, limiting the building of physically separated cycle tracks and putting cyclists on the road with cars. &quot;It&apos;s something that really stuck in North America,&quot; says Meghan Winters, assistant professor in the faculty of health sciences at Simon Fraser University, Canada. Asked if the philosophy of vehicular cycling is evidence-based, she says no. &quot;But it&apos;s something that was sticky and was adopted very broadly for very, very many years,&quot; she adds. Forester&apos;s teachings included how to operate as a motor vehicle, with skills like not riding in the door zone (the area next to a parked car where an opened door could hit a moving cyclist). They were useful, says Lusk, in that they did teach people how to bike with cars if they had to. But she does not endorse Forester&apos;s view that there should be no cycle lanes painted on the road, no separate cycle tracks and no cycle symbols. Lusk, and other researchers who have studied the particular needs of certain groups of cyclists \u2013 such as women, children, elderly people and parents transporting children \u2013 point out that many of these riders cannot operate as a vehicle as confidently as, say, a fit young man on a racing or touring bike. Utilitarian cycling, with bike-specific transport infrastructure, is about being inclusive, addressing the needs of cyclists young and old, male and female. The need for speed is not universal among cyclists, nor is feeling comfortable cycling in heavy, motorised traffic. It&apos;s precisely the recognition that cyclists come in all shapes and sizes, and with all kinds of needs, that has driven the last several decades of cycling infrastructure and policy in Denmark and the Netherlands. Tom Godefrooij of the Dutch Cycling Embassy writes: &quot;Cycling is too important as a mode of transport to leave it only to the daring helmeted cycle warriors in conspicuous jackets. Cycling should not be elitist, but for all.&quot; How northern Europe shunned the car  Outside Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport, I see a worker giving his colleague a lift to a plane on the back of his bike, an example of just how deeply embedded cycling is in Dutch culture. A bicycle is by far the best and quickest way to get around Amsterdam, local journalist Bennie Mols tells me. One new hazard he laments is tourists on bikes, who lack the understanding of how and where to ride. His description stirs a guilty pang. I learn quickly (but too late) that the hand signal for stop is essential in busy bike traffic. Failing to use it as I slow down to navigate, I cause a near-collision as a herd of bicycles behind me screeches to a halt, one woman yelling &quot;seriously?&quot; at me multiple times as she skids to a stop on the grassy verge. Wishing I could dissolve into the bike path, I sheepishly review the hand signals in my guidebook. It&apos;s a mistake I don&apos;t make again. Amsterdam and Copenhagen weren&apos;t always the cycle-friendly cities they are today. In the Netherlands, as car-buying wealth grew in the postwar era, cycling rates dropped precipitously from about 85% of all trips in the 1950s to about 20% in the early 1970s. As the numbers of cyclists fell, discontent grew over the increasing numbers of cyclists and pedestrians killed in traffic accidents. A journalist whose daughter had been killed in traffic launched the &apos;Stop Kindermoord&apos; (stop the child murder) movement. There were widespread street protests.     A cyclist weaves through traffic in London. The city was found to be the 'most terrifying' of the places sampled. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian     Danish transport policy reached a tipping point in the 1970s and 1980s, when the nation veered away from urban planning dominated by provisions for motorised vehicles, towards the establishment of cycling-specific infrastructure and traffic calming. As Stop Kindermoord emerged in the Netherlands, a corresponding movement grew in Denmark. The public rose up against a proposal to build a major motorway alongside a picturesque area of Copenhagen known as the Lakes. Massive demonstrations ensued. It was during this era that protesters began painting white crosses on the streets where cyclists had been killed in traffic. So while most other developed nations continued through the 1980s and beyond with road transport design that prioritised the needs of motorised vehicles, a dramatic change was taking place in northern Europe. The shift in thinking catalysed by public protest was that, rather than requiring children and cyclists to adapt to motorised traffic, traffic should adapt to children and cyclists. Northern Europe&apos;s shift towards a safer, more convenient infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians created an unplanned natural experiment \u2013 albeit one fraught with uncontrolled variables including car taxes, climate, topography, political differences and dependence on the car industry for employment. Nevertheless, in cities orientated towards motor vehicles, the limited provision of transport routes that safely accommodate bikes and a default assumption that riders will adopt vehicular cycling have resulted in stagnantly low numbers of (mostly male) cyclists, for the best part of three decades. &quot;There are dramatic differences in terms of cycling rates and cycling safety between those two places [northern Europe and North America],&quot; says Meghan Winters. &quot;So I think the evidence clearly illustrates which one of these strategies is effective if your goal is to get large segments of the population cycling, and cycling safely \u2026 In a sense, this is a global experiment on that, and I think North America may be coming around now,&quot; she says. Perhaps. But there&apos;s a long road ahead. Montr\u00e9al is the most cycle-friendly Canadian city  It&apos;s the summer of 2013, and Toronto traffic is a mess. In the midst of major street reconstruction and resurfacing, traffic queues bumper to bumper heading south on Bay Street, near City Hall. There are a few demarcated bike lanes, and only one separated bike path (not including completely off-street routes such as the largely recreational path along the lakeshore). Taxis weave in and out of lanes, sometimes coming very close to the kerb \u2013 the space shared with bicycles. It feels like a hostile environment for cyclists, and I do not sense much tolerance of bikes from motorists. One of the cyclists I speak to in an impromptu interview says that it&apos;s pedestrians rather than vehicles that he worries about most. Other hazards for Toronto cyclists include streetcars. Their tracks, which can trap a bicycle wheel if crossed in parallel, are particularly nervewracking. Toronto is not an unfamiliar city to me \u2013 I lived here for more than a decade \u2013 but returning to cycle downtown is not a pleasant experience. In Vancouver, however, there&apos;s a shift in transportation thinking. I note a growing number of bike lanes, segregated bike paths, and painted bike boxes at junctions, which give cyclists a safe place to await a green light and turn safely, ahead of motorists. Though recreational cycling in places like Stanley Park has been possible for decades, it&apos;s cycling as transportation that is the focus of the Vancouver city council and mayor Gregor Robertson, who cycles to work. Some of the new separated bike paths feel very safe and easy to use. But there are still places where lanes end in a fairly hazardous way, such as one junction where the bike lane ends abruptly only to reappear a few metres later in the middle of two lanes of car traffic. Cycling along Dunsmuir and over the bridge viaduct on the fully segregated bike lane feels incredibly liberating. Perhaps I&apos;m pushing my luck riding a bike around downtown Vancouver on Friday the 13th, but where the bike routes are marked, or traffic is calmed, I feel relatively safe. The science of urban cycling is messy, but the case for separated bike lanes combined with traffic-calming measures (to reduce vehicle speed) is mounting. A 2009 paper that examined findings from 23 studies from across the world suggested that &quot;purpose-built bicycle-specific facilities reduce crashes and injuries among cyclists&quot;. Recent research in Vancouver and Toronto by a collaboration of 14 researchers, including Winters, found that &quot;at local street intersections, traditional stops are safer than traffic circles [roundabouts], and at non-intersections, cycle tracks alongside major streets and traffic diversion from local streets are safer than no bicycle infrastructure&quot;. Many more studies are forthcoming from the Canadian Cycling in Cities research group. Montr\u00e9al is the most cycle-friendly Canadian city I visit. Even where bike lanes are not explicitly marked, motorists are generally patient and considerate in terms of sharing space with cyclists. Though definitely more hilly than Amsterdam and Copenhagen, the undulating topography doesn&apos;t seem to be an impediment to Montr\u00e9alers.     People on bicycles in the Plateau area of Montreal, the best Canadian city to cycle in. Photograph: Megapress/Alamy     Montr\u00e9al means &apos;Mount Royal&apos;, referring to the steep \u2013 if not entirely mountainous \u2013 hill and park near the centre of town. The Plateau area, an uphill climb from the city centre, is one of the most heavily cycled parts of the city. It hosts the city&apos;s oldest major bike path, along Rue de Br\u00e9beuf, a route that spans the entire island of Montr\u00e9al. During morning rush hour, I see a steady stream of bikes along Boulevard de Maisonneuve, one of several bidirectional, fully segregated bike paths with bike-specific traffic lights. Bikes are also allowed in Montr\u00e9al&apos;s parks, many of which have trails for recreational or commuting use. It was in Montr\u00e9al, the only large North American city to have cycling infrastructure dating back to the 1980s, that Anne Lusk and colleagues tested the safety of separated cycling infrastructure versus road cycling. They found that separated cycle tracks have lower crash and injury rates (or at least no higher) than the street, and have seen a similar trend in the USA. And research by Winters and colleagues adds to the evidence, finding that bicycle-specific infrastructure that reduces interactions between cyclists and motor vehicles can reduce the occurrence of injuries, potentially by more than 50%. Summary  So, how do we make our cities better for cyclists? Safe-cycling cities, policies and legislation already exist, and can inspire others. In Oregon, Portland&apos;s vulnerable user law, for example, is modelled on a European safety concept, says lawyer Ray Thomas, a partner at Swanson, Thomas, Coon and Newton \u2013 who specialises in cycling law. In Copenhagen, in one of many chance interviews with cyclists on city streets, I happen upon a young American student \u2013 Mike Milan, from Greenville, South Carolina \u2013 who is studying architecture there. &quot;As I&apos;ve learned in my urban design class here, Copenhagen has tried to slow down the city to a human pace, and a human scale,&quot; he says. His thoughts conceptually crystallise the city&apos;s transport philosophy, and are equally applicable to Amsterdam.  &quot;Making people feel safer on bikes should not mean equipping them with high-vis and reflective helmets,&quot; says Jack Harris, owner of London&apos;s Tally Ho! Cycle Tours. &quot;We need infrastructure that allows a broader cross-section of society to get onto a bike.&quot; The places that are serious about encouraging cycling as a safe, accessible and pleasant mode of transport have some tough decisions to make about vulnerable users, including cyclists, in the allocation of urban space. At the Copenhagen rehabilitation centre where Ann-Doerthe Hass Jensen works, her physiotherapist colleague Daniel Thue Bech-Pedersen says: &quot;Our main goal of rehabilitation is to allow any individual to be more active again.&quot; This can mean being active for work, for leisure, for getting yourself around. &quot;When you can transport yourself and make sure you lower your risk of having another stroke or whatever,&quot; he says, &quot;then one plus one equals three.&quot;  Ann suffers chronic pain from her foot, wears special orthopaedic shoes and walks with a cane, so getting back to cycling made a massive difference to her mobility. It also gave her back her independence. On her cargo trike, she can take her two-year-old niece out on excursions, something that would be impossible on foot or by bus.  Asked how she feels at this point along her recovery and about riding to work each day, she replies without hesitation: &quot;I love it.&quot; Her tricycle has given her much more than just a means of getting about. Being mobile means being independent, but even more, it means being free.

It&apos;s an almost inconceivable dilemma, but one day we could be offered a choice between having children and enhancing our chances of reaching a grand old age. The idea that fertility and longevity may be intertwined was first mooted in the 1970s when gerontologist Tom Kirkwood, now at the University of Newcastle, proposed his &quot;disposable soma&quot; hypothesis. Over time, our bodies age as a result of natural degeneration or &quot;wear and tear&quot;, and Kirkwood suggested that they have a limited energy budget that can either be used to repair damaged cells and halt this decline, or saved to allow us to reproduce. Thirty years on and advances in genomic techniques have enabled scientists to pinpoint one of the key molecular pathways involved in the ageing process, controlled by a hormone known as IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1). The link between this particular hormone and longevity was uncovered almost by chance, while biologists were studying the behaviour of a species of worm known as Caenorhabditis elegans. Worms have a special mechanism that kicks in when they&apos;re exposed to severe environmental stress: their levels of IGF-1 drop, putting them into a state of hibernation during which they&apos;re unable to procreate. But, crucially, they stay alive. In all mammals, including humans, IGF-1 is believed to initiate a chain of events that controls the way energy is used. There are genes involved that stimulate proteins to begin vital processes such as the repair of damaged cells, which can have a big impact when it comes to postponing the onset of cancer, for example. However, the type of processes that are initiated depends on the levels of IGF-1, with low levels sending the body into a self-preservation mode, switching energy allocation away from the reproductive organs and devoting resources to maintenance and DNA repair. Having low levels of IGF-1 can make a big difference when it comes to avoiding some of the most common degenerative illnesses in later life, and we&apos;re now getting some fresh insights into how this might work for Alzheimer&apos;s disease. This month, psychiatrists from the VU University of Amsterdam report their investigation into the link between IGF-1 and this form of dementia. They found that high levels of IGF-1 in the blood of middle-aged people was associated with a high genetic risk of getting Alzheimer&apos;s \u2013 the first time such a link has been found in humans. They believe that reduced activity of the hormone prevents the disease from developing. &quot;Alzheimer&apos;s disease in late life is probably driven strongly by spontaneous low-grade inflammation in the brain,&quot; explains longevity researcher Maarten Rozing from Leiden University in the Netherlands, who wasn&apos;t involved in the research. &quot;So low IGF-1 activity would mean far more molecular activity being devoted to repairing damaged tissue, which can halt the inflammation and prevent it from spreading.&quot; There is more evidence linking low IGF-1 activity and healthy ageing. A recent study looking at centenarians in the Ashkenazi Jewish population of New England found an intriguing genetic link: they were more likely than the general population to carry mutations that reduced the activity of IGF-1. However, far from being a matter of genetic fate, it may actually be possible to proactively influence the level of IGF-1 in our bodies, since it is related at least partly to diet. Some researchers believe that low-calorie or even low-protein diets can be beneficial, and calorie restriction experiments with mice, starting from birth, have yielded positive results in terms of survival benefits. &quot;You see the mice living up to 40% longer and [they] are much healthier,&quot; Rozing said. &quot;However, it&apos;s a little more difficult to examine this in humans, simply because they live so long! But some experiments have shown that calorie restriction can lead to metabolic benefits \u2013 such as low chlolesterol and lower blood pressure.&quot; The downside is that while low IGF-1 appears to improve your chances of health ageing, it may also have a drastic effect on your ability to reproduce, especially for females. Genetic experiments in fruit flies in which IGF-1 production is knocked out altogether result in a big increase in lifespan, but also render the insects infertile. This could prove to be a defining conundrum for future generations of humans. Our natural instinct is not only to reproduce but also prolong our survival for as long as possible, but can we have both? Researchers from the Institute of Experimental Genetics in Germany and the National Research Centre for Growth and Development in New Zealand, have been looking at ways of manipulating the cascade of processes controlled by IGF-1 \u2013without the need for extreme calorie restriction. One method involves a substance called resveratrol, which is found in red wine and affects energy metabolism. However, just as was predicted by Tom Kirkwood 40 years ago, the evidence suggests that such tinkering leads to a trade-off between longevity and reproduction, reducing fertility.

Pim is Pim Fortuyn, the far-right Dutch politician assassinated in 2002 after claiming that &quot;the Netherlands is full&quot;. Theo is the provocative Dutch artist and film-maker Theo van Gogh, who was murdered in Amsterdam two years later over a short film that featured naked women painted with passages from the Koran. Rosie and Jim, they are not. Putting the pair onstage is a big risk \u2013 particularly in front of a teenage audience. Alex Byrne, artistic director of the anglo-European devised theatre company New International Encounter, is keenly aware of that. &quot;The more I explored the subject,&quot; he says, &quot;the less I knew what I thought about it.&quot; That&apos;s exactly what drives his work: &quot;If I already know, then what&apos;s the point in doing it? You go on stage to find out with an audience what something might mean.&quot; Fortuyn and van Gogh were both vehemently outspoken public figures \u2013 as controversial as they were contradictory. &quot;It&apos;s very easy to sympathise with Theo van Gogh,&quot; says Byrne. &quot;He&apos;s an artist. He stood up for freedom of expression and the right to offend people. He offended a lot of people, did some very foolish things and was murdered in public, in a very brutal way.            &quot;On the other hand, Pim Fortuyn was, in many ways, a very unappealing man: potentially racist with a particular anti-immigration agenda, but he was also very erudite and charming with this strange dichotomy of being both very rightwing and also very openly gay and promiscuous.&quot; In NIE&apos;s piece, the two men are almost bound together in death, like two Beckett characters forced to rely on and infuriate each other for all eternity. &quot;Pim Fortuyn, who was shot in the head, can&apos;t remember what happened to him,&quot; Byrne explains. &quot;Theo van Gogh, who had a discourse with his killer before an explanation was pinned to his chest with a steak knife, can&apos;t forget.&quot; Both walk around with their fatal injuries on show: an indignity that makes them simultaneously clownish and unsettling. The dilemma the two men stand for is this: Does liberalism have its limits or must tolerance extend to include the intolerant? Fortuyn and Van Gogh both said no and, in doing so, spoke out against more absolutist understandings of Islam. In that, their lives (and deaths) beg another apparent paradox: Does freedom of speech encompass the right to offend? At one point, Van Gogh gives Fortuyn free rein to take the stage and say his piece. &quot;I wanted to put some of the things that Pim Fortuyn says onstage,&quot; Byrne continues. &quot;They&apos;re not necessarily rabidly racist statements, but they are racist.&quot; Fortuyn&apos;s speaking style was also oddly persuasive: not rabble-rousing, but subtle and self-deprecating. That combination makes the show all the more troubling and the company has already been accused by one Austrian teacher of giving Fortuyn&apos;s views an unwarranted platform. But Byrne trusts his audience \u2013 young as they are \u2013 to decide for themselves. &quot;In political oratory, you can find yourself listening to argument and you sort of go, &apos;OK, I kind of align myself with that&apos;. Then, &apos;Hang on, I see where this is going. No I don&apos;t.&apos;&quot; In some ways, Pim and Theo allows that young audience a safe space to encounter &quot;the politics of the right and of racial identity that can,&quot; Byrne believes, &quot;be beguiling.&quot; He points to Nigel Farage&apos;s charm, such as it is, as being based in mischievous humour and &quot;a wink&quot; that somehow makes politics human. Fortuyn did something similar by reflecting people&apos;s actual concerns, fracturing traditional distinctions between left- and rightwing politics. Pim and Theo leaves enough space for its audience to unpick those tangled values. It&apos;s almost forum theatre: at times questions hang in the air, seemingly awaiting an answer. Byrne never wanted to &quot;teach or preach a position&quot; and so much of the key factual and biographical information is built into the installation-like set, which audience members explore after the show. That&apos;s actually rather fitting. Teenagers \u2013 certainly British teenagers \u2013 are unlikely to be familiar with either Fortuyn and Van Gogh and, detached from context, both become abstracted. It cools the controversy around these men and allows us instead to think of local equivalents: Nick Griffin, Tommy Robinson, Godfrey Bloom. That makes the debate about freedom of speech and its limits particularly resonant. Byrne sees a conclusion in there: &quot;that we should celebrate our right to say whatever we want, but we don&apos;t always have to say it. That&apos;s from Theo van Gogh&apos;s father: he says, &apos;I totally believed in my son&apos;s right to say what he wants, but I sometimes wish he wouldn&apos;t feel compelled to do so straight away.&apos;&quot; Another parallel springs to mind in Britain, from the very public nature of their respective deaths. When we learn that van Gogh&apos;s killer tried to decapitate him, it&apos;s impossible not to think of Drummer Lee Rigby. NIE were rehearsing the show at the time of his murder. It shocked them, but didn&apos;t necessarily surprise them. &quot;We tend to believe that violence is much further from the surface than it really is,&quot; says Byrne. He points to violence \u2013 &quot;some of it in our name&quot; \u2013 happening overseas, though insists that it does not &quot;ameliorate or excuse&quot; Rigby&apos;s murderers. If there&apos;s a danger in Pim and Theo, it&apos;s that the piece doesn&apos;t represent either Fortuyn or Van Gogh&apos;s killers. Doing so leaves the two murders ambiguous. It risks making decisive action look more impactful than decisive speech and allowing those murders \u2013 both with specific motives \u2013 stand for anything and everything. &quot;I didn&apos;t feel we owed them any right to speak,&quot; says Byrne, recognising it as a &quot;glaring omission&quot; that he hopes will force spectators to consider the motivations and implications of that decision. It&apos;s a rare piece of theatre that trusts teenagers to that extent.", "sentences": ["Theo is the provocative Dutch artist and film-maker Theo van Gogh, who was murdered in Amsterdam two years later over a short film that featured naked women painted with passages from the Koran."], "title": "Pim and Theo: the kids' theatre show about zealots and murder", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/05/pim-and-theo-van-gogh-fortuyn-new-international-encounter-theatre", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Pim Fortuyn", "World news", "Religion"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-06T08:00:08Z", "article": "The road to this summer\u2019s World Cup in Brazil is a thoroughfare pockmarked with uncertainties.

One can state, without doubt, that it will be completed on time. As has become traditional, the game is being developed by EA Canada, and is an offshoot of the all-conquering FIFA series. But this year, there is a rather strange twist: despite the incredible commercial and critical success of FIFA 14 on the most recently released consoles, the World Cup title is exclusive to PS3 and Xbox 360.

Back fours are noticeably more compact, no longer offering oceans of space for wingers to cut into, and players both accelerate and decelerate with more verve than in previous outings. \u201cWe wanted players who reacted more explosively to your controller inputs,\u201d explains Prior.\u2028\u2028 Also reworked are penalties, which EA felt were too difficult for the casual players who make up 50% of the target audience for this particular game. Now they\u2019re harder to miss \u2013 stop the needle in the green part of the accuracy meter and you\u2019re guaranteed a shot on target \u2013 and more fun for the keeper, too. Each face button corresponds to an action that the netminder can trigger during the run-up: on PS3, Circle points towards a corner, Cross provides Grobbelaar-esque jelly legs, Triangle gets the keeper to wave his arms around, while Square seemingly has him pretending to hold a cape out for an imaginary bull. They\u2019re ultimately pointless, like taunts in a fighting game, but fun all the same.     The USA team lines up in one of the game's accurately modelled stadiums    It adds up to a much more action-packed, and therefore often frantic, experience than last year\u2019s Fifa 14 \u2013 whichever console you played it on. But while the gameplay can be described as arcade-esque, the trimmings surrounding what happens on the pitch are anything but. Prior\u2019s team has gone to the usual lengths to ensure that you really feel part of the summer\u2019s footy frenzy, with the game packing in all 203 teams from the qualifying stages, made up of 7,469 players \u2013 all of whom have their names in the game. \u201cWe got poor old Clive Tyldesley to sit in the studio and record every last one,\u201d reveals Prior. \u201cI felt for him when he got to Madagascar and Burkina Faso.\u201d\u2028\u2028 Matches take place at all 12 stadiums from this summer\u2019s World Cup, and a few other big ones are in there, too (Wembley, Amsterdam Arena, Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, Stadio Olimpico to name four), in case you wish to replay a team\u2019s entire qualifying campaign. Once dropped into a stadium for a match, you\u2019re treated to the customary shots of supporters partying both in the stands and, in a neat touch, at \u201dfan fests\u201c back in their country of origin. \u2028\u2028\u201cWe\u2019ve got those \u2018crowd at home\u2019 scenes for every team in the world, with fans watching and reacting accordingly,\u201d says Prior. \u201cFor the bigger sides they take place at unique landmarks: The Colosseum, Trafalgar Square, Brandenburg Gate, Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and so on.\u201d With one very noticeable exception, however. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t show the Eiffel Tower because that\u2019s architecturally licensed. The whole thing is a bit of a minefield. We had to pick and choose dependent on lawyers.\u201d\u2028\u2028 Talk radio Also adding to the tournament atmosphere are two talk shows which you can select to accompany your qualifying or finals campaigns in between matches. Andy Goldstein and Ian Darke front EA Sports Talk Radio (see what they\u2019ve done there?), while the Men In Blazers station features two Brits (one Liverpool fan, one Chelsea) who have made a name for themselves across the pond with caustic input to NBC\u2019s soccer coverage. Their inclusion is intended to work on two levels: by giving you instant feedback on recent results, and adding an extra dazzle of magic to the illusion that you\u2019re part of a national side playing in a major tournament.  I\u2019m surprised by how well this feature works. In my five hours with the game, I hear no repetition whatsoever from the talking heads. While playing a finals campaign as Brazil, there\u2019s a surprisingly in-depth preview of the game with Cameroon, followed by a humorous monologue from Darke on how to pronounce the Fluminese attacker Fred\u2019s name. Men In Blazers serve up similarly entertaining opinions, for instance selecting Manuel Neuer for their World Cup Ultimate Team on the basis of his ability to stop referees giving goals in World Cup knockout stages using his mind. FIFA games aren\u2019t exactly known for hilarity, so these shows are a very welcome change of tone from the brain-breaking Europop dirge found in EA\u2019s club football game year after year. \u2028\u2028 Ultimate exclusion On the subject of Ultimate Team, it\u2019s conspicuous by its absence given the manner in which the card-and-coin-collecting mode dominates modern Fifa titles. Again, Prior has a clear explanation: \u201cWe looked at Ultimate Team and decided against including it. For one, 50% of our users are brand new to Fifa, and FUT is a more hardcore mode. Secondly, it\u2019s a hell of a lot of work and committing resources. Bringing the UI over would have meant having to sacrifice somewhere in the region of three other game modes. It\u2019s that big. Finally, the mechanic behind Ultimate Team is that it\u2019s a club football thing. It doesn\u2019t really gel with the core concept of what World Cup football is about.\u201d In fairness, those other modes on offer are plentiful. In addition to playing through the World Cup offline from day one of either Qualifying or the Finals, you get an online World Cup against up to 32 human players, Captain Your Country (steer one player \u2013 or, with mates, a collection of players \u2013 from semi-anonymity to Maracana glory), Story of Qualifying (replay or change the course of 60 real life scenarios) and more. \u2028\u2028Indeed, the most fun I have with the game is via Story of Qualifying, trying to replicate American Samoa\u2019s first ever win, a 2-0 triumph against Tonga.  And that, really, demonstrates the depth on offer here \u2013 while most casual players will stick with trying to win the World Cup with Brazil, Germany or (more fool them) Roy\u2019s \u201dpride\u201d of Lions, the dedicated should find equal enjoyment in a match between two nations from which they won\u2019t know a single player. It\u2019s of course a blow that this isn\u2019t bound for PS4 or Xbox One. But even so, EA\u2019s latest football offering promises a Yaya Toure-strong accompaniment to the greatest show on turf. \u2022 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil is released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 17 April. \u2022 Fifa 14 review", "sentences": ["\u201cI felt for him when he got to Madagascar and Burkina Faso.\u201d\u2028\u2028 Matches take place at all 12 stadiums from this summer\u2019s World Cup, and a few other big ones are in there, too (Wembley, Amsterdam Arena, Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, Stadio Olimpico to name four), in case you wish to replay a team\u2019s entire qualifying campaign."], "title": "Fifa World Cup Brazil video game preview \u2013 the greatest show on turf?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/06/fifa-world-cup-brazil-video-game-preview", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Fifa", "Sports games", "Xbox", "PS3"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-06T12:07:00Z", "article": "ALBER ELBAZ, LANVIN The permanent collection the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris, France. &quot;The Beaux-Arts de Paris, where we hold the Lanvin shows, is a very special place. It inspires me. The school, founded in the 17th century, owns one of the largest public collections of art in France. Its spirit of transmission, the idea of handing know-how from teacher to the next generation of artist over four centuries, moves me. Art galleries give a great insight to a city&apos;s culture.

April 2011     Ellsworth Kelly's Colors for a Large Wall, 1951    &quot;I find the space in galleries really inspiring. I go to the Met in New York about three times a year, and the Getty in LA, because I\u00a0love what the architecture has created. My dad came to Tate Modern with me a couple of years ago. We were in the line for the Edvard Munch exhibition, but he said that he&apos;d prefer to wander round the building and just buy the catalogue. These places where you can go for the art, or equally for a picnic, they&apos;re like community centres. Art is a real influence for Humberto [Leon] and me. When we joined Kenzo, an Ellsworth Kelly [top] show started\u00a0lots of thoughts for us. And Hockney at the Royal Academy \u2013 particularly his iPad drawings. They triggered inspiration and opened\u00a0conversations.&quot; GEOFFREY J FINCH, ANTIPODIUM Jeff Koons, Gagosian Gallery, New York, US. July 2013     Balloon Rabbit by Jeff Koons.

A close-up of a steel bolt and his well-used trouser pockets. Shot in black and white and rich with the authenticity of real life.

Hard work\u00a0and\u00a0careful order, repeated\u00a0over years, a feeling of dedication in people&apos;s houses. It gave me such a huge sense of the love and care that people have around one another, and the difference it makes.

April 2011      Untitled, a 2009 iPad drawing by David Hockney. Photograph: Fondation Pierre Berge-Yves Saint-Laurent/EPA    &quot;A few of years ago we were in Copenhagen and went to visit the David Hockney&apos;s Me Draw on Ipad exhibition [below] at the Louisiana Museum. We have always been big fans of Hockney&apos;s work and loved that he was enthusiastically embracing a new medium and that the work existed in a non-traditional way. The Louisiana is a\u00a0magical place in beautiful grounds on the edge of Denmark&apos;s sea, the \u00d8resund.&quot; ANTONIO BERARDI Facing the Modern: The Portrait in Vienna 1900, National Gallery, London, UK. November 2013 &quot;The Vienna exhibition contained works by Egon Schiele and Death And Life by Gustav Klimt, which was the first time it had been exhibited outside Austria \u2013 a real coup.     Richard Gerstl's Self-Portrait, laughing. Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images    &quot;The first thing I saw on entering the gallery was a piece entitled Self-Portrait Laughing [above] by a little-known Austrian painter and designer called Richard Gerstl. It\u00a0was one of the most inspiring and evocative pieces I have seen. Joyous in its colours and subject, sad because the young artist killed himself not long after. I left the exhibition after seeing this and returned a few days later to see the rest. After looking at such a powerful piece of art, the rest would have not had the same impact. It is a memory I carry with me always: unexpected, inspiring, optimistic, triste yet joyous all at the same time.&quot; VIVIENNE WESTWOOD The permanent collection at The Wallace Collection, London, UK     Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard's The Swing (1767), from The Wallace Collection    &quot;I visit the Wallace Collection in particular for the 17th-century painters like Titian and Vel\u00e1zquez. They have such wonderful things in there, but then you also have the three 18th-century geniuses: Boucher, Watteau and Fragonard [below]. All three say so much of that age \u2013 Boucher&apos;s pretty things; Watteau&apos;s work inspired by the Commedia dell&apos;arte. &quot;There are two fantastic Boucher as you come up the stairs \u2013 one is Apollo about to get into his chariot, surrounded by all the nymphs as he rises from the ocean. It&apos;s absolutely fantastic. Boucher is really sentimental, but you can&apos;t call him kitsch because he has such incredible facility. Playful but cynical somehow. He comes from an age that was very convenient for painters; all that mythology was part of a way of communicating in those days. &quot;To look at a painting is to enter a world. I love that 18th-century version of the pagan world. It&apos;s a delight. The only place to find ideas is by looking at what people did in the past. It&apos;s the way you can be original. Nothing comes from a vacuum; it is impossible to be creative unless you have a link with the past and tradition. You should constantly try to understand the world in which you live from the perspective of the way people saw things in the past. The art-lover is a freedom-fighter for a better world. Great\u00a0art aims at perfection and\u00a0is timeless; there is no progress in art.&quot; PETER JENSEN Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Copenhagen, Denmark, and the Hepworth Wakefield gallery, Wakefield, UK.     Spring 1966 by Barbara Hepworth at The Hepworth, Wakefield. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty/Hepworth Wakefield    &quot;There are two galleries I have a close bond with. The first is the Louisiana; it&apos;s just outside Copenhagen with a view overlooking the sea to Sweden and in the summer you can have a picnic in the garden looking at the sculptures. It truly is a great place with a lot of ground-breaking exhibitions and a permanent collection. It was the first museum in the world to show Andy Warhol&apos;s early drawings. &quot;The other place is the Hepworth museum in Wakefield. We did a collection for spring/summer 2013 that had Barbara Hepworth as the muse and we were asked to show this collection as an evening event in the museum. Truly, it was just amazing being around her work [below] and walking through a space that has been designed to fit this grand work by this little woman. I loved it and thought that what I\u00a0did was so small in comparison to this art.&quot; CHRISTOPHER SHANNON Centre of the Creative Universe: Liverpool and the Avant-Garde, Tate Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. February 2007     Rineke Dijkstra\u2019s Buzz club video installation    &quot;I saw Rineke Dijkstra&apos;s Buzz club video [above] at the Tate Liverpool a few years ago. It was exciting to see it projected so big in the city it was made in \u2013 I remember older kids at school going to the Buzz and being jealous. It&apos;s amazing that someone from outside the city caught that moment and the stills are so well known. She manages to observe and not imply judgment. I\u00a0love that about her work.&quot; ALICE TEMPERLEY The permanent collection at the Louvre, Paris, France.      Egpytian funerary figurines in the Louvre, Paris. Photograph: De Agostini/Getty    &quot;When I&apos;m in Paris I always walk up from the Place de la Concorde to the Louvre. I have a routine where I go to the cafe and sit and people-watch and then on to look at the ancient Egyptian jewellery and art [above]. Last time I went to see the Greek Agora sculptures, which were beautiful, but the room was so cold. Then I go to the bookshop before heading to the shops on Rue de Rivoli. It&apos;s a busy museum so you have to time it just right, either early or the last hour before it closes.&quot; JONATHAN SAUNDERS Sensation, Royal Academy, London, UK.

Two places that have recently inspired me are the Frieze art fair last October, where there&apos;s a huge amount of excitement and newness, and the V&amp;A Museum, which has everything to do with the past. I&apos;m obsessed with the Medieval &amp; Renaissance rooms [above] \u2013 they house European art and culture from 300 to 1600 and include Donatello sculptures, Henry VIII&apos;s furnishings and Leonardo da Vinci&apos;s notebooks.&quot;", "sentences": ["A still life at Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum has been playing on my mind since I\u00a0was there a month ago."], "title": "Fashion designers on their favourite artworks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/mar/06/vivienne-westwood-alber-elbaz-erdem-art-fashion", "tags": ["Art", "Vivienne Westwood", "Dolce & Gabbana", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Art and design", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-06T18:30:00Z", "article": "M\u00f8 sounds oddly like Jeremy Kyle. &quot;In Denmark we&apos;re so privileged,&quot; she says. &quot;You get money to study, you get money if you&apos;re sick and you get money if your hand hurts. It&apos;s hard to be critical of people who are sick getting money, but in Denmark everyone gets money thrown at them and it makes them lazy.&quot; What makes it so odd is that earlier she showed me her latest tattoo: a cartoon face clad in a balaclava, a tribute to the dissident Russian band Pussy Riot, and a reminder of 25-year-old Karen Marie \u00d8rsted&apos;s punk activist past in the duo Mor. Still, she presses on: &quot;They get so many lifestyle problems, such as depression, because there&apos;s nothing to fight for. It&apos;s better to have something to get up and live for. People don&apos;t know what to do with themselves \u2013 they get given every single opportunity in the world and can&apos;t make a decision.&quot; But then M\u00f8 isn&apos;t a punk activist any more. She&apos;s now a solo performer, being prepared to be a pop star. And her new sound, which reflects the continued influence of hip-hop on mainstream pop, combined with a dramatic, emotional voice similar to Lana Del Rey&apos;s, is a long way from Mor. These days she counts Beyonc\u00e9 and Justin Timberlake as labelmates, and not everyone from her former life was delighted with the change. &quot;Some people say: &apos;Urgh, major label,&apos; that sort of thing,&quot; she admits. M\u00f8 became politically active as a teenager after changing schools and becoming friends with a new group of kids who listened to the 80s US hardcore punk band Black Flag and were already engaged with politics \u2013 they would attend rallies, and she started to join them. &quot;I remember my first protest,&quot; she says. &quot;In Denmark we have a rightwing party called Dansk Folkeparti [Danish People&apos;s Party] and they had some very radical views about Islamic women, very racist things in my opinion. We staged a huge protest in a small town where they were holding their annual meeting. I was 16 and it was just so crazy.&quot; At 18, she formed Mor. &quot;Our music was very trashy and we toured a lot in Europe and New York,&quot; she says. &quot;Every week we&apos;d turn up at a new squat in the middle of nowhere and play. We got to meet so many interesting people. We were both activists, campaigning about things such as racism, fascism and women&apos;s rights.&quot;   M\u00d8 - Glass (Live) on MUZU.TV.   Reading on mobile? See M\u00d8 performing Glass here. So how does M\u00f8 square the punk past and the pop present? &quot;In my head I justify the pop thing with the fact that before I started listening to Black Flag, I fucking loved pop music. The Spice Girls [Sporty Spice was her favourite and still is], Cher, I loved them all. It was such a big thing for me. It makes sense to make a big song people can relate to. I still have the same critical eye towards society, though. I just don&apos;t play squats any more.&quot; M\u00f8 started branching out towards a more clean-cut career in the latter days of Mor, when she sent an a cappella vocal track to the producer Ronni Vindahl, who has worked on her forthcoming debut album, No Mythologies to Follow. It&apos;s a classy, confident effort that maintains an alternative heart without compromising its mainstream aspirations. The new single Don&apos;t Wanna Dance has a minimal electronic beat that soon gives way to a huge chorus; Never Wanna Know is pure Phil Spector retroism, M\u00f8 chastising an ex-boyfriend over the timeless Be My Baby beat. One of the standouts, Glass, is an ode to nostalgia and longing for the ease of youth. &quot;I think everyone grew up thinking that by their mid-20s they&apos;d have everything sorted out, but I know I don&apos;t. There is this unidentifiable problem of wanting more from life and never being satisfied,&quot; she say, before adding bleakly: &quot;The days are slipping away and you&apos;re one step closer to death. Life was so easy as a child, maybe you fall over and you cry but you get back up again.&quot; I ask if M\u00f8 spends too much time online. She admits to &quot;Fomo&quot;: the fear of missing out. &quot;I try not to spend too much time online but at the same time if I didn&apos;t, I&apos;d be isolated. You hear about a party and think I have to go, I don&apos;t want to miss out, and then you go and you just feel like: &apos;Urgh, what am I doing here?&apos;&quot; But then again, sometimes being online does stop you missing out. Diplo, for example, produced M\u00f8&apos;s song XXX 88 after the pair hooked up via Twitter. &quot;I was asked in an interview who I would most like to work with and I said Major Lazer. A guy on Twitter read the interview and tweeted Diplo, saying: &apos;Make this happen.&apos; He saw it and said he was a fan, so we met up in Amsterdam and began working together.&quot; \u00d8rsted&apos;s choice of subjects is unusual for a budding pop star, tackling issues such as youth malaise and Denmark&apos;s benefits culture, which is how the whole Danish-pop-star-does-Jeremy-Kyle thing came up in the first place. And if it is strange to hear a young person with a history in protest and activism suddenly start talking as though she&apos;s on a late-night radio phone-in, M\u00f8 is the first to admit she does not have the answers. &quot;I feel young and confused. The album is discussing issues, but I don&apos;t have the answer.

The move comes as international tensions continue to mount over the presence of Russian troops in the peninsula, which reportedly now number 30,000. Ukraine&apos;s interim prime minister warned the Crimean parliament that &quot;no one in the civilised world&quot; would recognize its referendum, calling the vote &quot;unconstitutional&quot; and &quot;illegitimate&quot;. But the referendum has the support of the Russian parliament, with the speaker of the upper house saying that Russia would &quot;unquestionably back&quot; the referendum&apos;s choice. The EU and US are mulling sanctions \u2013 so far targeting a small number of individuals with visa bans and asset freezes. This comes as a team of OSCE observers has been prevented for a second day from entering Crimea by unidentified armed men. Why does Russia have a naval base in Crimea? \u2022 Geographic limitations and ambitions: Russia&apos;s capacity to reach the sea is limited by geography, so ports in the north and south seas, leading to larger waters, are crucial. As the map below illustrates, Sevastopol is a strategically important base for Russia&apos;s naval fleet, in addition to being Russia&apos;s only warm water base. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a 1997 treaty with Ukraine allowed Russia to keep its Black Sea Fleet pretty much intact (with 15,000 personnel currently stationed) and lease the base at Sevastopol (extended to expire in 2042).     The Black Sea and Sevastopol. Photograph: /Wikimedia    As Orlando Figes, author of Crimea: The Last Crusade, wrote last week:  Crimea was bound to be the focus of the Russian backlash against the Ukrainian revolution. ... For more than 20 years, ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, its rule by Kiev has been a major source of Russian resentment \u2013 inside and outside Crimea \u2013 and a major thorn in Ukraine&apos;s relations with Russia. The Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation \u2013 by which Russia rents its naval base at Sevastopol from the Ukrainian government \u2013 is so far-reaching in the rights it gives the Russians to exercise their military powers that it is seen by many in Ukraine to undermine the country&apos;s independence. In 2008 the Ukrainians said they would not renew the lease when it expired in 2017. But they buckled under the pressure of a gas-price hike and, in 2010, extended the Russian navy&apos;s lease until 2042.  \u2022 Projecting power: Sevastopol has been an important hub to project Russia&apos;s naval power on a global platform. The Black Sea Fleet has seen a flurry of activity since 2008: during the war with Georgia that year, the fleet staged blockades in the Black Sea. The Russian navy was actively engaged with Vietnam, Syria and Venezuela (and up until March 2011, Libya) &quot;for logistics and repair services in their principal ports&quot;. It has also been alleged that Sevastopol has served as the main source in supplying the Assad regime during Syria&apos;s civil war and proved useful with Russia&apos;s role in dismantling Syria&apos;s chemical weapons last year. After Syria&apos;s civil war forced Russia to stop using its naval base in the Syrian port of Tartus last year, Sevastopol became even more crucial.    #Russian forces scupper a ship in the only entrance to Donuzlslav bay in western #Crimea, trapping Ukrainian vessels. pic.twitter.com/2yD8gU7tZz&mdash; Tom Barton (@TomBartonJourno) March 6, 2014   You can find our explainer on the issue of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity  here, and the on the diplomatic deal that&apos;s at stake here. A brief history of Crimea and Crimean Tatars \u2022 Before Tsarist subsumption: For five hundred years \u2013 roughly the middle ages in Europe \u2013 Turkic and Tatar tribes traded rule of Crimea. The peninsula spent a few hundred years as a Muslim Khanate and then an Ottoman vassal state, until Russia annexed it in 1783, under Catherine the Great, who thought the region symbolized Russia&apos;s links to antiquity. (She proceeded to parcel out land to aristocrats and build classical-style palaces and gardens.) By 1900, the Crimean Tatars, once the majority, had been halved by wars and campaigns of Russification. Their population was halved again in 1917, and shortly after that, Stalin forcibly deported most of the remaining Tatars to central Asia. Unsurprisingly, Tatars have largely held fiercely anti-Russian sentiments for a very long time. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tatars have been returning, and though they number upwards of 200,000, they&apos;re still a minority. \u2022 Crimean War: With its Black Sea fleet based in Sevastopol, Tsar Nicholas I knocked the Ottoman Empire out of the region \u2013 a hugely symbolic feat considering Russia&apos;s tricky relationship with its Muslim population and its centuries in need of a fleet.     Pro-Russian Cossacks share a laugh next to a war monument in Simferopol. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images    But Nicholas&apos; overconfidence in Crimea in part led to the Crimean war with Britain and France, whose leaders sought to stop Russia&apos;s expanding borders and to slow its influence in the Middle East. The allies won the war, bestowing British culture with the Charge of the Light Brigade, Florence Nightingale and Timothy the Tortoise. The Russians lost, but Tolstoy&apos;s Sevastopol Sketches made sure that the 11-month siege of Sevastopol stuck in the national memory. (Between Sevastopol in 1854 and Leningrad in the second world war, the notorious Russian &quot;siege mentality&quot; may begin to make sense.) \u2022 Khrushchev to Yeltsin: Crimea was given to Ukraine by premier Nikita Khrushchev (himself born at the border with Ukraine) to mark the 300th anniversary of Ukraine&apos;s inclusion in the Russian Empire, a &quot;donation&quot; many in Russia still see as illegitimate. Surprisingly, Boris Yeltsin, the first president of post-Soviet Russia, didn&apos;t propose an acquisition of Crimea during negotiations to dissolve the Soviet Republics. Peter the Great gets his own section \u2022 Let&apos;s build some boats: Peter the Great changed the course of history in countless ways, and was an extremely strange man and very serious about boats. (He supposedly said &quot;A great leader who has an army has one hand, but he who has a navy has two.&quot; As a child, he would order around the children of other noblemen as &quot;regiments&quot; pretending to prepare for war. As an adult, he built a small boat by hand and used it to sail across the Neva, the river that runs through St Petersburg.) After a long trip in his youth to western Europe, in particular Amsterdam, where he studied shipbuilding, he returned to Moscow obsessed with dragging Russia into modernity \u2013 and making it a rival of the nations he saw in Europe.     Peter the Great: an odd duck    Peter saw Russia&apos;s limited access to the ocean as one of its greatest weaknesses, and though it meant tens of thousands of dead serfs to build a city on a unforgiving swamp, he had St Petersburg built on the Gulf of Finland for this very reason: he would reach the sea at every opportunity. With his new northern capital giving access to the Baltic, Peter countered the power of his arch-rival, King Charles XII of Sweden. (To give you an idea of how deep-seated the contest over Ukraine is, Peter defeated Charles&apos; attempt to conquer Ukraine at the 1709 battle of Poltava.) To the south, Peter fought wars against the Tatars (who else) to gain access to the Black Sea, and built Russia&apos;s first naval base in Taganrog in 1698.", "sentences": ["After a long trip in his youth to western Europe, in particular Amsterdam, where he studied shipbuilding, he returned to Moscow obsessed with dragging Russia into modernity \u2013 and making it a rival of the nations he saw in Europe."], "title": "Ukraine crisis: why Russia sees Crimea as its naval stronghold", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/07/ukraine-russia-crimea-naval-base-tatars-explainer", "tags": ["Crimea", "Ukraine", "Russia", "European Union", "World news", "US news", "Foreign policy"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-08T08:15:00Z", "article": "Mr and Mrs William Blake were out in the summerhouse reading Paradise Lost in their natural state (freed from the &quot;troublesome disguises&quot; of clothes) when Thomas Butts came to\u00a0call. William cheerfully invited his friend to join them \u2013 which was all very\u00a0well, but how did she feel? Butts&apos; account of his visit is one of the shards of evidence nicely deployed and amplified in Park&apos;s fictional rendering of the Blake m\u00e9nage. But\u00a0this hugely ambitious novel about\u00a0three women \u2013 Catherine Blake, Nadezhda Mandelstam, and the wife of an imaginary Irish poet \u2013 is a puzzling addition to the ever-expanding genre of biographical fiction. The first section, narrated by an elderly Mrs Blake, is by far the best. This is the story of a woman who could not read the poet&apos;s love letters until he taught her how, who trusted absolutely in the veracity of his visions, and who learned to share her house with divine company only he could see. We know what Blake&apos;s life-mask looks like (it survives in the Fitzwilliam Museum, tense and resistant); Park imagines how Catherine bathed his face in warm water after the plaster was removed, bringing his expression back to life. Fiction can be a powerful testing ground for hypotheses and for empathetic filling of history&apos;s gaps \u2013 which is why there have been several recent fictional versions of Mrs Blake. But this is dangerous territory. Park imagines an early miscarriage which leaves Catherine infertile; William, in\u00a0his grief, rejects his wife&apos;s body and turns elsewhere. Does it matter that Blake is charged, in fiction, with this cruelty? The question may be part of Park&apos;s point. There is nothing speculative about the essential facts of the second section: Osip Mandelstam was exiled, then sentenced to hard labour for his anti-Stalinist poetry. He died at a transit camp in 1938 and his work was preserved solely in the memory of his wife. Park folds the joint lives of the Mandelstams during the 1930s into a\u00a0single exhausting scene as Nadezhda stands in a three-hour queue to post a\u00a0parcel to Osip, not yet knowing he is\u00a0dead. Imagining the women in that queue as they edge closer to the blank face of the clerk behind the window, Park honours &quot;the vastness of all their inner worlds&quot;, feeling carefully for the relationship between their &quot;molten grief&quot; and numbness. Arriving at last at the front, Nadezhda must say who her parcel is for: she &quot;gives the poet&apos;s name her voice&quot;, as she will do now for the rest of her life. Park&apos;s main source for Nadezhda is\u00a0her own autobiographical writing, though here lies a problem. Hope Against Hope is an extraordinary memoir written with sudden flashing brilliance. Nadezhda begins with a punch (&quot;After slapping Alexei Tolstoi in\u00a0the face, M. immediately returned to\u00a0Moscow&quot;) and goes on that way. Few\u00a0writers could live up to her; Park\u00a0is\u00a0paying tribute, but his fictional Nadezhda is outwritten and outshone. The third section brings us to contemporary Northern Ireland, where\u00a0a wife fulfils the last wishes of a\u00a0second-rate poet destined not to be much missed. This is a study of secret, sideways mourning, as Lydia longs for\u00a0her lost son rather than for her dutifully feted husband. Park himself is a Northern Irish writer of great talents. In his acclaimed 2008 novel The Truth Commissioner, he invented a fictional commission to\u00a0examine the Troubles. His last novel, The Light of Amsterdam, was a\u00a0patient study of three out-of-kilter relationships reaching crises and uncertain resolutions. Its small epiphanies came in chip shops at closing time; its central concern was not with love affairs but with the cautious tenderness of parents for elusive grown-up children. Similar qualities come through in this new book. Lydia&apos;s grown-up children are superbly done, and so is falling out of love, &quot;a slow release like clasped hands gradually slipping&quot;. There are finely observed slips between scepticism and superstition, and moments of residual faith among disenchanted people. Park continues his strenuous examination of the relations between truth and imagination. In The Poets&apos; Wives he poses questions of a high order about what literature is and what\u00a0it is made from. Lydia asks sadly why her husband wrote poems of grief\u00a0for their lost son when he had never shown such emotion in private. &quot;If it were true why the need to put it in a book? Why the need to give it to anyone other than his son?&quot; The novel yields no answers. The Blakes and the Mandelstams staked their lives on the need to put feelings into books, but it is hard to compare Songs of Innocence with the indifferent poems of an invented poet. Switching from first-person to third-person, from\u00a0one temporal complication to the next, The Poets&apos; Wives demands more patience than it ever quite rewards. We\u00a0have one poet deemed mad, a second persecuted and killed, a third who lives comfortably and is blandly praised. We have two lost children, many forms of grief and remembrance, two real women and one invented woman in different centuries and different countries. They talk gravely of many things, but they do not talk very clearly to each other across the divide. \u2022 Alexandra Harris&apos;s Virginia Woolf is published by Thames &amp; Hudson", "sentences": ["His last novel, The Light of Amsterdam, was a\u00a0patient study of three out-of-kilter relationships reaching crises and uncertain resolutions."], "title": "The Poets' Wives review \u2013 strands of separation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/08/poets-wives-review-david-park", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-08T22:09:13Z", "article": "When the director Steve McQueen was an art student learning basic film-making skills at Goldsmiths College, London, he joked he was already aiming for the time when his name would eclipse that of his glamorous namesake, star of The Great Escape and Bullitt. &quot;One day,&quot; he told his collaborator, Professor Will Brooker, &quot;when people talk about Steve McQueen, I am going to be the first person they think of.&quot; Now, with an Oscar for his film 12 Years a Slave, the transition from Turner prizewinning artist to celebrated director has been made in style. It is a path to cinematography also taken by the British artist Sam Taylor-Wood, nominated for a Turner prize in 1998 and now editing her high-profile film of the erotic bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey. Next month will see a further reminder of the link between the film industry and the rarefied contemporary art world, a link that has existed since the Lumi\u00e8re brothers first projected images on to a screen. Julian Schnabel, the American artist and film-maker, is to stage his first art exhibition in Britain for 15 years. &quot;The connection between visual artists and film might seem obvious, and Schnabel is successful in both, but it is amazing how many good artists there are who have not made good films,&quot; said Tim Marlow, who was appointed head of exhibitions at the Royal Academy of Arts last week. Back in the 1920s Jean Cocteau, the toast of bohemian Paris, put away his paintbrush and typewriter in favour of the motion camera, creating surrealist classics of the cinema such as La Belle et la B\u00eate, while his compatriot Jean Renoir, son of the painter Auguste-Pierre, made ceramic pots long before he made his film La Grande Illusion in 1937. Since then many influential directors, including the late Japanese master Akira Kurosawa, have started out as painters or sculptors. But does an artist really have to choose? Is it possible to keep a reputation going in both fields? Schnabel certainly thinks it is. Before his show, at the Dairy Art Centre in London, he says he still regards himself as &quot;primarily an artist&quot;, despite the critical success of his films Basquiat, Before Night Falls and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. McQueen could find such a trick hard to pull off. Last month he quietly withdrew his name from consideration for the $100,000 2014 Hugo Boss prize, administered by New York&apos;s Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, due to the demands of promoting 12 Years a Slave in Los Angeles. He had been unable, it was announced, to fulfil the requirements of making a large contribution to the prize show catalogue. Now it looks as if McQueen, who lives in Amsterdam, will have little time for fine art. Although he has dropped his planned biopic of the musician Fela Kuti, he is developing major television series for both the BBC and the American network HBO. The HBO show is to tell the story of a young African-American man who enters New York high society, while the BBC has commissioned a new drama about the lives of black Britons. Each of these TV projects will reach a larger audience than the video installations that first made McQueen&apos;s name. In his 1993 black and white silent film, Bear, two naked men exchange meaningful glances in the gloom, while in Deadpan, a work shown in his winning 1999 Turner prize show, he restaged a Buster Keaton stunt in which the film-set facade of houses collapses around an unscathed lone figure. McQueen has said he sees no division between his work in cinema and his fine art. It is all part of what he wants to do creatively, he argues. And if anyone can straddle these two worlds then it is McQueen, according to Gregor Muir, executive director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, in London. &quot;He is an extraordinary man,&quot; said Muir. &quot;He was not just an artist who became a film director, he was one of the best artists of his generation. He has surprised us throughout his career.&quot; To underline McQueen&apos;s value, four days ago a leading Dutch museum acquired two of his artworks. The pieces \u2013 a lightbox containing a photograph of a boy on a beach and footage of a dead horse lying in a meadow \u2013 will go on display in December at the Stedelijk in Amsterdam, a museum that already owns 7th Nov, his 2001 short film recounting the events of a fatal accident. Commenting on the purchase of these works, the BBC&apos;s arts editor Will Gompertz saw a false distinction between art and showbiz that assumes that the art world represents &quot;a refined elite above the vulgarities of consumer society&quot;, while, in fact, &quot;it is just as intoxicated by the razzledazzle of celebrity culture as the readers of Grazia. Fame in the art world has the same effect as fame in the rest of society: it raises the value of an individual&apos;s stock.&quot; Muir, who evangelised about the importance of video art when he worked at the Lux Gallery in east London and then at the Tate before he ran the ICA, thinks there is another false distinction at work. &quot;We shouldn&apos;t assume that fine art is always going to be less popular or entertaining than a commercially made film,&quot; he said, citing the example of Christian Marclay&apos;s acclaimed 24-hour montage, The Clock. &quot;In the early 1990s artists began to explore film because suddenly they had access to camcorders and digital film-making. They could deconstruct film as never before, whereas in the past artists had to form co-operatives to make videos together.&quot; Muir points out the ICA&apos;s role at that moment. In 1999 the institute was the venue for McQueen&apos;s first big solo show, although some of his work had been shown by a London dealer. Tracey Emin was one of the first to jump into film with her short biographical pieces. &quot;Tracey received a lot of support for her early films, both in the world of art and of film,&quot; recalls Muir. &quot;Some of those early films were truly touching vignettes.&quot; But it was McQueen and Taylor-Wood, now known as Sam Taylor-Johnson following her marriage to actor Aaron Johnson, and acclaimed for her debut feature Nowhere Boy, who were to head for the big screen. &quot;Sam saw a path for herself and she has taken it. But Steve and Douglas Gordon, the artist who made a film about the French footballer Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, were both influenced by the artists Bill Nauman and Bill Viola and wanted to expand on their ideas. It was clear they wanted to test the way in which narrative film could exist as an art form. They had quite a different route from Schnabel, who just suddenly surprised us with his rare talent in film.&quot; First to spot McQueen&apos;s thirst for cinema may have been Will Brooker, who worked alongside the artist at Goldsmiths and who is now a Kingston University professor of film and cultural studies. &quot;McQueen uses a sustained long take as a motif in his work \u2013 he won&apos;t cut away and is committed to shooting difficult and sometimes unpleasant scenes, which ties in with my sense of him from 20 years ago,&quot; Brooker said. &quot;He&apos;s brought a fine art sensibility to cinema and film is the tool for his art.&quot; For Muir, the key consideration is the fearlessness the right artist can bring to cinema: &quot;This is the route, we should remember, that gave us not only the first black director to win the best film Oscar, but also the first woman to win an Oscar. Kathryn Bigelow, who won in 2009 for The Hurt Locker, was a painter and conceptual artist before she made Strange Days and Point Break with Keanu Reeves. She was one of the first artists to cross over into narrative film. Both these artists have pushed things in film because that is what artists do.&quot; Muir also has a claim to have predicted the influence of video artists on the film industry. In an article for Arena in the 1990s he suggested some stars of the art world might go on to make the big films of the future. &quot;At least I don&apos;t need to eat my hat on that one,&quot; he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 March 2014. An earlier version said that Professor Will Brooker was Steve McQueen&apos;s tutor at Goldsmiths.

Saajid Badat, who became a valuable turncoat after being jailed in 2005, is due to be beamed via video link into the Manhattan courtroom a few blocks from Ground Zero where Suleiman Abu Ghaith is on trial for conspiring to kill Americans and giving support to the jihadist network. Amid complaints from defence lawyers that his testimony cannot be trusted because it helped buy his early release from prison, Badat is also being lined up to give evidence in the New York trial of Abu Hamza, the radical cleric deported from London, and in the sentencing of Babar Ahmad and Syed Talha Ahsan, Britons who pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in Connecticut. Badat, 35, who was raised in Gloucester, is appearing by video because he faces criminal charges in Boston if he enters the US. He may also be called to testify in the military tribunal at Guant\u00e1namo Bay of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-professed mastermind of the September 11 attacks on the US. US prosecutors plan on Monday to use Badat\u2019s confession that he and fellow Briton Richard Reid conspired to bring down passenger jets with shoe bombs late in 2001 as evidence that statements by Abu Ghaith after September 11 that \u201cthe storm of airplanes will not stop\u201d related to specific plots. \u201cAfter you hear his testimony, and compare it to the defendant\u2019s \u2018storm of airplanes\u2019 warning, you will know that the defendant was not making empty threats,\u201d assistant US attorney Nicholas Lewin told the jury in his opening statement last week. \u201cHe was deadly serious.\u201d Abu Ghaith appeared with Bin Laden in video clips soon after September 11 and is accused of using \u201cthe murderous power of his words\u201d to help recruit new jihadists. He is married to Bin Laden\u2019s eldest daughter, Fatima, one of nearly two dozen children said to have been fathered by the al-Qaida leader before he was killed in a raid by US navy Seals in Pakistan in 2011. Badat is expected to testify about his training in \u201curban warfare\u201d in spring 2001 at an al-Qaida camp in Afghanistan, where Abu Ghaith delivered a speech later that year. He has said he took part in firearms training in which students shot at balloons labelled \u201cBlair\u201d, \u201cClinton\u201d and \u201cSharon\u201d. He told authorities after his arrest in Lancashire in 2003 that he backed out of the shoe-bombing plot after booking a flight to Amsterdam, from where he had planned to fly to the US. Reid tried unsuccessfully to detonate his explosives on a flight to Miami in December 2001. Now notorious as \u201cthe shoe bomber\u201d, he is serving a life sentence in a US supermax jail. Badat received a 13-year sentence at the Old Bailey in 2005 but was released after six years, after agreeing to assist terrorism prosecutions in Britain and the US. In 2012 it emerged in separate court proceedings in New York that he had been given public funds by the British government for rehousing, education, his mobile phone bill and other costs. He told the court in 2012 that after receiving funding for office space and training he had found a job, but did not elaborate. Further details of his present-day life may emerge on Monday under questioning from prosecutors and Abu Ghaith\u2019s lawyers, who have flown in from New York. Stanley Cohen, Abu Ghaith\u2019s lead attorney, mocked Badat during his own opening statement last week as an overhyped \u201csupergrass\u201d. He described Badat as \u201cthe real terrorist\u201d and suggested his testimony was questionable because it was linked to his early release. \u201cThey sit around and talk, and he gives them what they want,\u201d Cohen said of Badat and western law-enforcement authorities. \u201cBut the one thing he doesn\u2019t do is put Suleiman Abu Ghaith at the centre of a shoe-bombing plot. \u201cThe interesting thing is, this supergrass, he takes training in bomb-making, he takes training in poison-making, he is one of their key underground people. But when asked 10 years ago, \u2018Who is Suleiman Abu Ghaith?\u2019 you don\u2019t hear a word. He says, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 At one point, he says the name rings a bell.\u201d Cohen told the Guardian on Sunday that after hearing Badat\u2019s testimony \u201cnot a person in that courtroom will believe anything the guy says\u201d. \u201cThis is a man who tried to become a mass-murderer,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cHe is under indictment in the US and would face a life sentence. Yet there has been no attempt to extradite him and he only served six years. He got a pretty good deal.\u201d  Badat is expected to tell the court in the Connecticut trial of Ahmad and Ahsan that Ahmad was the person who sent him to Afghanistan to train for jihad, and to tell Abu Hamza\u2019s trial in New York that he trained at the camp alongside a \u201clieutenant\u201d sent by the radical cleric formerly of the Finsbury Park mosque. Lawyers for Ahmad and Ahsan argued to the judge in Connecticut last week that if Badat could not be forced to testify in person, they and their clients should be present in the room while he is questioned. \u201cOf all the possible witnesses from whom the government could seek to elicit testimony, the witness has perhaps the greatest incentive to lie and the greatest need for effective confrontation,\u201d the lawyers wrote in a court filing. \u201cThe benefits he is receiving for his cooperation are vast.\u201d US prosecutors previously said Badat was personally instructed for his shoe-bomb plot by Bin Laden and Mohammed. Badat may also be called to testify at Mohammed\u2019s ongoing tribunal at the US naval base in Cuba. He also said during the 2012 proceedings, which related to the trial of Adis Medunjanin, a Bosnian-born American accused of plotting to bomb the New York subway system, that he had planned previously undisclosed attacks against Jewish targets in South Africa for al-Qaida.", "sentences": ["He told authorities after his arrest in Lancashire in 2003 that he backed out of the shoe-bombing plot after booking a flight to Amsterdam, from where he had planned to fly to the US."], "title": "British al-Qaida turncoat to testify in trial of Bin Laden's son-in-law", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/09/bin-laden-son-in-law-trial", "tags": ["Al-Qaida", "Osama bin Laden", "US news", "UK news", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-09T18:00:00Z", "article": "A trip to Adelaide is a long-haul experience. It&apos;s wise to drink plenty of fluids, flex your muscles periodically within your seat, and wear those socks designed to prevent deep-vein thrombosis. And that&apos;s just for the duration of the performances at this year&apos;s festival. The opening weekend was the ultimate artistic endurance event. The Amsterdam Toneelgroep&apos;s Roman Tragedies (Coriolanus, Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra all run consecutively, in Dutch, without an interval) was followed by Matthew Barney&apos;s River of Fundament, a six-hour film based on Norman Mailer&apos;s sexually explicit fantasy about Egyptian gods&apos; obsession with their stools. For the time-rich and culture-hungry, it&apos;s a challenge. For anyone still suffering fromjet\u00a0lag, it&apos;s\u00a0brutal. Ever since Wagner established the Bayreuth Festspielhaus as the high temple of long operas and hard seating, massive feats of concentration have been the international arts festival&apos;s stock-in-trade. Adelaide has a proud history of huge marquee events \u2013 as its artistic director David Sefton says, &quot;We we were the first Australian festival to present Peter Brook&apos;s Mahabharata, the first to show Robert LePage&apos;s Seven Streams of the River Ota, we put on Australia&apos;s first Ring Cycle. People complain about it at the time, yet these are the productions that are still talked about today. I have no doubt that people will still be talking about the Roman Tragedies 10 years from now.&quot; Does he feel that the job of a festival programmer is to counteract the contracting attention of the twittering classes? &quot;Actually, I don&apos;t really buy that stuff about everything dumbing down to suit the YouTube generation. The extraordinary thing about the Roman Tragedies is that it happily embraces all of that \u2013 you&apos;ve got rolling news, music videos, the audience being encouraged to tweet their responses on stage. Yet it&apos;s all at the service of a radical rereading of Shakespeare that has people utterly enthralled by renaissance drama.&quot; So what is Sefton&apos;s guiding principle behind programming the Amsterdam Toneelgroep and Mathew Barney back to back? &quot;My overall message? Bring a cushion. Seriously, it wasn&apos;t the original intention to run them so close together, but sometimes you can only work around available dates. But as I think anyone who sat through them will agree, the amount of time you devote to a piece of art completely transforms your experience of it.&quot; That certainly became the case at the longest single festival event I have ever attended: Nikhil Chopra&apos;s performance piece Coal on Cotton, which was presented at Manchester International festival last year. The work commenced at 4.45am on a Friday morning and ran continuously until sunset the following Sunday \u2013 though for those prepared to stay for the entire duration, the performance gave a sense of collective transformation that only watching an Indian performance artist slowly putting up a tent can. Yet Chopra&apos;s feats of endurance are the blink of an eye compared to the figure who was arguably the world&apos;s first performance artist, the early fifth-century mystic Simeon Stylites, who spent 37 years on top of a pillar. You could make a case that Michelangelo&apos;s four-year labour on the Sistine ceiling was as significant as the finished result. But suffering \u2013 or, in the case of Vito Acconci, pleasuring \u2013 oneself for one&apos;s art became fashionable in the 1960s and 70s, when Acconci undertook marathon masturbation sessions beneath a gallery floor, and fellow US performance artist Chris Burden made the messianic gesture of nailing himself to a Volkswagen. At the same time, the work of avant-garde composers began to reach unprecedented lengths. Towards the end of his career Morton Feldman concentrated on minimal chamber works such as String Quartet II, in which very little happens over the course of a single movement lasting six hours; while Charlemagne Palestine staged titanic solo performances that involved pounding a grand piano with his fists until there was blood on the keys.     Shakespeare marathon \u2026 Roman Tragedies. Photograph: Tony Lewis    The young, Israeli-born conductor Ilan Volkov describes his first Morton Feldman concert as a life-changing experience. &quot;I was 13 when my father took me to one of the big cello and piano pieces. It started with a reasonably full room that gradually dwindled until we were the only ones left. I had no idea how long the cycle was going to last, but after about 10 minutes or so I began to realise that nothing else was going to be added, and began to suppress my instinct for wanting more. It was the moment when I first began to understand contemporary music.&quot; In 2013, Volkov presented the first of his ground-breaking series of mega-concerts under the Tectonics banner, in which the worlds of the symphony orchestra, electronica and improvisation collide. There have been Tectonics events in Reykjavik and Glasgow. This year, Volkov brings the franchise to the Adelaide festival with two programmes totalling 14 hours. &quot;It&apos;s less about the shock value because these things have become quite natural now,&quot; Volkov says. &quot;People know it&apos;s going to be long, but you have to place your trust in each composer to manage your time.&quot; Audiences are free to come and go however, while Volkov&apos;s programmes place a strong emphasis on participation, even singing along. Lighting, sound and staging are all integral to the experience, and Volkov is even prepared to consider the Amsterdam Toneelgroep&apos;s example of opening a bar on stage. &quot;Why not?&quot; he says. &quot;I think we&apos;re moving closer to the situation in which the borders between the theatre, the gallery and the concert hall dissolve.&quot; Yet is the new paradigm of on-stage refreshments and Wi-Fi access in danger of destroying the ritualistic aspect of long-form entertainment? If art has expanded to fill the void left by religion, then it&apos;s chief prophet must be John Zorn. Zorn is an omnivorous devourer of the world&apos;s musics from free jazz to death metal, but at the centre of his oeuvre is the klezmer-inspired Masada songbooks, containing \u2013 at the last count \u2013 613 compositions inspired by Jewish spirituality. The First Book came out in 1993, The Book of Angels followed in 2004 and the newest addition, the Book Beriah, has recently appeared to mark the composer&apos;s 60th birthday. Zorn&apos;s four concerts in Adelaide are the first he has ever given in Australia, including a five-and-a-half hour Masada marathon whose scale and ambition feels comparable to the Old Testament on shuffle. &quot;The world needs visionaries like Zorn and Matthew Barney,&quot; David Sefton argues. &quot;Their work is so singularly uncompromising it has an almost shamanistic quality.&quot; But would he really watch the whole of River of Fundament again? &quot;I have no doubt that it&apos;s a great work that will always reveal more on repeated viewings,&quot; he replies. &quot;But put it this way: I&apos;m not that impatient to see the director&apos;s cut.&quot;", "sentences": ["The Amsterdam Toneelgroep&apos;s Roman Tragedies (Coriolanus, Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra all run consecutively, in Dutch, without an interval) was followed by Matthew Barney&apos;s River of Fundament, a six-hour film based on Norman Mailer&apos;s sexually explicit fantasy about Egyptian gods&apos; obsession with their stools.", "Yet it&apos;s all at the service of a radical rereading of Shakespeare that has people utterly enthralled by renaissance drama.&quot; So what is Sefton&apos;s guiding principle behind programming the Amsterdam Toneelgroep and Mathew Barney back to back?", "Lighting, sound and staging are all integral to the experience, and Volkov is even prepared to consider the Amsterdam Toneelgroep&apos;s example of opening a bar on stage."], "title": "In for the long haul: the rise and rise of epic arts events", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/mar/09/adelaide-festival-2014-endurance-art", "tags": ["Adelaide festival 2014", "Immersive theatre", "William Shakespeare", "Stage", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-09T19:27:00Z", "article": "The Malaysia Airlines flight missing with 239 on board may have turned around just before it vanished from radar screens, the country&apos;s air force chief said on Sunday as the government said it had contacted counter-terrorism agencies around the world following concerns over unidentified passengers. Transport and defence minister Hishamuddin Hussein said officials were considering all possible explanations for the disappearance of flight MH370, adding: &quot;We cannot jump the gun. Our focus now is to find the plane.&quot; The airline warned families to prepare for the worst as the search widened amid inconclusive reports that debris had been spotted floating in the sea between Vietnam and Malaysia. At least two people on the plane were travelling together on stolen passports, fuelling concerns about the Boeing-777&apos;s abrupt disappearance in the early hours of Saturday. However, experts said there were many possible reasons for why it vanished and for people to travel on false documents. Malaysian officials said they were looking at four suspect identities and were examining the entire passenger manifest. Interpol confirmed that at least two passports were listed in its database as stolen and that it was examining other documents. The international police agency&apos;s secretary general, Ronald Noble, said it had spent years urging countries to screen all passports systematically. &quot;Now, we have a real case where the world is speculating whether the stolen passport holders were terrorists, while Interpol is asking why only a handful of countries worldwide are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights,&quot; he said. Two-thirds of the travellers were Chinese, while the rest were from elsewhere in Asia, North America and Europe. The vast search area in the seas between Malaysia and Vietnam expanded further on Sunday because of the plane&apos;s apparent turn off course. At least 40 ships and 22 aircraft from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, China and the United States are participating in the hunt.     The head of the MMEA, Mohd Amdan Kurish, left, checks a radar during the search for the missing plane. Photograph: AP    The director general of the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) said it had sent a patrol ship to gather samples from an oil slick to determine whether the oil came from the flight or a passing ship, the government-backed Bernama website reported. No debris was found nearby. The Beijing-bound Boeing-777 had reached cruising altitude when it disappeared from radar screens around 40 minutes after taking off from Kuala Lumpur at 12.40am on Saturday. Both the airline and the aircraft model have strong safety records. The weather was generally good and the plane did not issue a distress signal. Malaysia&apos;s air force chief Rodzali Daud told a press conference that it appeared to have gone off-route. &quot;We are trying to make sense of this \u2026 The military radar indicated that the aircraft may have made a turn back and in some parts, this was corroborated by civilian radar,&quot; he said. The chief executive of Malaysia Airlines, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said the plane had not informed the airline and air traffic control authorities of its change of course, as it was supposed to do in such circumstances. The pilot of another flight told a Malaysian newspaper he had made brief contact with the plane via his emergency frequency at the request of Vietnamese aviation authorities who were expecting it to enter their airspace but had been unable to reach it. The unnamed man said he was deep into Vietnamese airspace when officials asked him to relay to MH370 to establish its position, and that he succeeded at around 1.30am \u2013 around 10 minutes after the last recorded flight data. &quot;There [was] a lot of interference \u2026 static \u2026 but I heard mumbling from the other end,&quot; he said, adding that he believed the voice belonged to the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid. He then lost the connection, he told the New Straits Times. An airline pilot who flew within 100 nautical miles of the route 12 hours before the Malaysia Airline flight disappeared said there were large thunderstorms in the area, with some turbulence, but the weather did not appear to pose serious problems for commercial flights. While the circumstances of the plane&apos;s disappearance are extremely unusual, an Air France flight vanished without warning over the South Atlantic in 2009; investigators blamed that crash on a combination of technical problems and pilot error. Experts also cautioned that there were various reasons why people could be on board with invalid documents. In 2010, when an Air India Express flight overshot the runway at Mangalore, killing 160, it emerged that 10 of those on board had fraudulent passports. One US Department of Homeland Security official told the Los Angeles Times: &quot;Just because they were stolen doesn&apos;t mean the travellers were terrorists.&quot;     Vietnamese air force crew prepare to head out from Tan Son Nhat airport to search for the Malaysian airliner. Photograph: AP    The passengers, using the names Luigi Maraldi and Christian Kozel, bought consecutive tickets on 6 March from China Southern, which had a codeshare agreement for the flight, paying in Thai baht. They were booked together to Beijing, where they would have had a stopover of just over 10 hours before travelling onwards to Amsterdam. &quot;Maraldi&quot; was then booked to fly to Copenhagen while &quot;Kozel&quot; was booked on a flight to Frankfurt. Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, Malaysia&apos;s civil aviation chief, told a press conference investigators were looking at CCTV footage of the individuals on those passports &quot;from check-in to departure&quot;. The real Maraldi and Kozel \u2013 Italian and Austrian nationals respectively \u2013 had previously reported their passports stolen in the region. Maraldi told a Thai website he lost his in a deal that went wrong at a motorcycle rental shop in Phuket. The Malaysian transport and defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein said authorities were looking at two more possible cases of suspicious identities. &quot;All the four names are with me and have been given to our intelligence agencies,&quot; he said. &quot;We are looking at all possibilities.&quot; No information has been issued on the other cases under review. Chinese state media reported that one of the passport numbers reported on the manifest belonged to a man from Fujian, eastern China, who was safe and well. But his name was not that listed alongside the number, which according to the manifest belonged to another Chinese man. The man told police his passport had not been lost or stolen. An FBI team is on its way to assist the investigation because three Americans were on board. Experts from the National Transportation Safety Board \u2013 which investigates all US domestic civil aviation crashes \u2013 the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing are also flying to the region, the NTSB said in a statement.

Luigi Maraldi, 37, said he was on holiday last summer when he left his passport at an undisclosed rental shop in Patong, the resort island&apos;s tourist centre, only to discover when he later went to collect it that the shop owner had handed it over to a man who &quot;looked similar&quot;. Passports are often asked in exchange for car and motorbike rentals in Phuket \u2013 visited by 12 million tourists every year \u2013 but the island is a hotbed of identity theft, and complaints of stolen and lost passports are rife. According to Italian honorary consul Francesco Pensato said: &quot;We have 250,000 [Italian] tourists a season, so it&apos;s normal that [some] lose a passport.&quot; Pensato confirmed that Maraldi had had his passport stolen in Phuket in July last year, and that the number of the passport used to board the flight was the same as that of the stolen passport \u2013 ruling out any possibility that there was another Luigi Maraldi with the same date of birth who may have been on board. Christian Kozel, the 30-year-old Austrian citizen listed on the flight&apos;s manifest, also had his passport stolen two years ago during a flight from Phuket to Bangkok, the Austrian foreign ministry said. Malaysian officials are now using CCTV footage to try to identify the two travellers, while investigators are also looking into reports that another two passengers may have been travelling on false documents. Just why the men posing as the Italian and Austrian would have used the false documents is still unclear. Terrorism is a possibility, but so is asylum: six Syrians hoping to seek refugee status in Sweden have been detained for over a month at Phuket&apos;s international airport after attempting to fly to Stockholm via Beijing on Greek passports. Local media outlet Phuketwan reported that the group said they had chosen to fly through Phuket and Beijing because other refugees had reached Sweden using the same flight path. The two men on board MH370 had booked onward flights via Beijing to Amsterdam, and then Copenhagen for the &quot;Italian&quot;, and Frankfurt for the &quot;Austrian&quot;. The two men seem to have purchased their one-way tickets at the same time from a travel agency in the Thai beach town Pattaya on Thursday. Both Kozel&apos;s and Maraldi&apos;s passports had been reported stolen and were listed in Interpol&apos;s database, yet the airline did not cross-check the 40m-record database to confirm whether any passengers on flight MH370 were flying on dubious documents. Terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna from Singapore&apos;s Nanyang Technological University said there were only two categories of travellers using stolen passports: criminals and terrorists. &quot;To blame Malaysian authorities for this is probably unfair \u2013 they have to get it right all the time and potential hijackers just have to get through once,&quot; he added. Malaysia Airlines officials told a press conference on Sunday that terrorism was being investigated as a reason why the plane may have tried to turn back, as reports of potential serious lapses in security at Kuala Lumpur International airport emerged. Just a few months ago, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission and police formed a &quot;flying squad&quot; to address allegations of immigration officers accepting bribes to allow illegal immigrants into the country. At the same time human trafficking gangs were reportedly selling a &quot;Get into Malaysia package&quot; for \u00a3450, in return for which the buyer was smuggled into the country and given a fake &quot;MyKad&quot;, the compulsory identity document for Malaysian citizens. Malaysia&apos;s deputy home minister, Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar, said the government does not deny that &quot;there may be some black sheep among the staff&quot; and added: &quot;Generally, they are good, efficient and honest officers.

Not just the usual chaos of players scurrying through buildings, blasting each other, but peripheral events, too. Gigantic star cruisers float overhead as smaller craft zip around them firing missiles at distant buildings; towering monsters lope across looming alien backdrops, attacking defensive walls; engineering robots make futile attempts to repair damaged facilities. Developer Respawn Entertainment wanted to instil in its multiplayer-only title a sense of narrative cohesion, a feeling that these distant planets exist beyond the frenzied firefights going on in the foreground. And about those fights. In a blogpost last summer, programmer Jon Shiring explained in clear terms the benefits of Microsoft\u2019s \u2018cloud\u2019 platform \u2013 that ethereal marketing construct that has reared its mystical head in every Xbox One publicity drive since last May. Because of the cloud, he said, Titanfall matches won\u2019t have to be hosted by players, which causes all sorts of problems, not least the capacity of the host to cheat or just leave the game, stranding everyone else in the process. Instead, every Titanfall bout will be on a dedicated server, ensuring all players get the same performance, and that the game experience is stable.  It\u2019s a boast that Respawn had to put to the test last month during its Titanfall beta test, which saw the servers opened up to two million players. \u201dWe learned a lot of important lessons,\u201d says Shiring, speaking to the Guardian days after the beta closed. \u201cThe whole point of the beta was to make sure that it scales up well. We completely maxed out every data centre in Europe at one point, and we still had more people who wanted to play so we started to invisibly shuffle them over to east coast US data centres so they could take part. We weren\u2019t planning on doing that but we just thought, well, let\u2019s push it until it breaks. That was our mentality.\u201d  The wisdom of clouds In his blogpost last year, Shiring admitted that the term \u2018cloud computing\u2019 has become almost meaningless, a fancy ad man\u2019s idiom for \u2018a lot of servers\u2019. But with Titanfall is seems, there has been a clear benefit. The game runs on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, a vast infrastructure of severs with a global network of data centres. Microsoft\u2019s business model is to rent space on the platform to web companies and even government agencies needing cloud computing resources, so this is in no way unique to Xbox One: any developer on any machine could run a cloud gaming service via Azure. The advantage for developers, though, is that, according to Shiring, Microsoft is offering access to the platform at a massively reduced rate to game makers. Studios that could never afford to harness Azure or rent their own dedicated worldwide server network, can now get on Microsoft\u2019s.  According to Shiring, the benefits aren\u2019t just about being able to offer dedicated servers, it\u2019s about virtualising the online experience and moving a lot of the processing tasks away from the gamer\u2019s machine \u2013 known as the client \u2013 and toward the server. With a large network of servers available, Respawn is able to seamlessly shift players around when data centres get over-crowded, finding them spaces in other areas. And since the beta, the company has worked out how to track those \u2018orphaned\u2019 players \u2013 people who have been shifted to a more remote centre \u2013 and get them back to their nearest node when things quiten down. \u201dSo, if you\u2019re in Germany you\u2019d rather be on the Amsterdam data server, but we may may move you over to Ireland if the Amsterdam one fills up,\u201d explains Shiring. \u201cAnd since the beta, we now have the knowledge that whenever you search again, you\u2019d really rather be back in Amsterdam. We can invisibly shuffle you back so you get the lower ping.\u201d Virtual worlds Virtualised cloud hosting of this sort has been used for a while in massively-mulitplayer online games, and Mojang employs a similar set-up with its multiplayer hosting service, Minecraft Realms. But using cloud-based or virtualised environments is a really new thing in first-person shooters where latency is much more of an issue. Titanfall is essentially taking the entire multiplayer experience and running it on the server-side - it should mean better in-game performance, smoother matchmaking, and improved social functionality. We\u2019ll need to wait for the launch to see how all this holds up. For Yusuf Mehdi, the chief marketing and strategy officer for Xbox, this is exciting stuff. It is the evidence Microsoft needs that its approach to the cloud is going to deliver results. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled about what Titanfall is doing to showcase the future of gaming on Xbox One,\u201d he told us. \u201cIt takes advantage of the cloud architecture that we\u2019ve built behind Xbox One, which is really new - our Thunderhead servers give you the ability to do a lot of cloud compute, which means very high performance, very fluid games - and in this case a multiplayer world that can operate at incredible performance levels.\u201d Another key benefit of this set up is that Titanfall is able to do all its AI calculations on the server rather than on your console. This has allowed the designers to fill the landscapes with computer-controlled soldiers who get involved in the action, carrying out their own tasks and helping players. It also means that when you call in a Titan, it can function on its own accord until you get into it, either finding its way to you and following you around or guarding one location \u2013 depending on the commands you give it.  Intelligent balance Getting the computer-controlled troopers to the right level of intelligence has been a major balancing issue accroding to Shiring. \u201cEarlier versions were much tougher,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were really formidable, and we\u2019ve dialled it back to the point we think it\u2019s fun. Spectres are harder to fight than the regular guys, but they\u2019re set for fun not for technical prowess - we\u2019re not here to impress everyone with how smart we are at writing AI.  \u201cThe grunts and spectres are there to help out. They\u2019ll capture points for you, they\u2019ll hold and defend points - the spectres will leap a couple of storeys up onto the top of buildings if you\u2019re annoying them. There are a lot of different AI behaviours that are all very tuned. It\u2019s really easy to make AI that just laser beams everyone with headshots - the trick is to make them behave so that they don\u2019t look like an aim bot. They have their own thought processes \u2013 they scan the world, they look for targets, if you listen to their voice chat you\u2019ll hear that they lose sight and call to each other, they\u2019ll call out when you\u2019re approaching them. When you\u2019re in a titan and you come up on one, if they\u2019re a grunt, they\u2019ll get scared and fall to the ground and you can stomp on them, or they\u2019ll run away - there are a lot of different behaviours happening\u201d  \u2022 Titanfall: a complete beginners\u2019 guide  \u2022 Titanfall v Destiny \u2013 how this war will change shooters for ever  Of course, a lot of gamers have questioned the value of filling the battlegrounds with AI characters, especially when human contests are limited to six players versus six, which is a low number compared to titles like Call of Duty and Battlefield. Was Respawn just aiming for a different feel of game when it added the AIs? \u201cI\u2019d love to be able to tell you that we knew exactly what we were making when we started,\u201c laughs Shiring. \u201cHonestly, we just said, let\u2019s try having AI in the world and see what it\u2019s like - we can have them do things the player wouldn\u2019t want to do, we can have interesting fights against them... There was no larger goal, it was just to see how it works.  \u201cAnd they so provide a lot of value. One thing hardcore players don\u2019t think about is that new players want to know where they should be going - and the AI are really good at showing you where the fight is. When you spawn in and see a group of guys with their guns pointed in a certain direction, shouting and firing, it\u2019s really natural for you to think, okay, I\u2019ll head that way. There\u2019s a lot of subtle stuff like that. And if you can stay on the parameter while an AI is capturing and holding a point, suddenly the game is a lot more interesting. We didn\u2019t add them to make up for any shortcomings, we could do whatever we wanted. The AI, the player counts, all these things come together to make a game that hopefully people will want to play.\u201d   Player vs system   According to Shiring, access to a low-cost cloud computing network is going to change the way studios design games. \u201dThe two biggest aspects will be that server CPU and the server bandwidth - that\u2019s what allowed us to make Titanfall,\u201c he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to rely on individual PCs or consoles as your server CPU, basically you\u2019re stealing that resource from the player when you could be using the machine\u2019s processing power to make the game look and play better for them - all that fun stuff. By having that reserve CPU out on the server - and it\u2019s significant, it\u2019s like a two-core machine\u2013 it\u2019s a different philosophy: it becomes, well, lets use what\u2019s there as efficiently as possible and there\u2019s no benefit to not using it - there\u2019s no downside to clients at all, the game just gets better.  \u201cAnd the bandwidth is what lets us have so many moving things in the world - we have the AI running around and the spaceships in the sky, all of this is creating network traffic , but as we\u2019re not bandwidth constrained, it\u2019s not this overwhelming technical task anymore. You can say to the designers, go to town dude, try what you like, and it\u2019s just going to work. We\u2019ve really let the designers go crazy on the game. When you get into that mindset\u2026 people have ideas of what it\u2019s definitely not okay to talk about while designing multiplayer games and a lot of that goes away. We\u2019re pushing the edge right now, but I have a feeling that other people will arrive at the same conclusions we have.\u201d Mehdi is clearly onboard with this idea of computing tasks handled in the cloud ether. \u201dIt\u2019s what we\u2019re most excited about,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the reason behind investing so heavily in getting these Thunderhead cloud servers and building our architecture. A lot of games can now offload compute-intensive tasks to the cloud architecture - we can scale that up and down as needs demand. It allows much master game design, it allows smaller studios to build incredible games because they can use our bandwidth as opposed to having to buy and run their own servers, which is costly and time consuming. I think this is really going to open up the whole open-world concept - the idea of multiplayer gaming in a large environment that\u2019s actually living and changing.\u201d Cloud controversy There are still issues though, and still concerns. Titanfall\u2019s grunts and titans work in a very specific way in a constrained landscape, so it will be interesting to see how other game types utilise server-side AI. Speaking to Eurogamer last year, EA Dice chief Patrick Bach was skeptical about using the cloud in some real-time gaming calculations, calling the concept \u201cgimmick\u201d. \u201cIn practise we\u2019re doing things in real-time,\u201d he told the site, \u201cso you don\u2019t want to send an explosion up to a cloud, calculate it then send the data back down and then it goes poof. We still need to have stuff done in real-time, but I can see other things you could potentially do with it.\u201d  I take this back to Shiring, an ex-member of the Infinity Ward coding team, and ask, really, what are the key differences between working on Titanfall and working on Call of Duty? \u201dHonestly the biggest thing is the ability to rely on dedicated servers because it frees up so much programming time,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the client-side stuff goes away and that\u2019s really gnarly because players can come and go at any time - the sever is the only node in the hub that\u2019s guaranteed to stay there so if you move everything onto the server all the logic becomes really simple, which means we get to spend our time making the game really fun, instead of spending the whole project getting the thing working. It\u2019s not magic, but I got to cut corners - we freed up a lot of programmer time to work on the game rather than the infrastructure.\u201d But what about the future, what about more sophisticated implementations than a multiplayer first-person shooter taking in confined arenas? We talk about the prospect of massively multiplayer, procedurally generated online worlds; the sorts of things Microsoft hyped during the early days of the Xbox One promotional drive. What about games where the world is online and inhabitable and modifiable by thousands at the same time? \u201dThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve seen it in Minecraft obviously, but I\u2019d like to see it in games like ours. And having the servers out there makes this a lot more reasonable to attempt. You can have the server hold an emergent persistent world, save your state and reload it and keep going from there. But cloud computing remains controversial. It\u2019s a concept that, however filled with potential, still concerns those who worry about the ownership of games. With Titanfall, a multiplayer-only title, it sort of makes sense that lots of the computing is done on remote servers, but what happens when single-player adventures start offloading tasks to the cloud? What happens when Microsoft or the publisher shuts those servers? Of course, the concept of \u2019owning\u2019 movies, music and games has become more complex since the dawn of digital distribution, but as more of the control cedes to the corporations and service providers, darker questions are raised. For now though, many developers like Shiring are excited by the potential of this new technological generation \u2013 and it is hard not to be similarly enthused while talking to them. \u201cEveryone is free to make whatever they want now - there aren\u2019t really any massive constraints left,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cWe have lots of ram, lots of CPU cores, so it\u2019s a different mentality to a lot of older engines - all the work is much more evenly spread. It\u2019s up to studios to come up with good ideas. \u201cThat\u2019s more exciting to me than any new rendering or shader tech.

The international police organisation, Interpol, has released an image of the two men, identified as Pouria Nour Mohammad, 19, and Seyed Mohammed Rezar Delawar, 29. They were friends and were hoping to seek asylum in Europe, according to Malaysian officials. &quot;The more information we get, the more we are inclined to conclude it was not a terrorist incident,&quot; said Interpol&apos;s head, Ronald Noble. Nour Mohammad had been using a stolen Austrian passport in an attempt to reach Germany to seek asylum and reunite with his mother, Malaysian police said. His mother was waiting for him in Frankfurt. Delawar was apparently using a stolen Italian passport. Visa requirements have been eased in recent years for Iranian nationals travelling to Malaysia, making the country a popular hub for Iranian tourists, students and those looking for ways to emigrate to Europe. An unnamed Iranian, who met both passengers in Malaysia and went with them to the airport, has spoken to the BBC&apos;s Persian service about the days before their departure. &quot;One of the two was my friend from high school,&quot; he told BBC Persian on Monday\u00a0by phone from Malaysia, apparently referring to Nour Mohammad. &quot;I met him the first day he\u00a0arrived in\u00a0Malaysia \u2026 He said he was staying for three to four days but was eventually going to Germany. His final destination was Frankfurt,&quot; the friend said. Nour Mohammad&apos;s latest posts on Facebook show him in Kuala Lumpur. &quot;Feeling excited,&quot; he wrote as he arrived in Malaysia in late February. In one of his earlier posts, he asked friends to &quot;pray&quot; for him, possibly worried about the risks of travelling on a forged document. According to the friend, Nour Mohammad and Delawar stayed for almost a week in Malaysia before their departure. &quot;We went together to book the flights, and I even had his booking number and was checking his flight status online all the time,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s why I remember which flight he was taking: I had seen his flight number. &quot;I accompanied them to the airport. It was almost 8pm that we headed to the airport, and we arrived around 9pm to 9.15pm at the airport and we stayed in the car for few minutes and chatted.&quot; The friend said he had discovered the pair were planning to travel with stolen passports during the final days of their stay. &quot;The last night before the flight, they both stayed at mine,&quot; he said. &quot;His [Nour Mohammad&apos;s] friend was dying his beard and hair and was checking the colour to match with the picture of a passport. He was making himself look like the photo in the passport,&quot; he told BBC Persian. &quot;When we printed the tickets, I realised that the passports were fake. My friend&apos;s passport belonged to Austria and my friend&apos;s friend had a passport belonging to Italy \u2026 They had three flights to take: from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, from Beijing to \u2013 I think \u2013 Amsterdam, and from Amsterdam my friend was heading to Frankfurt and his friend was going to another country.&quot; He said his friend&apos;s mother had since contacted him and asked him to inform the airline about his forged passport. &quot;His mother told me how he got hold of the fake passport. He had bought the fake passport and wanted to go [to Germany] to seek asylum, and his mother told me his son was travelling with another person. &quot;My last contact with the two was 11.30pm, when they had passed the immigration gate. I wanted to make sure they found their way. They said they were waiting to get on the plane. I have [since the mother&apos;s contact] informed the airline, and this is how I&apos;ve made sure they were aboard the flight.&quot; Khalid Abu Bakar, of the Malaysian national police, said information that had emerged surrounding the two Iranian men diminished the likelihood that terrorism played a role in the plane&apos;s disappearance. &quot;We believe [Nour Mohammad] is not likely to be a member of any terror group and we believe he was trying to migrate to Germany,&quot; he said. Both passports, it has been revealed, were stolen in Thailand. Interpol said they were reported as stolen in the past two years. It was unclear how the Iranians have got their hands on them but it is not the first time Iranian asylum seekers have used forged documents in order to reach Europe. Tickets for the two were reportedly bought in the Thai city of Pattaya, via an Iranian identified by the travel agent Benjaporn Krutnait - owner of Grand Horizon travel - as Mr Ali. There was no suggestion Mr Ali had any links with the forged passports.

The IATI development agenda has been dominated by the needs of big donors and the guidance is only available in English. There are organisations that would like to engage and use the standard, but it&apos;s just too confusing. They need to be better catered for. Show organisations how their data will be used: One of the biggest drivers for publishing that I&apos;ve found is showing organisations how their information may be used. Sites like DfID&apos;s development tracker and Akvo&apos;s open aid search let groups compare their own data with data from other organisations. This helps show the relevance, usefulness and importance of the IATI standard. Resources: Civil society organisations and NGOs that publish to the IATI standard can join the IATI CSO working group, which currently represents users in 14 countries. The Open Development Toolkit has lots of useful information and tools for groups that use IATI data. Joni Hillman, aid transparency programme manager, IATI, London, UK. @JoniHillmanDI @IATI_aid  Tying publishing to funding helps, but it should be more than a box-ticking exercise: The UK Department for International Development has made it a contractual obligation for all NGOs receiving central funds to publish to IATI. We would not have NGOs publishing in such high numbers were it not for DfID&apos;s approach, but many are just ticking the box. The IATI community has a role to sell the benefits of open data and transparency to these organisations and say &quot;while you&apos;re doing this bit of contractual compliance perhaps go the extra mile and get some benefits for yourselves at the same time.&quot; IATI users still want what they&apos;ve always wanted: We&apos;re revisiting the data needs of partner country governments and finding that they still want the same things they did right at the beginning of IATI - timely, comprehensive and forward-looking data on what all aid, development and humanitarian actors are providing in their country. Resource: All those who are publishing to IATI are listed on its registry. Bibhusan Bista, CEO, Young Innovations, Kathmandu, Nepal. @BibhusanBista Raise demand for IATI data within communities: The true essence of publishing to IATI can only be realised if communities are willing and able to analyse and interpret the data, and eventually get engaged in meaningful discussions about it. Resource: Aidstream is a tool to help big and small organisations to publish to IATI. It is targeted at NGOs that intend to publish to IATI but have limited capacity to do so on their own. Steven Flower, IATI analyst, Development Initiatives, Manchester, UK. @stevieflow Validate, validate, validate: There are tools that enable people to test their data against the IATI rules, such as the IATI public validator. This also gives a summary of the file in readable forms. It&apos;s always good to check that the data contains the number of activities, countries and transactions expected. Also, the IATI dashboard is starting to track various data quality metrics on published data. Astrid Jenkinson, programme co-ordinator, Motivation, Manchester, UK Publishing to IATI isn&apos;t easy for small NGOs: From the perspective of a small-to-medium sized NGO, capacity is a challenge. At Motivation we recognise the importance of transparency in our sector, but even with tools like AidStream this is not an easy process. It does take time and resources which often have to be covered through core funds. We upload the data but do not have the time to make use of the rest of the data on the site, so for us it is a bit of a one way information stream. IATI should present its data in different formats: I have been uploading data to IATI for almost a year now but still when I look at other data published, I can&apos;t see what it&apos;s telling me or how it fits into the bigger picture. Graphics that showed aid flows would help demonstrate to smaller organisations, who do engage with these issues regularly, how this information is used and why it is vital to share it. Nicole Valentinuzzi, communications manager, Publish What You Fund, London, UK. @aidtransparency A new tool will help bridge data gaps between donors and those they fund: A new tool is being developed to bridge the remaining gap between IATI data and the budget classifications that recipient governments use. The budget identifier will give two new elements to IATI, an &apos;economic classification&apos; to distinguish between types of expenditure, and a &apos;common code&apos; to match donors&apos; sector codes with codes used by most partner countries in their budgets. This will allow automatic integration of the majority of IATI data with the administrative classifications of a recipient country budget and reduce the amount of manual matching required. Craig Fagan, head of global policy, Transparency International, Berlin, Germany. @craigmfagan Make a business case for publishing data: Publishing to IATI benefits groups in many ways. It allows for better internal efficiencies, and improved quality and accessibility of information. At Transparency International, it helps us to better understand how we are working and how our other mechanisms for accountability are working. IATI needs a feedback loop between donors and recipients: If there is going to be a &apos;transparency revolution&apos;, then there needs to be a two-way-flow of information back from communities and local stakeholders to say firstly whether information is correct \u2013 ie the flows, projects or activities actually reach them \u2013 and secondly, whether the projects and activities are really what are needed. The information game has changed, for all kinds of groups: All stakeholders now expect openness, but what this means for each group is different. Some will want more information that is better visualised, electronic and accessible via websites. Others will want it in analog formats, printed information on what an organisation is delivering or plans to deliver, or community meetings to present their work. Regardless of the format, the aim is the same: to better respond to the obligation we have as organisations to be open and accountable for our activities. Hapee de Groot, programme officer, Hivos, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. @hapeeg Resource: Through the Transparency and accountability initiative we are working with other donors to work on next steps for IATI, and through Making all voices count we try to engage citizens with governments around topics of transparency and accountability.

But sometimes the throng can get too much. Walk on the pavement and you get barged off; take refuge in the road and you get hooted at. Even on the main pedestrian thoroughfares there is little point in trying to walk abreast with your ever-loving. It&apos;s often single file only. So, fight your way from the Spanish Steps down Via Condotti, Via Borghese and Via Marzo to the Pantheon, that remarkable circular temple built by Hadrian in AD 119-128. Thence to Piazza Navona, once used for chariot racing but now filled with rotund, red-faced tourists gawping at the same mediocre paintings you find on the Green Park railings in London on a Sunday. Duck away from the crowds into an alley on the west side of the piazza and make for the 15th-century church of Santa Maria della Pace. Never was a church better named, for here in its enchanting Chiostro del Bramante you will find peace itself. Sit in the delightful cafe on the first floor of this secluded cloister and you will immediately forget you&apos;re near the beating heart of a great, populous city, complete with chaotic crowds and traffic jams. You will be the only foreigner in the cafe and all you will hear is the clink of the ice in your Negroni, the occasional hiss and splutter of the espresso machine and the tinkling laughter of ladies who lunch. Cities will always be noisy, the trick is to accept it and to ferret out a quiet refuge from the din of everyday urban life into which you can retreat when it all gets too much. And once you&apos;ve found it, don&apos;t tell anyone else. If everybody knows about it, it&apos;s not much of a refuge. Other recent discoveries of mine that I&apos;m also happy to share (since I don&apos;t live there) include the Yuen Po Bird Garden in Hong Kong, where tower-block-inhabiting locals rather charmingly take their birds for a walk in little bamboo cages; the Auckland Domain, the vast park created on an extinct volcano in 1840 with sweeping views of New Zealand&apos;s largest city; Kings Park in Perth, with equally fine views of that great city and the Swan river; Havana&apos;s Necr\u00f3polis de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, the marble city-in-miniature, which is the last resting place for 2 million Habanos, and the delightful Royal Botanical Gardens in Madrid, commissioned by Carlos III in the late 18th century, next door to the Prado, and home to an astonishing 1,500 trees, 30,000 plants and flowers and many different birds. These poor birds are also seeking refuge, for they are as sensitive to noise pollution as we are and it is has been proven that high noise levels dramatically reduce the biodiversity of bird life. Indeed, studies have shown that some birds flee cities altogether while others just buckle down and sing louder.     Mount Eden Domain was created on an extinct volcano in 1840, with sweeping views of Auckland. Photograph: PearlBucknall/Alamy    You can have these discoveries on me. I&apos;m afraid, though, that I won&apos;t tell you where my favourite London refuge is, any more than I&apos;ll tell you where my favourite London restaurant is. Sorry, but there it is. I want to keep them to myself, selfish so-and-so that I am. Although no longer a Londoner, I need them too often. I&apos;ll happily tell you my second favourite, though: Pickering Place in SW1. The smallest public square in London and reputedly the site of the capital&apos;s last sword-fighting duel, this gas-lit haven is hidden behind the offices of the wine merchants Berry Bros &amp; Rudd at the bottom of St James&apos;s Street, and it&apos;s as secret and as sweet a spot as you will find in the bedlam that is London&apos;s West End. They recently made St James&apos;s Street a two-way street, the noise and chaos of which only serves to heighten Pickering Place&apos;s blissful quiet, protected as it is by a narrow alleyway and the wine merchants. Cabs, buses, lorries, cars and motorcycles thunder past or, more usually, sit in a fume-laden jam outside, their engines idling, their horns hooting. Traffic, as ever, is the bane of city living and the single biggest cause of urban noise. &quot;The trouble is that people think if you reduce traffic you&apos;ll reduce traffic noise,&quot; says Alistair Meachin, acoustician and founding director of Harmonia Consulting. &quot;Sadly, it&apos;s only true to a certain extent. Studies have shown that, strangely enough, if you increase traffic tenfold, it is only perceived as twice as loud. Therefore if you reduce traffic to a tenth of what it was, that&apos;s to say by 90%, you only halve your perception of noise.&quot; So, even though, say, the congestion charge in London might have resulted in slightly less traffic, the noise levels remain the same? &quot;I&apos;m afraid so, yes,&quot; says Meachin. &quot;The greatest potential for change is the hybrid or electric car. At low speed, the engine of a conventional car is the primary source of noise and this would, of course, disappear immediately if all cars became electric. Traffic jams would become silent. When cars go fast, the dominant noise comes from the wheels on the road or the wind around the car. It can really matter, then, what sort of surface you put down or what sort of tyres the cars have.&quot; Slowing traffic right down in cities helps reduce noise, not by using those futile sleeping policemen, whereby cars simply skid ostentatiously to a halt and then accelerate away and by making motorways through cities seem smaller and more local by clever use of signage and by adding more frequent turnoffs. Other ways to reduce noise pollution include placing noise-absorbent or noise-deflecting barriers by the road or by making greater use of masking sounds such as water features and fountains, or trees that rustle in the wind. The next best thing is to create tranquil areas such as parks or completely pedestrianised streets and squares in which to escape the noise. The commenter Complexe, in the course of the online conversation sparked by the Guardian&apos;s new Cities website, says: &quot;I dream of living in a quiet city \u2026 populated by comparatively quiet types who are required to be ultra-considerate in their noise-making.&quot;     Perth now has an annual festival and plenty of places to see and go, compared to a decade ago. Photograph: Tanya Voltchanskaya    But there&apos;s no such thing as a completely quiet city (Amsterdam and Venice are the closest, I guess, thanks to lots of water and few/no cars). And if there was a completely quiet city, what a ghastly, totalitarian place it would be. Electric cars whooshing silently down the street is one thing (although these can never be truly silent since manufacturers have slowly cottoned on to the fact that they need to add some sort of sound to them), but would roadworks be banned, trains abandoned, aeroplanes diverted, laughter and music in bars and restaurants forbidden? What a hell that would be. Rather like the first time I went to Perth, Australia, only to find it well and truly shut. This was about 10 years ago and there was nobody around, nothing to see and nothing to do. I&apos;m sure I remember tumbleweeds blowing down the deserted, arrow-straight main drag, St George&apos;s Terrace. I was bored to screams and couldn&apos;t wait to leave. I revisited Perth last year and barely recognised the place. The city&apos;s population has grown by 350,000, roughly 25%, since my last visit (due in no small measure to the western Australian mining boom) and it is now a vibrant, crowded, cosmopolitan and trendy spot, thronged with visitors who can&apos;t get enough of its new-found pizzazz. Perth has been almost completely rebuilt and positively bustles, just as Rome does. And this surely is the point of any great city. We should glory in living in a great metropolis or move out. Our feathered friends have the right idea: flee it completely or just sing louder.", "sentences": ["Photograph: Tanya Voltchanskaya    But there&apos;s no such thing as a completely quiet city (Amsterdam and Venice are the closest, I guess, thanks to lots of water and few/no cars)."], "title": "Sounds of the city: one urban traveller's search for silence", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/mar/12/sounds-of-the-city-urban-traveller-serach-silence", "tags": ["Cities", "Urbanisation"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-13T11:30:00Z", "article": "Sir Anthony Eden once spoke the following words, in perfect French: &quot;One who has not suffered the horrors of an occupying power has no right to judge a\u00a0nation that has.&quot; He was referring to France under Nazi occupation. Eden&apos;s sentiment was correct. And yet the question that has been nagging many people since the second world war is why the record of some nations appears to have been so much better than others. Why, for example, did more than 70% of Dutch Jews disappear into the death camps, while almost all the Jews in Denmark managed to get away safely? The relative degree of antisemitism does not offer a conclusive answer. There was anti-Jewish prejudice in both countries, but not, as Isaiah Berlin once nicely put it, &quot;more than necessary&quot;. There was no violence against Jews. A\u00a0reasonably assimilated Jewish middle-class was well established in both nations. Impoverished Jews, many of them in Amsterdam, were less assimilated, but they were not threatened either, until the Germans came. Were the Danes more courageous in\u00a0opposing Nazi plans, or were they simply nicer people \u2013 like the Italians, who also managed to protect a large number of Jews from mass murder? Ranking entire nations in terms of\u00a0niceness is probably an idea to be resisted: societies are too diverse for\u00a0that. But how do we explain the discrepancies, between Holland and Denmark, or Poland, where most Jews were murdered, and Bulgaria, where many survived? Bo Lidegaard, in this magisterial study of wartime Denmark, claims that his country&apos;s admirable record owes much to the way Danish citizens saw themselves and their society. He writes: &quot;The Danish exception shows that the mobilisation of civil society&apos;s humanism and protective engagement is not only a theoretical possibility: It can be done. We know because it happened.&quot; The harming of Denmark&apos;s Jews went against everything most Danes believed in, especially their concept of\u00a0the rule of law. Even injustice, he writes, &quot;needs a semblance of law. That is hard to find when the entire society denies the right of the stronger.&quot; The story he tells of how Danes, from the top bureaucrats, Church leaders and police officials down to the humblest fishermen, helped the Jews escape when the Germans tried to deport them to concentration camps in\u00a0October 1943, is indeed astonishing and heart-warming. From the moment they knew it was coming, Danish government officials made it clear to their policemen that no\u00a0help was to be given to the Germans. Doors were opened everywhere, often to complete strangers, for Jews to hide. Fishermen living along the rugged Danish coast loaded their cutters and schooners with thousands of refugees and ferried them across to Sweden. They were often generously paid for taking the risk. But penniless Jews, who had fled from eastern Europe or were members of the Danish working class, were never rejected. And all this was openly supported by King Christian. He did not, contrary to popular myth, ride his horse through Copenhagen wearing the Star of David, but he did make it clear, as he wrote in his diary, that he considered &quot;our own Jews to be Danish citizens, and the Germans could not touch them&quot;. The Dutch Queen Wilhelmina may have felt the same way about Jews in her country, but she never stated it as openly as her Danish colleague, even from her safe base in wartime London. The humanism of the Danish rescuers, and their king, is not in doubt. Helping people in mortal danger was a matter of common decency, which was not always in such abundant supply in other parts of Europe. Again and again, Lidegaard turns to a political explanation: &quot;Danish democracy mobilised itself to protect the values on which it was based.&quot; To the fisherfolk, according to Lidegaard, it was also a matter of local honour. A school consultant told his fellow citizens in a coastal village from which many Jews managed to escape: &quot;History will be written these days in this town.&quot; However, there is no reason to think that the Dutch, or the Norwegians, or the Belgians, were any less attached to their democratic institutions or their idea of the rule of law. To observe, as Lidegaard does, that Denmark benefited from circumstances that were substantially different from those\u00a0in other countries under Nazi occupation, does not detract from the moral courage of Danish citizens, but does help explain some of the discrepancies in Europe. First, there were very few Jews in Denmark, about 6,000, compared to about 140,000 in Holland, and more than 3 million in Poland. Most of them\u00a0were so assimilated as to be indistinguishable from other Danes. Also, it was relatively easy to escape to neighbouring Sweden, which was not under German occupation. And neutral Sweden, realising by 1943 that the Third Reich was in retreat, welcomed the Jewish refugees. This act of humanity was boosted, perhaps, by a\u00a0desire to show that Sweden would be on the winning side. The most important factor, however, was the highly ambivalent attitude of the Germans themselves. Unlike Sweden, Denmark was not free from Nazi occupation, but a special deal had been struck. Hitler wanted Denmark to be his model protectorate. Like the Swedes, the Danes would supply the Reich with agricultural goods and other economic assistance. They would crack down on domestic resistance. And in return, they retained their own government, as well as their cherished democratic institutions. Holland, by contrast, was under direct Nazi rule; its government had fled to London in 1940, along with the\u00a0Queen. Much of France was still administered by a French government, which was neither liberal, nor democratic. Central European countries were either annexed by the\u00a0Reich or ruled by Nazi governors. Swedish neutrality and the Danish deal with Nazi Germany were not heroic. But these arrangements provided the necessary flexibility to do the right thing. In a way, it was precisely their unheroic accommodation that allowed them to behave decently. As long as the Germans remained keen to\u00a0keep Denmark as a somewhat autonomous protectorate, it was not in their interest to agitate the Danes. And the Danes made it very plain that any attempt to deport the Jews would agitate them very much. It also helped that the decision to attack the Jews in Denmark came late \u2013 in 1943 \u2013 and suddenly. There was no gradual isolation of the Jewish population through cumulative measures, which often met with relatively little protest in other occupied countries: the barring from certain jobs or public places, the yellow star, and so on. Also, by 1943, even some of the fiercest Nazi officials were becoming a\u00a0little nervous about the possible consequences of what they were doing in case the Reich should collapse. This would explain the two-faced and oddly equivocal actions of the top Nazi official in Denmark, SS General Werner Best, and of his chief German adviser, Georg Duckwitz, who told the Danes exactly when and where the attack on\u00a0the Jews would take place. At that stage, relations between Nazi Germany and its model protectorate were in a delicate phase anyway, because the elected Danish government had already resigned in protest against the imposition of martial law. If the Danish bureaucrats who continued to administer the country were to quit as well, the German-Danish deal would break down, which would not only mean a loss of face in Berlin, but also hinder the steady supply of Danish goods to the Reich. That is why Werner Best assured his boss, Heinrich Himmler, that he would take care of the Jewish problem in Denmark, while at the same time hinting to the Danes that he would limit the scope of the deportations. He may even have been complicit in Duckwitz&apos;s tip-off about the impending action, which allowed most Jews to go into hiding. What is sure is that neither the German army, nor the navy, nor even Nazi officials in Denmark, apart from a few zealots, did very much to stop the boats from ferrying their loads of refugees to Swedish ports. Lidegaard is right: &quot;The special Danish example cannot be used to reproach others who experienced the German occupation under far worse conditions than Denmark.&quot; But the Danes made the very best out of their easier circumstances. And for that, they should always be remembered as an example of civility at a time when there was precious little of it. \u2022 Ian Buruma&apos;s most recent book is Year Zero: A History of 1945.", "sentences": ["Impoverished Jews, many of them in Amsterdam, were less assimilated, but they were not threatened either, until the Germans came."], "title": "Countrymen: The Untold Story of How Denmark's Jews Escaped the Nazis - review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/13/countrymen-untold-story-denmark-jews-escaped-nazis-bo-lidegaard-review", "tags": ["History", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-13T12:28:00Z", "article": "     Reading on mobile?

Here\u2019s some of rock music\u2019s most famous fights: Anton Newcombe v everyone Anton Newcombe could start a fight in a nunnery. A nunnery run by kittens. But this particular scrap usurps the many vitriolic words the Brian Jonestown Massacre frontman has hurled at journalists and bandmates throughout his career: featured in the climactic scene of rockumentary Dig!, what starts out as Newcombe against the fans slowly unfurls into a all-out inter-band brawl, kicking off with the gurny-faced Joel Gion and ending with a sprawling mess on the floor.

Charlie Watts v Mick Jagger Bill German, founder of the Beggars Banquet fanzine, famously described a meeting in Amsterdam to discuss whether the Stones should call it a day. At one point, he reported, Jagger foolishly called Watts \u201cmy drummer\u201d. According to German, Jagger said something to Watts along the lines of: \u201cNone of this should matter to you because you\u2019re only my drummer.\u201d \u201c[Watts] kept it bottled inside until he got back to his hotel room,\u201d German later wrote. \u201cHe then clicked off his TV, put on his shoes, walked down the hall and knocked on Mick\u2019s door. When the lead singer of the Rolling Stones opened it, his drummer clocked him on the jaw. Charlie then turned round and calmly walked away.\u201d Well, at least he knocked.   Kid Rock v Tommy Lee  It\u2019s a tale as old as time: boy meets girl; girl marries boy; girl and boy divorce. Then, girl marries similarly oily haired rocker before filing for subsequent divorce.

The midfielder had taken a call from his agent at his Portuguese villa, five minutes up the road from the swish coastal resort of Cascais where the sun beat down, his young family were settled and his position within the Benfica setup had long since felt integral. His representative was phoning to confirm Chelsea, a club who had considered him surplus to requirements a few years earlier, were keen to lure him back to the drizzle and chill of a London winter. The response was immediate. &quot;We spoke for one minute, that was it,&quot; the Serb recalls. &quot;I knew what was best for me. I had no doubts about coming back.&quot; And that was that. There were apparently no tentative enquiries as to what he might hope to earn second time round at Stamford Bridge. No request for his agent to seek assurances the player would be granted more first-team chances should he return to the Premier League. Not even, and perhaps most perilously, a pause to deliberate with his wife over a return to England. Matic, a youngster of promise plucked from Kosice just as Middlesbrough signalled their interest, had barely been sighted in a first spell in this country that had technically stretched to two years but had yielded only three cameos amounting to 65 minutes of senior football. Those games had been won 4-0, 5-0 and 8-0 but the substitute had been competing alongside team-mates whose work was done, and against broken men. He knew he still had a reputation to forge on these shores. Two months into his second coming and, already, the reasons the Serb had been targeted by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as a mid-season priority are already clear. The 25-year-old is a changed man from the rather callow, wiry youth who had once aspired to be Chelsea&apos;s playmaking No10. These days he is physically imposing, toughened up by two and a half years spent competing at the top end of the Portuguese league, with class and progression in his passing and aggression in his tackling. He is unrecognisable from the youngster who had been loaned to Vitesse Arnhem back in the summer of 2010 and then, mid-season, used as a makeweight in the \u00a323.5m deal that brought David Luiz from the Est\u00e1dio da Luz. Indeed, he established just how far he has come on his first Premier League start, at the Etihad Stadium in early February, when the \u00a321m signing had eclipsed Yaya Tour\u00e9 on enemy territory as Chelsea issued their most eye-catching statement of intent yet. Somewhere at Cobham, questions will have been asked as to why the Serb had been permitted to depart almost as an afterthought three years ago. Certainly, the Benfica coach, Jorge Jesus, had spied something in the youngster \u2013 perhaps physique and comfort in possession \u2013 others had missed with the Portuguese club having stipulated Matic&apos;s release was key to their sanctioning the David Luiz deal. &quot;When I arrived at Benfica I&apos;d been playing like a No10 in the team, but the first thing the coach did was tell me: &apos;You are going to be a defensive midfielder here,&apos;&quot; he says. &quot;He thought I could play better in that position, so I worked every day with him to improve tactically, and trained hard physically. I&apos;d stay every day after training doing work alone in the gym and, with these two things together, I&apos;ve improved. &quot;It wasn&apos;t easy because I&apos;d never played that position before. At the start, to be honest, I didn&apos;t do well there but Jorge Jesus believed in me. He believed in my quality and kept saying: &apos;Just do what I ask and, slowly, you will play better and better.&apos; That is what happened. I&apos;d watch DVDs of other defensive midfielders to see how they moved, and I worked closely with Javi Garc\u00eda, who was at Benfica at that time. He already knew what the coach wanted, so that helped my education. It took a few months, but I got there. Benfica always play to attack: they feel they can win every game in the Portuguese league, so when we didn&apos;t have the ball I&apos;d always try to [regain it] and set up a counterattack quickly. I enjoyed it. &quot;I am different now. I&apos;d first come to Chelsea from Kosice and, for me, that was a dream. It&apos;s not easy making that move. I was maybe the first player to come from Slovakia to a club like Chelsea, who normally buy players from Holland, Spain, Italy, Portugal \u2026 I was 20 and it was an experience, but there were big players here in my position: Ballack, Lampard, Essien in the best moment of his career, and I was out injured for four months as well. It&apos;s tough for young players to play in the Premier League anyway. So when there was the chance to play at Vitesse, that was important. That&apos;s also why I chose to go to Benfica, because it was a chance to improve myself by playing. They&apos;re a big club, with six million fans in Portugal alone, so it helped me develop as a player and as a person. But this was the right moment to play in the Premier League again. I feel I am prepared now to do well here. It&apos;s the best moment in my career.&quot; His timing is in this time round. Matic was part of a Benfica team who had been nearly men during his spell at the club, a team twice pipped by Porto to the league title, and by Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es in the Portuguese Cup. The 2012 League Cup was his only honour, with Chelsea having inflicted their own heartache in Amsterdam last May. The Europa League final had been tied at 1-1 deep into stoppage time when Matic&apos;s compatriot and close friend, Branislav Ivanovic, rose to head in Juan Mata&apos;s corner and claim the trophy. &quot;I sent him a message after the game saying he has such a big head, and that&apos;s why he&apos;d scored,&quot; says the midfielder, speaking at the launch of the Puma evoPOWER 1 football boots. &quot;This is football. I&apos;d prefer to have forgotten that match \u2026 But Branislav is a good man, someone who has helped me a lot the first time I was here.&quot; Matic recently suggested the right-back is Serbia&apos;s answer to David Beckham, in terms of popularity if not good looks, though both players give Mourinho&apos;s current first-choice team an edge. The victory at City set a standard and pepped conviction within this squad that the title could actually be claimed for the first time since 2010, when a young Matic had emerged from the bench against Wigan with 20 minutes of the season remaining and the hosts already 6-0 up. They would score twice more before the end. The lead at the top going into Saturday&apos;s game at Aston Villa stands at seven points from Liverpool and Arsenal, who both play on Sunday, and an imposing nine from City even if Manuel Pellegrini&apos;s side have three games in hand. The coming weeks will determine whether they can be held off. &quot;But this Chelsea is more confident, certainly than the team Benfica played in the Europa League final,&quot; the Serb adds. &quot;We play better football and, at this moment, are playing well. We may not be favourites but, as Wigan showed against City in the FA Cup, in football favourites do not always win. You never know what will happen. But I do know being here will help me. My wife and son cried when we left Portugal, but I had to move. I want to improve, to play good football in a top league. This is what I am doing now under the best coach in the world.&quot; Nemanja Matic wears the Puma evoPOWER 1, the perfect combination of power and accuracy inspired by barefoot kicking.

Take The Bunker in New York, London&apos;s Fabric or Liverpool&apos;s Nation (to name just a few): these are spaces that weather the storm of hard times and changing tastes, and see droves of clubbers flock to bounce off their sweaty, well-worn walls. Amsterdam&apos;s Trouw is one such club. However, next year sees its untimely closure and European clubbers are already in mourning. It&apos;s fitting then that another institution, Sub Club&apos;s Saturday night residency, is to host Trouw regulars Young Marco and Olaf Boswijk.

In recent years, large numbers of these middle-aged men and women have been trying to make sense of their backgrounds, which have sometimes been obscured, especially where their parents have been unable to talk about their experiences. In Rita Goldberg, a teacher of comparative literature at Harvard University, they have found a new voice to cheer their quest. At a recent London reading of her mother&apos;s biography, Motherland, Rita, 64, was unprepared for the strength of the audience response. &quot;I was startled by it and am beginning to see how many of my generation were defined by their parents&apos; history, even though they did not live through it.&quot; The need for the children of survivors to understand the origins of their own demons, is, she believes, fuelling research into their traumatic family histories. &quot;People came up to me in tears \u2013 and recognition. I met the daughter of a survivor of the Warsaw ghetto, whose father refused ever to talk about it and insisted she had no right to ask questions. He said it was nonsense that she should have a part of his history, since his life and hers were separate. It was his way of coping with the past.&quot; One can understand both views. Despite the horrific nature of the survivors&apos; wartime experiences, it is surely unreasonable to expect their children not to delve into that past, especially when it is declared taboo. Yet how justifiable is it for the postwar\u00a0generation to claim, like Goldberg, that their parents&apos; history also belongs to them? Those questions lie at the heart of Goldberg&apos;s history of her German-born mother, Hilde Jacobsthal \u2013 now 89 and diagnosed with Alzheimer&apos;s \u2013 and its lasting influence on herself and her two younger sisters, whose own experiences inform part of the memoir. Much of the material comes from her youngest sister Dottie&apos;s recorded interviews with their mother about her early life, which Goldberg describes as: &quot;A huge effort, emotional and difficult for us all.&quot; It was especially difficult for their middle sister, Susie, who perceived her parents&apos; past as dominating their lives; she refused initially to discuss the transcribed tapes. Goldberg admits she wrote the book partly to confront her own demons. &quot;I&apos;m not sure it helped, but I never wanted to remove or exorcise these ghosts. They belong to me. I only wanted to examine and understand my relationship to them.&quot; The narrative of her mother&apos;s many near miss escapes from the Gestapo, reads like a film script. The Jacobsthal family left Germany for Holland in 1929 for economic reasons. In Amsterdam, they became close friends of Otto Frank and his daughters. Margot Frank and Hilde, both 12, were classmates and close friends: Margot&apos;s sister, eight year-old Anne, often tagged along, eager to join in. When the Franks disappeared overnight after Germany occupied Holland in 1940, Hilde&apos;s family assumed they had fled to Switzerland. Only after the war did\u00a0Hilde learn that they had been hiding nearby.     Rita and her sister Susie with their mother, Hilde, and Otto Frank and his wife Fritzi, right, in 1958. Otto, father of Anne Frank, was Rita's godfather.      Trained as a nurse in 1941, Hilde worked in a creche, the uniform protecting her from danger to some extent. Even at 16, she possessed an &quot;almost comic&quot; self-confidence. Once,\u00a0hiding with a non-Jewish family, the Gestapo knocked at the door: Hilde put on her uniform and remonstrated with them for forgetting that the flat was in quarantine following a reported case of diphtheria. Working opposite a theatre used by the Germans as a round-up centre for Jewish deportees, Hilde rescued some people, grabbing and steering them through the streets to the nearest underground station where they vanished into the crowd. She even pulled her parents off a deportation truck several times. But one day, Hilde got back after work to find that their home had been looted. The door bore a Nazi seal and her parents had been deported. She never saw them again. Her brother, Jo, working with the Belgian underground, smuggled Hilde into Belgium where she remained a fugitive for 18 months. This, too, was touch and go. Forced to swim half a mile across the river Maas into Belgium, balancing her clothes on her head and supporting her brother, paralysed by cramp, she outwitted the German border patrol&apos;s dogs and searchlights. Staying one step ahead of the Nazis, she frequently changed her appearance, name, nationality, language, religion and age, using false papers supplied by the resistance. She became, says Goldberg, &quot;an experienced escape artist&quot;, fleeing unsafe lodgings and Nazi sympathisers, squeezing out of attic windows, running across rooftops at night, hiding beneath stores of hay and vegetables in farmers&apos; trucks under the noses of the Germans. Fluent in German, Dutch, French and English, and blessed like her brother with fearlessness and a quick wit, she convincingly swapped one identity for another, becoming a blonde 24-year-old member of the Dutch Reformed Church one week, a devout French-speaking Catholic the next, attending Sunday mass and saying the rosary with the other women. Goldberg believes that the innocent young Hilde Jacobsthal was lost for ever at that point. &quot;The culmination of intense emotion and physical strain became the foundation of a new personality in my mother.&quot; That personality was energetic, cheerful and outgoing, but Goldberg sensed her mother&apos;s capacity for joy hid a wound too deep to heal. &quot;Learning to build a wall and compartmentalise pain and conflict helped her to survive but created a remoteness that distanced her, even from us. She buried a part of herself so deep it remains impenetrable.&quot; Goldberg at one stage went through periods of depression, consumed by\u00a0&quot;a\u00a0vague gloom, like some sort of auto-immune disorder&quot;. As the eldest child, she felt the pressure to be responsible and protective towards her mother. &quot;The history was a crushing burden and has to some extent paralysed me.&quot; The origins of that burden are self-evident. Her mother returned to nursing after the war and joined the British Red Cross in April 1945. Intent on finding her parents, she volunteered to work in Bergen-Belsen. When she arrived at the liberated camp, 13,000 decomposing corpses were unburied; 60,000 inmates, barely alive, were dying at the rate of 400-1,000 a day. After begging to be allowed\u00a0to look for her parents, Goldberg was the only woman permitted to enter the notorious &quot;Horror Camp One&quot;. Separating the living from the dead and dying, she searched faces distorted by pain and emaciation, unable to discern any remnant of human personality. Her worst fear was of not being able to recognise her parents if she found them.     Hilde, left, leading a children's exercise class at Belsen, c1946.    Finding out that they, as well as Margot and Anne Frank and Mrs Frank, had been murdered, she knew she had lost everything: her parents, name, language, country, home and official identity. Belsen became her home for two years. Joining the American Joint Distribution Committee, she dressed in a US uniform and oversaw the rehabilitation of survivors, including the immigration of 70 Hungarian children to Palestine. As Belsen became the largest displaced persons camp in Europe, some semblance of a community miraculously evolved: there were dances, theatre performances; exiles fell in love, got married, had children, held religious services. Hilde&apos;s good looks and vitality attracted many boyfriends and in 1946 she met her future husband, Swiss-born Dr Max Goldberg, Belsen&apos;s public health officer. In 1950, Max and Hilde emigrated to the US with 10-month-old Rita.     Rita Goldberg: 'We were measured against our grandparents\u2019 martyrdom and our parents\u2019 exceptional courage.' Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    For the Goldbergs, staying silent about the past was never an option. As a confident extrovert and mimic, Hilde thrived on storytelling. As Goldberg observes: &quot;Her history has what Joseph Conrad called glamour, a hypnotic magic that has transfixed succeeding generations as well as her own. Adventure, danger and strong personalities \u2013 this is the tale listeners want to hear. My sisters and I began to think that our parents&apos; self-confidence extended to a kind of bragging about their past, and often about us as well, as if we were golden examples of their successful survival. This may be true of other children of charismatic parents.&quot; The spotlight fell on them for other reasons. After the war, Hilde was reunited with Otto Frank, who regarded her as his surrogate daughter. To Hilde, Otto was like a father, and he became Rita&apos;s godfather and legal guardian of Hilde&apos;s daughters. The Goldberg daughters felt that they could never do as much with their lives as their parents had. &quot;We were measured against our grandparents&apos; martyrdom on the one hand and our parents&apos; exceptional courage on the other. And we failed abjectly to live up to that sublime standard.&quot; Goldberg believes she lacks the qualities necessary for survival, a conviction that has influenced everything she has done. It was also difficult for the three sisters to handle their teenage moods. &quot;We were ashamed even to acknowledge anger or anxiety. Those emotions felt somehow unworthy.&quot; Ultimately, writing her mother&apos;s story turned out to be liberating for Goldberg. &quot;By narrating her story, I have found my voice. It is helping all of us move forward.&quot; \u2022 Rita Goldberg will read at Waterstones, Hampstead, London NW3, at 7pm on 18 March \u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2014 to correct Rita Goldberg&apos;s age.", "sentences": ["In Amsterdam, they became close friends of Otto Frank and his daughters."], "title": "The trauma of second-generation Holocaust survivors", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/15/trauma-second-generation-holocaust-survivors", "tags": ["Family", "Holocaust", "Second world war", "Biography", "Books", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-16T00:05:29Z", "article": "It&apos;s the big, nagging question that journalists obsess over. Should people pay for news on the web? Does free news website access mean booming audience figures or bust? Plus, emerging from the same forest as licence fee renewal time approaches: could the BBC survive behind a subscription\u00a0wall? You can hear Andrew Neil and a team of experts hunt for answers at a special London Press Club/YouGov night in the British Library this Tuesday. But don&apos;t expect crisp conclusions. This is work in bemusing process. Mike Darcey, head regent of Wapping, proclaims ever more vehemently that the hard, impervious paywalls prescribed for him by Rupertian edict &quot;are the only sensible way&quot; \u2013 and, conversely, that the free, non-subscription models espoused by the likes of the Mail and Guardian mean a short ride to Poverty Row. But anyone can change sides in this argument (and many do so frequently, particularly in America). The Boston Globe has just dismantled its hard Wapping-style paywall and chosen a more flexible, metered model instead. The Dallas Morning News has knocked down its own purpose-built wall and opted for &quot;an image-oriented, collage display&quot;. And, of course, John Paton, America&apos;s most eloquent apostle of &quot;digital first&quot;, has decided that his Journal Register chain must try to raise subscription cash after all. These examples are just a small illustration of the widespread uncertainty that prevails \u2013 and of a range of possible courses that seems to grow wider by the month. Here&apos;s Newsweek, once a mighty US weekly, opening up again under new ownership. But, crucially, who do they get to run their digital subscriptions? A four-year-old outfit, Piano Media from Slovakia, that has swiftly become Europe&apos;s biggest portal moneymaker, used by 25 major publishers and now with its first foothold in the States. Combine Piano&apos;s expertise with an even newer competitor, Blendle in Amsterdam, and the table of possibilities is overflowing. If you&apos;re an entire newspaper and magazine industry \u2013 in Slovakia, Poland, the Netherlands \u2013 you can build a single-access paywall around everything, with a range of inner walls that can provide individual opportunities: to which Blendle, in particular, adds social media connections as a self-proclaimed &quot;iTunes of journalism&quot;. Put such operations together, and there&apos;s a new answer to the problem of why newspaper print sales have fallen so steeply over the last decade: because, especially in Britain, purchasing of a second or third daily paper each day \u2013 or each week \u2013 has declined to vanishing point. Price escalation has ruined that game; and so, digitally, has the necessity to register for a whole variety of services using a whole variety of passwords. But now that&apos;s a problem solved online, at least at a cost. Technology and ingenuity pound along. Should people pay for news on the web? It sounds a no-brainer when YouGov asks. Somebody has to pay. And, of course, people who want precious, specific information will always find ways to pay for it somehow. The difficulty \u2013 for bog-standard BBC programmes sustained by bog-standard licence fees and bog-standard court cases, just as much as bog-standard print news coverage \u2013 is what happens to the rest. Subscription technocrats can cook up any dish that suits. The BBC iPlayer could mount a clone of Netflix in a trice. Papers can fine-tune and constantly find fresh paths. But the basic, inescapable human problem remains.

In their midst a brass band plays on, leading, guiding, giving hope. The images are black and white, peopled by successive generations. This month marks the 30th anniversary of the start of the 1984-85 miners&apos; strike. Unless you already know about The Miners&apos; Hymns, you may not have heard of the composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, or be sure which Bill Morrison created the sequence of archive footage described above. The strange counterpoint between an Icelandic minimalist, an American film-maker and a bitter episode in recent British history has resulted in a work as unclassifiable as it is unforgettable. The Miners&apos; Hymns, produced by Forma Arts, mourns and celebrates a lost industrial past. The pitheads of the north and north-east, most of them, have been grassed over. The contours of a way of life remain indelible. Morrison&apos;s film with live music for brass band and string quartet was first seen in 2010 in Durham Cathedral, part of the annual Durham miners&apos; gala. A screen version, with recorded music, followed in 2011. In 2012 Alex Ross of the New Yorker, among others, called it the best film score of the year. Since then, The Miners&apos; Hymns has become a phenomenon. Nearly 40 screenings, mostly in ex-mining communities but in America and Amsterdam too, have taken place since last summer. Coinciding with the anniversary of the strike, three climactic live performances happened this month. Two were in the north-east: at the Sage, Gateshead and at the social welfare centre in Easington, the Durham colliery town at the centre of the strike, where Billy Elliot was filmed, and a focus of Bill Morrison&apos;s archive material. The last, its London premiere, was at the Barbican.            Whatever the reason people chose to go \u2013 roots, politics, curiosity, above all a love of brass band music \u2013 the place was packed. The irony of the building&apos;s proximity to the City, its modern identity so much shaped in the 1980s, will have been lost on no one. How different from the Sage and in Easington, where many in the audience knew the relevant landscape intimately, and where some were watching their parents or grandparents or, in a few cases, their younger selves on screen. Anthony Sargent, director of the Sage, told me: &quot;It was almost unbearably painful. We&apos;ve done many events here that tell regional stories, but I cannot remember an evening as searingly charged with raw emotion as this.&quot; Another audience member said: &quot;There was weeping, there was the spontaneous laughter of recognition; and very touchingly a large number of older people who may have been in some of the later film clips could be heard explaining things to younger friends as the event proceeded.&quot; At Easington \u2013 which one of the musicians said was the most moving experience of all \u2013 there was a standing ovation. The atmosphere at the Barbican was restrained in comparison, yet still electrifying and intense. The specially chosen brass ensemble \u2013 including members of the NASUWT Riverside Band, for whom the piece was written \u2013 with the composer at the sound controls and his regular musical partners, the Iskra String Quartet and the conductor Gudni Franzson, performed on stage in front of the big screen. J\u00f3hannsson (b.1969) is mostly associated with experimental, drone and film music. He spills into different categories including pop and rock. Having heard some of The Miners&apos; Hymns soundtrack when it was new, without seeing the film, I found it slow, fuzzy and repetitive, lacking the marching themes and rhythms that make British band music so irresistible. I was mistaken. J\u00f3hannsson has written, as the title indicates, wordless hymns in praise and lament. Their purpose is to serve as well as partner Morrison&apos;s images. Seeing the two together gave the music a depth, value and, in all the dark, electronic rumblings, a cumulative grandeur. As a lesson in the power of film music, seeing The Miners&apos; Hymns was basic and startling. When the (entirely silent) film showed police horses confronting the grim-faced striking workforce, the sheer volume and unfurling of the music made sense. A decorative solo trumpet line swirled and circled like a gleaming mechanical bird around the monumental edifice of the remainder. When film and music ended, the silence was long and heartfelt.            This was outside the usual sound world of British brass bands, hardly written about in classical review columns except when they play Elgar or premiere a work by a composer usually heard in the concert hall. Yet this amateur movement continues to tug at the national heartstrings. The occasion of the miners&apos; strike anniversary has renewed interest and headlines, not always harmoniously. A planned stage version of the 1996 film Brassed Off caused fury by inviting the Durham Constabulary Brass Band to play. As Davey Hopper of the Durham Miners&apos; Association observed: &quot;We were going to have the men who truncheoned us down and destroyed our communities now playing music for us.&quot; Last week the MP for Shipley Philip Davies pointed out that opera received \u00a3347m from the Arts Council over the past five years compared with \u00a31.8m for brass bands. His comments were interpreted as meaning opera is for southern &quot;luvvies&quot;, brass bands for northern working classes. Neither is true. Think of the Hackney Colliery Band, an east London hip-hop-jazz-funk marching band that played at the London 2012 Olympics closing ceremony. Last weekend 77 ensembles from Devon, Cornwall, Somerset and the like entered the West of England Regional Brass Band Championships in Torquay. To borrow the title of an album made by 11 collaborating bands in 2010, the same year as The Miners&apos; Hymns premiere, &quot;the music lives on now the mines have gone&quot;. Meanwhile we import our coal from Ukraine. The comfort and inspiration of a brass band may be needed there as never before.", "sentences": ["Nearly 40 screenings, mostly in ex-mining communities but in America and Amsterdam too, have taken place since last summer."], "title": "The Miners' Hymns review \u2013 a rich seam of music and mine", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/16/the-miners-hymns-barbican-review-morrison-johansson", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "The miners' strike 1984-85"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-16T09:00:00Z", "article": "This week we discussed the role of councils in sustainable transport and this is what our experts had to say: 1) Let&apos;s think big: congestion charging whole cities and abolishing one way systems  Until council&apos;s start thinking a lot bigger we will only nibble around the edges and fail to promote sustainable transport. Thinking bigger means things such as congestion charging for the whole city, abolishing one way systems, closing off rat running streets and demolishing and replacing them with parks city centre motorways, widening footpaths and creating networks of segregated bike paths.  \u2013 John Whitelegg is visiting professor of sustainable transport at Liverpool John Moores University. 2) What sustainable transport options are there?  As long as we build more roads and more car parks and encourage large new traffic generating developments we will make things worse. If we look around the world we can see excellent examples of what does work \u2013 Portland (Oregon) has trams and high quality public realm; Freiburg (Germany) has excellent walking and cycling facilities.  \u2013 John Whitelegg 3) Other great examples from abroad ...   \u2022 Perth in Western Australian with its newish urban rail system and steering development round some of the stations. \u2022 Seoul in Korea with a total demolition and removal of an ugly city centre freeway (good idea for Liverpool). \u2022 Bogota in Columbia with many car free days and a 17km new cycle and walking route, which is car free, to encourage active travel. \u2022 Swedish fossil fuel free road transport and a decarbonised road transport system. \u2022 Zurich and Basel with excellent, highly connected bus and tram systems that provide a better option than a car.  \u2013 John Whitelegg 4) Improved transport can have positive effects on health and the environment  Sustainable transport needs to prove its worth to local authorities and central government as now it competes for funding sources with other areas such as health and education. There is an important message to get across that transport is cross-cutting in its nature and can have positive effects on health, climate change, education and access, therefore saving money in other areas.  \u2013 Andrew Hugill is director of policy and technical affairs at the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation 5) We don&apos;t have a clear, long term, vision of infrastructure needs in the UK  At various points over the past few weeks I&apos;ve spoke to council chief executives and transport directors who bemoan the lack of vision for what our network might look like in 20 years time. Not just this, but how are we discouraging travel? What I mean by this is, if our roads are congested, maybe the answer is not more roads, but fewer reasons to get in the car and travel. Broadband infrastructure and all the digital possibilities that come with it are essential.  \u2013 Steven Howell is director of policy and research at local government thinktank Localis. 6) Amsterdam and Copenhagen are usually mentioned for their high cycling rate  Following from the comments on understanding citizens&apos; behaviour and finding new ways to encourage sustainable transport, a really interesting initiative is Copenhagen&apos;s Smart Wheel. It&apos;s a wheel unit that can be attached to the bicycles, turning it into a hybrid. So people don&apos;t have to spend that much effort on cycling \u2013 maybe a major reason why people don&apos;t like to sweat on their way to work, or can&apos;t cycle because of health issues. It was developed in partnership with MIT. So finding the barriers towards the take up of those modes and trying to tackle them in innovative ways is an important thing to do.  \u2013 Nada Nohrov\u00e1 is a researcher for the Centre for Cities. 7)There are three key roles for local authorities   Leadership: an obvious one really, but should always be kept in mind and highlighted. The city needs a clear vision and someone to take it forward. Michael Bloomberg, Georges Ferguson or Boris Johnson are all examples of this. Information: Is transport the main carbon emitter? Or is it buildings? What potential effect might cycling initiatives have? Networks: I think that the power of local authorities to build networks is much understated. Councils, if nothing else can act as enablers by coordinating priorities, bringing people together, identifying challenges to green investment and helping businesses address bureaucratic barriers.  \u2013 Nada Nohrov\u00e1  8) Do we need an integrated transport authority for regions in the UK?  In Bristol, mayor George Ferguson isn&apos;t able to do as much as he&apos;d like because Bristol city council doesn&apos;t cover a wide area, and he&apos;s dependent on working with other councils who might not be supportive. A more sensibly sized integrated transport authority that covered the whole region and was able to work in a more integrated way (like Transport for London or Transport for Greater Manchester) would be able to plan and fund things more effectively, we think.   \u2013 Sian Berry is a campaigner on roads and sustainable transport 9) Traffic stats have been overestimated since the 1980s  A really big barrier to getting better [sustainable transport] projects funded and something that perpetuates the calls for new roads, which is even happening in London now, is the government&apos;s traffic forecasts. They have been over-estimating traffic since the late 1980s, and are predicting a 40% growth in traffic by 2040. The high forecasts completely prejudice economic assessment towards adding new road capacity rather than providing alternatives. The problems with the forecasts are many and varied, and we&apos;d like to see a complete overhaul of the methods and assumptions so that planning for sustainable transport has a better chance.  \u2013 Sian Berry  \u2022 Want your say?

Dutch (anon, 25) Twee Belgische boeven besluiten om in de nacht een overal te gaan plegen op een bank. Ze hebben de overval goed voorbereid en besproken zodat ze op de bewuste nacht zonder enige problemen de bank binnen kunnen komen. Die nacht gaan ze inbreken en zonder dat ook maar \u00e9\u00e9n van de alarmsystemen afgaat komen ze in de kamer met alle kluizen. De eerste Belg krijgt \u00e9\u00e9n van de kluizen open, maar schrikt zich rot wanneer hij erachter komt dat er alleen \u00e9\u00e9n potje yoghurt staat. De twee Belgische boeven beginnen alle kluizen open te breken en \u00e9\u00e9n voor \u00e9\u00e9n vinden ze elke keer weer een potje yoghurt. De ene Belg zegt: &quot;We zijn voor de gek gehouden! Laten we alle yoghurt opeten om hen terug te pakken&quot; en direct beginnen de twee Belgen alle yoghurt op te eten. Wanneer alle yoghurt op is vertrekken de twee Belgen met een volle buik. De volgende dag staat er op de voorpagina van de krant: &quot;Onbegrijpelijke inbraak in de spermabank.&quot; Two bandits decide to rob a bank at night. They have planned it carefully so that they will have no trouble entering. On the night of the robbery, not a single alarm goes off. When they enter the bank they come across a room filled with vaults. One of the bandits manages to open one of the vaults, only to discover there is nothing inside except a small bowl of yoghurt. The two bandits open up all the vaults, one by one, and each vault only contains a small bowl of yoghurt. &quot;We have been cheated! Let&apos;s eat all the yoghurt to get back at them!&quot; The two bandits eat all the yoghurt and leave with their bellies full.

Probably not. London, Bristol, New York and Copenhagen all have both. And while strong leadership might not be the only factor driving the green agenda, it is certainly an important one. In December last year, we published our low carbon cities report, which provides examples of how cities in the UK and around the world are going green while supporting economic growth. We found that by providing the vision, strategy and commitment for reducing carbon emissions, mayors such as Bristol&apos;s George Ferguson, New York&apos;s former mayor Michael Bloomberg and London&apos;s Boris Johnson are playing a vital role in advancing this agenda, often ahead of their respective national governments. For example: \u2022 Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s support was crucial in launching the ambitious PlaNYC: green, greater New York. The mayor formed the office of long term planning and sustainability, co-ordinated actions across the city council, and lobbied other parts of the US government to get new bills passed. Early assessments show that the plan is working. For example, the city is already saving $4m (\u00a32.4m) annually on energy costs after retrofitting hundreds of its buildings. \u2022 In Bristol, mayor Ferguson&apos;s leadership and support for the city&apos;s green agenda is often cited as one of the main factors behind its success. His vision and commitment helps bring people together, ensures strategic co-ordination between departments, organisations and other authorities and also helps to market the city (locally and internationally) as a sustainability leader. In recognition, Bristol is the first UK city to be awardedthe European green capital (2015) and Ferguson is using this award to attract interest from around the globe. \u2022 In London, Johnson&apos;s strong support for cycling is important to achieving a shift towards more sustainable transport in the city. In addition to promising a cycling revolution, underpinned by new cycle superhighways, safer streets and doubling the cycling budget to \u00a3400m by 2015, the mayor is deploying more traffic police on London&apos;s junctions during rush hours and lobbying the UK government to implement the European parliament&apos;s safety regulations. These examples and others from cities such as Copenhagen, Stockholm, Oslo and Amsterdam demonstrate the importance of having strong, committed leaders pushing this agenda. However, it&apos;s important to also note that while strong leadership is important, it is not the only thing that matters. The success of green strategies also relies heavily on the institutions and individuals that sit behind those leaders (such as Transport for London). It is these bodies and individuals that turn the leader&apos;s vision into reality by setting out strategies, negotiating with private and public agencies and guiding the day to day delivery of the agenda. Other important factors highlighted in our report include having good knowledge of the city&apos;s industries, businesses and citizens and forming the right networks and partnerships that enable new projects to go forward. For a city&apos;s green strategy to be successful it must reflect and influence local desires and values. In fact, one of the main reasons why cities decide to focus on green issues at all is that their citizens express a strong desire to live in a cleaner, more sustainable way, and they elect the leaders who will (or are committed to) make that happen. So while strong leadership might not be the only factor driving green initiatives, evidence from the UK and international cities shows that it tends to be an indispensable part of the mix. Strong city leaders can bring people together, determine the city&apos;s priorities and convey a clear, long term commitment to a low-carbon agenda. It is therefore no coincidence that green success and strong leadership go hand in hand, and will continue to do so always. Nada Nohrova is a researcher at the Centre for Cities \u2022 Want your say?

United were desperate to regain the trophy they won in 1999 but were unable to defend the following season, convinced by the Football Association to take part in the Club World Championship in Brazil in January 2000 instead, on the erroneous basis that their presence would boost England&apos;s chances of hosting the 2006 World Cup. Clever, clever. United were criticised but insisted that they were not given a choice, while David Davies, the FA&apos;s interim executive director, was looking to the future. &quot;We opposed it initially, but we&apos;ve had to look outwards,&quot; he said. &quot;Whether we like it or not there is going to be a World Club Cup in the future.&quot; But the FA&apos;s politicking did not quite go to plan. The World Cup went to Germany and they had successfully undermined their own competition. Still, that Club World Cup sure has been a hoot for the past 14 years \u2026 For Manchester United, then, the FA Cup was not to be taken lightly in the 2000-01 season. From their point of view, Chelsea were merely interim holders, winning it by default in their absence and order would be restored now that they were back. It was certainly difficult to look past them. Their campaign began with an awkward trip in the third round to Jean Tigana&apos;s Fulham, who were running away with the Division One title and gave United a fright, but eventually succumbed to an excellent winner in the 89th minute from Teddy Sheringham. The fourth-round draw was kind to them, handed a home tie against Harry Redknapp&apos;s West Ham, who were floating about harmlessly in mid-table in the Premier League. West Ham&apos;s record at Old Trafford, where they had not won since 1986, was miserable. They had lost on each of their subsequent 11 visits and were comprehensively beaten 3-1 when they faced United in the league on New Year&apos;s Day in 2001. No one, not even the 9,000 travelling West Ham fans, was expecting the Cup to work its magic four weeks later. While West Ham had been in acceptable form, they were beset by injuries to key players. After failing to replace Rio Ferdinand adequately after his \u00a318m move to Leeds United in November, West Ham then lost their captain, Steve Lomas, and right winger, Trevor Sinclair, to bad knee injuries in the middle of January. To make matters worse, Shaka Hislop, their goalkeeper, and Freddie Kanout\u00e9, their brilliant but fragile forward, were struggling with knee and calf injuries, respectively. United were missing Paul Scholes. His place alongside Roy Keane in midfield was taken by Nicky Butt. Hislop and Kanout\u00e9 both passed fitness tests on the morning of the match, but the early signs were not promising for the former. A fine shot-stopper, he had not been as commanding in goal since his return from a broken leg and his dodgy knee meant that Stuart Pearce had to take West Ham&apos;s goal-kicks. Given the circumstances, it would have been advisable for West Ham to avoid backpasses but where&apos;s the fun in making life easy for yourself. After 15 minutes, the ball was rolled back to Hislop and, as Ryan Giggs closed him down, his legs turned to jelly and a hapless slice sent the ball spinning towards the West Ham goal. Time stood still and Giggs set off in pursuit of the ball \u2013 but Hannu Tihinen, a new loan signing, beat him to it, booting clear two yards from the line. West Ham had a liability in goal. But it was not hard to understand why they wanted to keep Hislop on given that their substitute goalkeeper, Craig Forrest, had conceded 16 goals on his previous two appearances at Old Trafford. He was in goal when West Ham lost 7-1 to United in April 2000 and when Ipswich lost 9-0 in 1995. It was mostly one-way traffic in the first half, as Giggs twice went close, Andy Cole headed wide and Hislop tipped a David Beckham free-kick over. West Ham should have fallen behind after 55 minutes. Cole sped past Christian Dailly on the right and when his shot was blocked by Hislop, Sheringham blazed the rebound into the Stretford End from 12 yards out. Hislop smiled and a minute later, he denied Giggs after a lightning break from United. Somehow West Ham were surviving the United storm and in front of the England manager, Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, Michael Carrick, Joe Cole and Frank Lampard were starting to put on a show. Soon Cole was step-overing past Keane and shooting from 25 yards, Barthez diving to his right to push the ball away. After 76 minutes, West Ham attacked again, the move starting with Carrick, Cole and Lampard playing their way out of trouble with an intricate triangle in their own half. England&apos;s future, right there. The ball was worked to Sebastien Schemmel on the right and he touched it inside to Kanout\u00e9, under little pressure 40 yards from goal. He surveyed his options and then, as United&apos;s defence attempted to push up, he stroked a pass through to Paolo Di Canio. The arms went up, the flag stayed down and Di Canio was through on goal. Di Canio was through on goal! The Italian still had a lot to do. The pass forced him wide and Barthez could easily close down the angle by coming off his line. Instead, he just stood there with his arm in the air, as if he was hailing a taxi, attempting to fool Di Canio into thinking that the linesman had raised his flag. But you can&apos;t kid a kidder and Di Canio, ignoring Lampard to his left, poked the ball past the United keeper with the outside of his right foot to give West Ham the lead. There were still 14 minutes plus Fergie Time left, though, and United, now with four strikers on, poured forward. In the 90th minute Ole Gunnar Solskjaer arrowed a shot inches wide. Then he nodded down to Cole, whose thumping drive was brilliantly pushed away by Nigel Winterburn. Incredibly Paul Durkin did not award a penalty. Ferguson later blamed him and also said that holding big rugby matches at Old Trafford had damaged the pitch. The game ended with West Ham camped in their six-yard box and Barthez in their half, the crowd treated to the bizarre sight of the United goalkeeper playing as a left-winger. JS 2) West Ham 1-6 Manchester United, 6 May 1967     Manchester United beat West Ham to become the League champions in 1967, prompting a pitch invasion at the end of the match. Photo: Keystone/Getty Images    Human relationships are governed either by inescapable fact \u2013 family, as it&apos;s sometimes known \u2013 or serendipity. The friends and spouses we contract are generally determined by chance, a reality quite disquieting to contemplate. In sport, it&apos;s fact that dominates; serious, inalienable associations are based first on geography and then direct competition. But, occasionally, one is generated from beyond these parameters such as that between Manchester United and West Ham United, a product of circumstance and consequence. The clubs have always shared similar philosophies \u2013 attractive football, homegrown talent and wild support - and now, are managed by David Moyes and Sam Allardyce. But the rivalry is based on significantly more than that, beginning in earnest in 1964. At the start of March, the sides met at Upton Park, a game for which Matt Busby omitted George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton \u2013 United had an FA Cup quarter-final second replay two days later. They beat a full-strength Hammers anyway and then thrashed Sunderland before travelling to Hillsborough, where they met West Ham again. In conditions which in those days constituted a revitalising shower, but now would mean abandonment and Wicked Witch of the West-style meltdowns, West Ham won 3-1, then beat Preston at Wembley. United were pipped to the title by Liverpool. But a year later, they were champions. With Paddy Crerand, Charlton and Law peaking, Best, and John Connelly still around, this was the highest iteration of Matt Busby&apos;s third great side \u2013 one that then went to Benfica, won 5-1, and changed the world. Injuries meant they fell at the semi-final stage and again lost the title to Liverpool, so, by 1966-67, time was running out \u2013 the Munich survivors still needed a European Cup, which needed a league title first. And with two games to go, they were well-placed, from January onwards following the pre-Jimmy Hill pro forma precisely; win at home, draw away. As such, if they could avoid defeat at West Ham, they would be champions, bringing a deluge of Mancunians to that there London \u2013 the game&apos;s attendance of 38,424 was a post-war record for Upton Park. United&apos;s young supporters boasted a burgeoning notoriety, and as such, those who travelled were greeted with aggravation \u2013 yet another example of the good, honest old-fashioned East End spirit that sustained London through the blitz and accordant spate of lootings. There followed much Tube disruption and many bloody faces. Inside the ground, its gates locked at 1.30pm, various projectiles were disbursed by those with suitable angle and range. But inside the shed, where there was no segregation, conditions were so cramped that aspiring participants could only fling bottles against the roof, and hope that the shrapnel located a suitable target. The matchday programme, meanwhile, was busy kvelling in the aftermath of West Ham&apos;s recent trip to Houston Astrodome to play Real Madrid. There also featured a reprint of a piece from the Houston Chronicle, written by the splendidly-named Wells Twombly and describing &quot;a great moment in sports history, comparable to the world&apos;s first indoor destruction derby or non-sanguinary bull baiting. The game that the multitudes of the Earth worship above all others was finally coming to the bloody backward colonies.&quot; Accordingly, there was no space in which to introduce the day&apos;s visitors, but they were well-known and close to full strength. David Herd was missing after breaking his leg in the act of scoring six weeks earlier, and Bobby Noble, injured in a car crash coming home from Sunderland, would never play again. But both iconic trios were in place, though just a few weeks earlier, Busby was rumoured to have sought Geoff Hurst to replace Herd, while Law had dominated Bobby Moore in Scotland&apos;s 3-2 victory over England \u2013 after which the victors proclaimed themselves unofficial World Champions. With West Ham on a run of five straight defeats, various youngsters were given a go, including a triffic young winger named Harry Redknapp, while the 20 year-old goalkeeper Colin Mackleworth made just his third appearance. United, in an all-white strip gleaming in the sun, went ahead through Charlton on two minutes, and within seven, had another. &quot;I scored with a header!&quot; recalls Crerand, before, even more incredibly, Bill Foulkes made it three \u2013 between them, the two played for United 1,082 times, mustering just 24 goals. Title already secure, just past the half&apos;s halfway point Best added a fourth, The Guardian&apos;s Albert Barham rhapsodising United&apos;s &quot;delicate meshing of the gears in the game&apos;s lubricated flow&quot;, and chastising a West Ham defence &quot;by turn apprehensive and careless&quot;. &quot;Upton Park was bedlam,&quot; shrilled David Meek in the Manchester Evening News. &quot;All hell was breaking loose as United were being roared on by over 30,000 near hysterical supporters. The referee had ordered the ballboys to try and clear the goalmouth which was knee deep in toilet rolls and streamers. The St John ambulance men were streaming along the sides of the pitch, their stretchers laden with fans who had succumbed to hysteria&quot;. At the break, United&apos;s players reclined in the changing room, only to be informed that &quot;3-0&apos;s a bit dodgy. Keep it tight&quot;. &quot;We scored straight from kick off,&quot; Crerand explains, &quot;and Matt, god bless him, came out a minute later, saw West Ham kicking off and thought it was the start of the game. &apos;Boss, it&apos;s 4-0&apos;, we said, so he said &apos;Och, go out and attack them, then!&apos;&quot; John Charles (namesake of the Welsh legend) quickly pulled a goal back, but was later goaded by Law at a corner, returning a dig at the cost of a penalty. Law duly scored, then knocked in the sixth at the end of a move also involving Crerand and Best. At full-time, United&apos;s supporters invaded the pitch, some digging up lumps of it before Busby arrived to address them, while outside the ground, rival fans engaged in earnest debate. But there was only one arrest \u2013 a Mancunian teenager, whose father was forced down to London to fetch him home. The Joy of Six has learnt that for this offence, he was awarded the inescapable fact of a stern and focused smacked bottom. DH 3) West Ham 1-1 Manchester United, 14 May 1995 It&apos;s hard to believe now, but once upon a time, Manchester United viewed midfield not just as a location, but a position. And for nearly 25 years, theirs boasted the best midfield general around \u2013 but perhaps because he was seen as an interregnum between Robson and Keane, Paul Ince never quite received the appreciation he deserved. When Keane picked him in his greatest United XI ahead of Scholes, it was simply assumed that he was seeking to provoke, rather than imparting the wisdom of a man who knew absolutely, from first hand and second fiddle. Which is why West Ham were so upset when Ince left. Well, that, and the fact that he was a local boy who posed for a photo in a United top before a protracted transfer was concluded. \u00a0 And there already existed a fair degree of animosity between the clubs. The 1967 conversations were followed by a succession of disturbances in 1975, 1983, 1985 and 1986, when both clubs also visited Amsterdam. With English clubs banned from Europe, pre-season tours replaced them in supporters&apos; affections, and, inevitably, those of United and West Ham both ended up on the Koningin Beatrix, where the inevitable happened. &quot;Only skirmishes&quot;, reckoned one celebrant, and a young Mani appeared similarly unflustered \u2013 but others in attendance knew differently. So it was that when United visited in 1992, things were tense; West Ham were effectively relegated, while United were in pursuit of their first title since the 1967 shenanigans. But, after starting the season well, their results had descended into binary unfinery, the struggle for goals blamed variously on the Old Trafford pitch, the failure to sign Mick Harford, and fixture congestion. Still, though, United were in control, a point behind Leeds with this game in hand, after which only two remained. Events were open and even, before, just after the hour, Ludek Miklosko saved Mark Hughes&apos;s overhead kick. Then, from the ensuing corner, Keen and Bishop broke, before Slater&apos;s left-wing cross was cleared by Pallister to the edge of the box and directly onto the instep of the advancing Kenny Brown \u2013 whose dad, er, Ken \u2013 had played in the 1964 game. He either controlled an outrageous near-half-volley into the bottom corner, or was hit by a ball that scooted into the bottom corner, but either way, West Ham were ahead. And they stayed ahead, United&apos;s every shot on target fielded by the immaculate Miklosko, such that when, at full-time, the PA blasted out Losing My Religion, they knew they had lost something far more valuable. Their fate was assured the following weekend, but just as United&apos;s being relegated by Denis Law is a myth, as they were down regardless, so too is the notion that the league was ceded at Anfield \u2013 it was simply rubbed in. In interview, Ferguson described West Ham&apos;s effort as &quot;obscene&quot;, a precursor to his &quot;cheating their manager&quot; comment in the 1995-96 run in that so upset Kevin Keegan. Clearly he had learned by then that these things are effective only when said in advance. Meanwhile, outside the ground, Cockney glee was unbound \u2013 this was an eternal moment to West Ham. When the teams next met, West Ham had won promotion and United that elusive title, before, in February, Ince made his first return to Upton Park. His injury at the end of 1991-92 had been a major factor in United&apos;s demise, but if he&apos;d been an outstanding influence then, now he was the complete midfielder, roaring around the pitch in a furious bionic crouch. Enjoying his most prolific season, he&apos;d scored the previous week in a shellacking of Wimbledon, one of the finest team performances of the Fergie era, and United were clear at the top of the table. But, secure in 14th spot, West Ham were ready for a fight. And so were their supporters, the atmosphere around and inside the ground pitched, intense and vicious - far more so than when Beckham returned from the World Cup in August 1998. United soon took the lead, Hughes slipping home Keane&apos;s cross, but were hauled back in the second half. First, rough play at the far post allowed Lee Chapman to ram past Schmeichel, before Trevor Morley put West Ham ahead three minutes later. However, not long before time, Miklosko only parried Irwin&apos;s cross, Hughes&apos;s lunge created a kerfuffle, and a supersonic hitchkick delivered Ince to willpower in the equaliser. His celebratory dash to the fans foreshadowed that he made at Anfield in May 1999, following a similar late equaliser to sicken those who&apos;d once loved him. The following season, the teams met on the final day. Again, West Ham were comfortable, whilst United needed to win and hope that Blackburn failed to beat Liverpool, in order to achieve three consecutive titles for the first time in their history. Everyone with an interest has their favourite Fergie selection foible, of which there are many: David May at right-back at Gothenburg, 1994; rushing back an unfit Juan Sebatian V\u00e9ron for Madrid in 2003; rushing back an unfit Ruud van Nistelrooy for Palace in 2005; Giggs, Scholes and Neville against Chelsea in 2010. But, already shorn of Eric Cantona&apos;s distaste for xenophobia, his omission of perhaps United&apos;s finest ever big-game player from this game is amongst the finest. So it was that when Manchester City&apos;s Michael Hughes opened the scoring, Manchester City&apos;s Mark was sat at the side. But, after he came on at half-time, Brian McClair equalised, and with Liverpool clawing back a deficit to lead Blackburn, United required one more goal. And unlike in 1992, less tired and less afraid, they could dominate possession, pinning West Ham back. But with men serried across the box, things were not easy. Though the common conception is that Andy Cole spurned a multitude of dollies, the reality is somewhat different. It is true that he should have found a way to score at least once, but at each chance was confronted by an inspired Miklosko, diving directly in front of the ball such that transporting it past him was tricky. He could not, Blackburn were champions, and Upton Park contorted and convulsed in merriment. &quot;We&apos;ll be back with Cantona!&quot; offered the away end and they were right; they would be, he would score a crucial winner, and United would reclaim the double. But first, they had to finish losing it, achieved at Wembley the following Saturday. Outside the ground, Cockney glee was unbound; this was another eternal moment to West Ham. DH 4) West Ham 2-4 Manchester United, 18 December 1999     Boing! Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images    As Gareth Southgate stepped up to take his penalty, everyone knew what was going to happen next. The universe is a cruel place. Southgate had to score to keep his side in the shoot-out. Opening up his body, he struck his penalty firmly with the inside of his right foot and sent the ball towards the goal. The direction was fine. It was not a bad effort. But Southgate had made his intentions too obvious. The goalkeeper dived the right way. The ball wasn&apos;t far enough into the corner and the goalkeeper reached it. Southgate had missed. His team had lost. Upton Park erupted. West Ham were in the semi-final of the League Cup and Southgate&apos;s Aston Villa were out. Gotcha! You thought \u2026 yes, we know what you thought. Southgate&apos;s miss came at the end of a gripping cup tie between West Ham and Villa at Upton Park on 15 December 1999. West Ham were through to the last four, where they would face Leicester City. But life is rarely that simple when West Ham are involved. Two days after the win over Villa, it emerged they had selected a cup-tied player, Manny Omoyinmi, and could be thrown out of the competition. Omoyinmi had only played the last seven minutes of extra-time after coming off the bench and did not take a penalty, but none of that mattered: West Ham were in trouble. Villa pressed for West Ham&apos;s elimination, but eventually settled for a replay at Upton Park in January, which they won. West Ham&apos;s club secretary Graham Mackrell, Sheffield Wednesday&apos;s secretary at the time of the Hillsborough disaster, and the football secretary Alison O&apos;Dowd both resigned. Omoyinmi did not appear for West Ham again. West Ham&apos;s manager, Harry Redknapp, bemoaned a &quot;cock-up&quot;. God forbid, of course, that he should know what one of his players was up to while he was on loan at Gillingham. Good old Harry. Such a character. A day after the story broke, a thoroughly fed-up West Ham hosted United. Everyone inside Upton Park was in a funk. The mood was flat and United wasted no time twisting the knife, an unmarked Dwight Yorke heading in David Beckham&apos;s cross after 10 minutes. Three minutes later Yorke turned provider, crossing for Giggs to flick past Hislop. Then Giggs battered a volley from 25 yards into the bottom-left corner. There were only 19 minutes gone. West Ham were all over the place. Yet they managed to drag themselves back into the match, Di Canio sending a scissor-kick under Raymond van der Gouw to give the home side a lifeline after 25 minutes. But surely that was just a minor inconvenience for United. Think again. Seven minutes into the second half, Marc Keller slipped a pass through to Di Canio, who drew Van der Gouw, jinked to the left and then tapped the ball into the empty net, to the considerable delight of the BBC&apos;s Barry Davies. United might have feared the worst. They are not immune to relinquishing healthy leads at Upton Park. In December 1996, they were 2-0 up with 12 minutes left but drew 2-2, Julian Dicks almost taking Peter Schmeichel&apos;s head off with the equalising penalty in a match that featured an exquisite Beckham chip. Beckham made a habit of scoring stunners at Upton Park. There was a cracking free-kick in a 2-2 draw (West Ham were 2-0 down with four minutes left, fought back through goals from Di Canio and Davor Suker and then saw Beckham hit the post twice in stoppage time) and a feathery chip in a 5-3 win for United in March 2002. But back to 1999. United were rocking and West Ham, inspired by Di Canio, in the form of his life, were rampant. Shortly after his second goal, he went through again, his hat-trick and West Ham&apos;s equaliser seemingly an inevitability. He dropped a shoulder, trying to trick Van der Gouw a second time. But this time the Dutchman would not be fooled so easily and stood his ground. This wasn&apos;t in the script and Di Canio was stuttering like Frank Underwood in a CNN debate. He tried a chip but the ball barely left the ground and Van der Gouw saved. United exacted swift and brutal punishment, Giggs bursting past Lomas on the left and crossing to Yorke, who poked in his second. Four-two to United, game over. But it was some game. JS 5) Manchester United 0-1 West Ham, 13 May 2007     Carlos Tevez scored to keep West Ham up in 2007. Three months later, he and Wayne Rooney were team-mates. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images    It was the final day of the 2006-07 season and West Ham went to Old Trafford needing to avoid defeat in order to stay up. But most of the country wanted to see them go down as punishment for the way they had contrived to sign Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano on the final day of the summer transfer window. Their fellow strugglers \u2013 Sheffield United, Charlton Athletic, Wigan Athletic and Watford \u2013 wanted West Ham to be handed a points deduction that would almost certainly have confirmed their relegation. Yet on 27 April, West Ham were fined a record \u00a35.5m fine instead after they were found guilty of acting improperly and withholding vital documentation over the ownership of Tevez and Mascherano, who were part-owned by Kia Joorabchian&apos;s Media Sports Investment when they left Corinthians. The Gang of Four reacted with disbelief. Among the reasons for the three-man panel&apos;s decision not to deduct points was the club&apos;s guilty plea and the fact that they were under new ownership. Terry Brown was the owner when Tevez and Mascherano were signed but sold the club to Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson in November 2007. Gudmundsson was an Icelandic billionaire and later declared bankrupt in 2009. In the panel&apos;s defence, they might also have suspected that West Ham were going down anyway, with or without a points deduction. For much of the season, they were a rabble. Rather than relishing the opportunity, key players were put out by the arrival of the two Argentinian superstars, team spirit deteriorated and Alan Pardew was replaced by Alan Curbishley after an appalling 4-0 defeat at Bolton in December. Curbishley&apos;s first game was against United and West Ham won 1-0 but their form soon nosedived again. On New Year&apos;s Day, they lost 6-0 at Reading, before losing 4-0 at Charlton in February. Mascherano was also allowed to join Liverpool in January. Four months later, he was excelling in a Champions League final. West Ham preferred to pick Hayden Mullins and Nigel Quashie. However Tevez was still around and although he did not score his first goal until March he was inspired during the run-in. A day after West Ham received their fine, they won 3-0 at Wigan and in their penultimate match, Tevez scored twice as Bolton were beaten 3-1 at Upton Park. Naturally all the focus was on him, although that ignored the vital contributions made by Robert Green, Lucas Neill, Mark Noble and Bobby Zamora. Green more or less defeated Arsenal single-handedly at the start of April, while Zamora scored the only goal in a win against Everton on 21 April. Yet when West Ham lost 3-0 to Sheffield United on 14 April \u2013 with Tevez in the side \u2013 their goose looked cooked. Sheffield United were five points clear with five games to play. Maybe Sheffield United relaxed. After all, there was nothing to suggest that West Ham could win their last four matches, especially as one of them was at Old Trafford. Yet United had already won the league, had the FA Cup final against Chelsea a week later and rested key players. While Wayne Rooney started, Giggs, Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo were on the bench. Even then, United still had enough to pin West Ham back for most of the first half. &quot;Curbishley&apos;s players had been penned in their own half, indebted to goalline clearances and United&apos;s careless finishing and desperately grateful for any respite from the home side&apos;s relentless attacking,&quot; Daniel Taylor wrote in the Guardian. And then, on the stroke of half-time, Tevez struck, bustling past Wes Brown and sidefooting underneath Edwin van der Sar. Over at Bramall Lane, Sheffield United were hosting Wigan, who had not won since the start of March. In order for both sides to stay up, they needed West Ham to lose. Otherwise a draw for Sheffield United would be enough, while Wigan needed to win. In a whirlwind first half, Paul Scharner gave the visitors an early lead, before Jon Stead equalised. Then, just as Tevez was giving West Ham the lead, Wigan won a penalty. Up stepped David Unsworth, who had moved to Wigan from Sheffield United in January, and he scored. At Old Trafford, the home fans were baying for West Ham&apos;s blood. They wanted them down and Ferguson reacted by bringing on Ronaldo, Scholes and Giggs just before the hour. Green had to make two great saves from Ronaldo. But West Ham were hanging on and Sheffield United needed to score. Danny Webber had their best chance but missed and they could not find a way through even after Wigan&apos;s Lee McCulloch was sent off. When the final whistles blew, West Ham and Wigan had survived. Sheffield United were down and so began their descent into League One, their anger hardly lessened by West Ham having to pay them millions in compensation. Seven years on, there are still people who have not forgiven West Ham. But perhaps their critics should consider this: while they stayed up in the most indefensible way imaginable, they did spectacularly annoy Neil Warnock and Sean Bean. That has to count for something. JS 6) West Ham 2-1 Manchester United, 2 February 1987     Frank McAvennie of West Ham is watched by Manchester United's Kevin Moran (left) at Upton Park in 1986. Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty    Like the vast majority of Britain, United and West Ham occupied most of the eighties with miserable dossing. But both enjoyed brief shining moments, some at the expense of the other. In 1983, United began their successful FA Cup campaign with a 2-0 home win over West Ham, and then, in 1985, came a quarter-final belter. On a typical Old Trafford bobbling bog that might have suited Trevor Brooking, Norman Whiteside&apos;s hat-trick helped United to a 4-2 win, which followed by beating Liverpool in a replayed semi-final masterpiece, before upsetting an Everton side that had just added the Cup Winners&apos; Cup to the championship, and was still reeling from three days celebrating with Howard Kendall. But West Ham had impressed with their smart, precise play, and revenge would come the following season. They weren&apos;t quite ready when the teams first met, United three games into a ten-match winning run \u2013 the second best opening streak in top division history. But at Sheffield Wednesday in November came their first defeat, a game in which Bryan Robson also got injured, and though they were still clear at Christmas, their lead was down from ten points to four. Then, a deal was agreed in the new year to sell Mark Hughes to Barcelona, his form suffered, and the mid-season addition of the ineptitude twins, Colin and Littleterry Gibson, served only to compound matters \u2013 momentum was gone. Robson returned for a cup tie at Sunderland, getting himself sent-off, but United won the replay, losing Strachan to injury instead. The next weekend, the first in February, they visited the Boleyn, two points off the top but with two games in hand on the leaders. West Ham, meanwhile, had long since deduced the relationship of what to what. Since the teams&apos; last meeting, they&apos;d lost only twice, and compiled a run of 12 wins in 14 games between the middles of September and December. In the summer, Frank McAvennie had arrived from St Mirren, and when an injury to Paul Goddard forced John Lyall to move him up front, he formed a partnership with Tony Cottee that became the most deadly in the division - and earned him an appearance on Wogan. But equally important was the return of Alan Devonshire, whose intellect supplied a sizeable chunk of the goals that took them to fifth in the table \u2013 eight points off the lead, but with three games in hand. The game was a Big Match Sunday afternoon bonus, and the teams were dressed for the occasion in jerseys to acquaint frisson with strides. The home side wore suggestive claret punctuated with pinstriped blue hoops, United the purest, most improper white, adorned with lascivious black shoulder braces and delectable red numbers. And they played as they looked, the game a classic of the era. After 26 minutes of exchanges, United took the lead, Hughes lifting a through-ball over Steve Walford, directly into the path of Robson \u2013 tanking towards the box for no reason other than it being the perfect thing to be doing. He then lobbed an expert&apos;s finish over Phil Parkes, one of several varieties of goal that were typical of him. But, halfway through the second half, with United comfortable, Devonshire \u2013 disguised as Frank Zappa \u2013 teed up Mark Ward. Just outside the right corner of the box, ball tottering along the turf, he spanked it first time and low across Bailey into the corner, for an excellent goal. United looked set to retaliate immediately \u2013 and then Robson departed with jiggered ankle. Shortly afterwards, Whiteside sliced into Cottee&apos;s path, Bailey charged out for no reason, and the ball was slotted by him, United&apos;s entire decade distilled into seven minutes. A month later, the teams reconvened for a midweek Cup date, producing yet another superb game. Robson was back \u2013 for three minutes and until he dislocated his shoulder, the image of Jim McGregor leading him off a standard of the time. McAvennie opened the scoring, but Frank Stapleton&apos;s brilliant header earned a replay \u2013 just as well, given the standard of the reverse kits. Back that weekend at a typically rutted Old Trafford, United dominated. But an excellent display from Parkes was furnished with an edge-of-the-box header from Geoff Pike \u2013 given his name, who else could he play for? \u2013 and a Ray Stewart penalty. The holders were out. In typical West Ham style, West Ham lost the quarter-final, played three days later, and their next two league games as well. But a run of 11 wins in 13 games kept them in the title race until its final day, and in the event they came third, their highest ever finish \u2013 before, in typical West Ham style, they slipped to 15th the following season. In typical United style, United sputtered to fourth place, then won only two of their first 13 on the resumption, eventually sacking Ron Atkinson. Alex Ferguson was appointed in his stead, and typical United style soon became something else: disappointment without attacking football or the tantalising prospect of glory and success. And then it became something very different altogether.

It did so in the certainty that she would never play live again. Half the piece was devoted to former collaborators hypothesising as to why: Bush had found the experience of touring too exhausting; she had been shattered by the accidental death of her lighting director, Bill Duffield, after a performance in Poole; the tour had proved too expensive to stage; she had only ever intended it to be a one-off event, and \u2013 having proved she could mount a groundbreaking visually extravagant tour in the face of condescending suggestions that she &quot;couldn&apos;t gig&quot; \u2013 had chosen to move on. In fact, a year after the article appeared, she made vague suggestions in an interview that she might perform live again \u2013 &quot;maybe not a tour, but something&quot; \u2013 but no one really held their breath in anticipation. Kate Bush had said stuff like that in interviews before, but the only live performances she had given in decades were five fleeting guest appearances, one of which involved duetting with Rowan Atkinson on a song called Do Bears Shit In the Woods? at a charity show.     Kate Bush in Amsterdam in 1979. Photograph: Rob Verhorst/Redferns    After Bush broke a 12-year silence with the release of 2005&apos;s Aerial, it was painfully apparent that she was only interested in conducting a musical career entirely on her own terms: given that she has only made one public appearance since Aerial&apos;s release \u2013 collecting an award for her 2011 album 50 Words For Snow \u2013 it seemed safe to assume those terms did not include returning to the stage. On Friday, however, Bush confounded all reasonable expectations by suddenly announcing a 15-night residency at the Hammersmith Apollo \u2013 the same venue at which she performed the final shows of her 1979 tour \u2013 beginning on 26 August. Although tickets do not go on sale until next Friday, her website almost immediately broke down under the weight of traffic following the announcement. Even in a world where David Bowie&apos;s 2013 return to recording has supposedly immunised the public to rock legends springing surprises on their audience, the level of shock the announcement has caused seems entirely understandable. The decade that Bowie spent in &quot;retirement&quot; feels like the blink of an eye compared with the 35 years since Kate Bush played a full live show. Indeed, it&apos;s hard to think of another artist who has left it so long between gigs. The last time Kate Bush announced she was playing live, James Callaghan was prime minister, beer was 34p a pint, Mind Your Language was still on TV and no one outside of the south Bronx had heard of rapping. And the public perception of Kate Bush was markedly different. She was a star \u2013 indeed she was such a big star that tBBC News covered the preparations for her tour \u2013 but there was the sense that she wasn&apos;t taken terribly seriously. In the popular imagination she was a dippy woman who waved her arms a lot, sang in a shrieky voice and said wow every other word. The fact that she was possessed of a talent so preternatural as to appear slightly eerie \u2013 if your 13-year-old daughter wrote a song like The Man with the Child in His Eyes, it&apos;s tempting to wonder whether your first call would be to a record label talent scout, or a psychiatrist \u2013 was somehow outweighed by the fact that she was a gift to impressionists.     Performing in Hammersmith in 1979. Photograph: Peter Still/Redferns    Thirty-five years on, she returns to the stage of the former Hammermsith Odeon such a towering, totemic presence in British rock that it&apos;s virtually impossible for a young female artist to try anything even vaguely out of the ordinary without being compared to her. The prospect of her performing live is intriguing, partly because of the question of what&apos;s prompted her decision, but mostly because of the question of what form the shows might take: the announcement gave nothing away unless you count the accompanying photo of Bush bobbing about in water, wearing a lifejacket, which some observers have taken as a reference to The Ninth Wave, the suite of songs about a drowning woman that took up side two of her 1985 masterpiece Hounds of Love. The 1979 tour was a tightly choreographed, physically-demanding extravaganza that left the 20-year-old Bush &quot;wiped out&quot;: it&apos;s hard to imagine her attempting anything equivalent at 55. That said, Bush has been obsessed with presenting her music in a suitably lavish way since the start of her career, so it&apos;s equally hard to imagine that the shows are going to involve a stripped-down, unplugged performance at the piano. You can speculate wildly, but the truth is that no one really has any idea what Kate Bush is going to do, which seems perfectly fitting: that&apos;s been pretty much the case throughout her career.", "sentences": ["Kate Bush in Amsterdam in 1979."], "title": "Kate Bush announces live shows, so let's party like it's 1979", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/21/kate-bush-announces-live-shows-party-1979", "tags": ["Kate Bush", "Pop and rock", "Music", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-21T18:31:45Z", "article": "1.

This Wired piece collects a gallery of Keitel&apos;s photos of Dhaka&apos;s slums taken over two and a half months and interviews the photographer, who &quot;isn&apos;t romanticising poverty, or making poverty porn&quot;. Instead, his tactic was to &quot;draw viewers in with visually stimulating photos, and offer them a chance to ask questions about what they\u2019re seeing&quot;, writes Doug Bierend. &quot;People\u2019s whole lives are compressed here to about 3\u00d73 meters \u2014 I just wanted to show this, because there is a beauty in it as well,&quot; said Keitel.  2. A frozen New York, from above It has snowed in New York this winter. A lot. Frankly, we&apos;re a bit sick of hearing about it. But repetition brings opportunity, and photographer George Steinmetz, he of Hurricane Sandy fame and one of the world&apos;s pre-eminent aerial photographers, took to the sky to photograph the snowbound city \u2013 subway yards, cemeteries, and athletic fields below \u2013 from the seat of a two-person, piston-powered helicopter for this impressive New Yorker gallery.  3. Ten lessons in citizen engagement Modern cities face many increasingly complicated issues: demands for affordable housing and public transit, tensions around gentrification and density or connecting the dots between city planning and climate change. But at the same time, local governments face the challenge of involving as many and as diverse as possible local community voices to help come up with solutions. With this in mind, two Vancouver urbanists, Brent Toderian and Jillian Glover, have studied what cities in their region are doing well, according to them, to boost civic participation. Among the good practices are: bringing city hall to the community (physically and online), allowing access to city services through smartphones, embracing storytelling in communications as a way to attract citizen interest or mapping community assets.  4. Love letter to Sao Paulo &quot;&apos;N\u00e3o existe amor em SP&apos;, sings Criolo in that beautiful song of his. I must admit, I was inclined to agree with him when my Paulistano wife and I first moved to S\u00e3o Paulo from London just over two years ago. During my first few months here the city felt like an impenetrable and ugly concrete jungle whose dense canopy consisted solely of bland high-rises. And, of course, there was the bumper-to-bumper traffic, smelly rivers and turnstiles on buses, which even now still baffle me.&quot; So begins Andrew Martin&apos;s blog post about his gradual love for his adoptive city of Sao Paulo, published originally on the Huffington Post. An eloquent account of a progressive change \u2013 from disdain to defensiveness, followed by fondness \u2013 that many have experienced as an integral part of moving to a new city.  5. New Springfield transit map It looks like the fictional Springfield&apos;s transit system has had a complete overhaul \u2013 if the map that appeared on this week&apos;s episode of Season 25 of The Simpsons is anything to go by... As you can see in this Transit Maps blog post, there&apos;s quite a big difference from its previous (nonsensical, of course) look.      Simpsons transit map Photograph: Simpsons Wiki    6. Best wishes  Best Wishes Magazine is an online publication that describes itself as a collection of creative city chapters. Its creator, Jessica Jungbauer, explains that living in Berlin, she wondered what people loved about the German capital and how city life inspired their work. The result is a sleek selection of nibbles about lifestyle, cafes and interesting shops \u2013 but it also offers insights about the experience of moving between cities and being a newcomer. For instance, they interviewed Paul Sullivan, writer, photographer and founder of Slow Travel Berlin, who reflected: &quot;Aside from the obvious, well-documented things \u2013 abundant space, a spirit of tolerance, a relatively low population, an excellent cycling network and public transport links, easy access to a countryside dominated by forests and lakes, a largely independent/DIY infrastructure \u2013 there are more complex and nuanced attractions. The hidden stories and eccentric characters, the dark, twisted history and the unexpected delights of the city\u2019s interzones and edgelands.&quot; They also have chapters dedicated to Oslo, Amsterdam and, from this week, London.

In his balanced review, Trishit calls the book  &quot;An unforgettable classic which is recommended for all the ages&quot;,  But he also notices omissions in the journey.  &quot;it is very clear that Phileas Fogg didn&apos;t travel to the continents of South America and Africa. Jules Verne missed out on those two continents and so the title of the book \u2013 Around the World in Eighty Days \u2013 is somewhat ironic.&quot;      Anne Plichota, Cendrine Wolf, Oksa Pollock: The Last Hope     Phileas Fogg&apos;s story ends with a return to London. Oksa Pollock&apos;s exploits start when she moves from Paris to London with her parents, her grandmother and her best friend Gus. She starts to discover family secrets and her own magical abilities. SophieDophie, who lives in France, wrote this first ever review of the series by Anne Plichota and Cendrine Wolf on the Guardian children&apos;s books website in 2011. Oksa Pollock&apos;s adventures hadn&apos;t even been translated into English yet!   &quot;She and her family are not from Earth \u2013 they actually come from a parallel world called Edefia. They&apos;re trying to get back to Edefia, but the only person who has the magical powers to achieve this is Oksa. Hopefully you won&apos;t have to wait too long to become &apos;Pollockmaniacs&apos;&quot;!  It has been translated now \u2013 phew \u2013 by Sue Rose, and SophieDophie was right about Pollockmania! HorseLover3000 loved the first novel in the series, The Last Hope.  &quot;Oksa thinks she is just a normal girl, moving to England from France. But when she starts to discover unknown powers, she has no idea how her life will change.  I think this book is fantastic. The characters are well thought out, very believable and realistic, and it is a new take on the whole magical world idea. I think the villain in it is an especially good character because he is Oksa&apos;s teacher, which makes it realistic and makes you wonder if your teachers could be anything like that.&quot;      Anne Plichota, Wolf Cendrine, Oksa Pollock: The Forest of Lost Souls     If you enjoyed Oksa Pollock&apos;s first exploit then you can look forward to five more! SophieDophie highly recommends the sequel.  &quot;If you haven&apos;t heard of Oksa Pollock, now is the time to find out about her because The Forest of Lost Souls is the second book of her amazing adventures. It&apos;s really easy to imagine the action in your head because of the way it&apos;s been written \u2013 you feel as if you&apos;re there with Oksa and Gus in the deep, dark forest, and although the story&apos;s quite complex, you never get confused. In fact, the complicated plot and made-up words make the book even more interesting to read.&quot;      Astrid Lindgren, Pippi Longstocking    From Oksa to another adventurous heroine, Astrid Lindgern&apos;s Pippi Longstocking (translated from Swedish by Edna Hurup). Lady Abigail tells us about the Swedish character&apos;s quirky charm.  &quot;Pippi Longstocking is a 9-year-old girl who does not have a Mother or Father. Pippi says that her Father got lost in a storm and landed on a desert island and that he became king of all of the creatures there. At one point, Pippi Longstocking walks backwards because she does not want to turn around on the way back home. I think that is a bit odd but at least she does not bang her face. If she bumps into some things she will just bang the back of her head.&quot;      Erich K\u00e4stner, Emil And The Detectives (Red Fox Classics)     Kung Fu Kitty has written a brilliant review of another classic translation: Emil and Detectives by German author Erich K\u00e4stner (translated by Eileen Hall).   &quot;Emil and the Detectives is an exciting younger children&apos;s book full of adventure. From the minute Emil steps on the train on his own, clutching a bunch of flowers and seven pounds tucked away in his jacket for his Grandma, you know something exciting will happen. But when a man in a bowler hat gets on and sits opposite him, you become certain. When Emil falls asleep and wakes up the money is gone, and you join him on a search all over Berlin for the money. Luckily it&apos;s a busy city and there are plenty of boys about, ready to help Emil catch the man in the bowler hat. But what about Gran at the station? How long will she wait? And will Emil be able to give her the money his mother has entrusted him with?&quot;      Georges Remi Herg\u00e9, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of The Unicorn    Another character with tangled mysteries to solve is Tintin, brought to life in 23 graphic stories by the Belgian cartoonist Herg\u00e9 (translated by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner). Butterfly Rainbow and Purple Unicorns were taken on two of Tintin&apos;s sea voyages, in The Secret of the Unicorn:  &quot;Tintin buys this model boat, and he discovers something amazing whilst getting into lots of trouble. The boat leads him on a search for treasure. If you read it you&apos;ll love it. Every time I&apos;m typing about this, I&apos;m reading! I can&apos;t get enough of it.&quot; And The Shooting Star:      Georges Remi Herg\u00e9, The Shooting Star (The Adventures of Tintin)     &quot;I like this book because it is often very funny and smart. There is a lot of action almost on every page and suspense and twists and turns in the plot right till the end. The pictures by Herg\u00e9 are very colourful and whenever you look at them, you can almost see the whole story in front of your eyes, like a film!&quot; ilynx21 has let us know about another graphic novel, A Game of Swallows by Lebanese writer and illustrator Zeina Abirached (and translated by Edward Gauvin) in his thoughtful review.  &quot;A Game for Swallows is a historical fiction graphic novel about Lebanon&apos;s civil war. What makes this book stand out from other graphic novels is the feeling that Zeina puts into the book, which makes you really feel the characters&apos; emotions. The narrator tells the story from the point of view of someone who very well could have existed and lived at that time in that place. In the book, it tells the story of two children who are waiting for their parents with the neighbours in a time of bombing. In conclusion, it is really worth reading because it makes you feel like you are in a war and that is a very unique experience.&quot;      Anne Frank, The     Another story that will teach older readers about tragic historical circumstances is Anne Frank&apos;s Diary of a Young Girl (translated by Susan Massotty). It is translated non-fiction: a real diary kept by a young German Jew during the second world war. In his sensitive review SkulduggeryPleasant notices the contrast between some &quot;light-hearted&quot; details of Anne&apos;s everyday life and the extraordinarily difficult situation for Jews in Germany at the time.  &quot;In the 1940s, Germany invaded Holland and the Nazis started creating a load of anti-Jew rules. Otto Frank knew he had to do something to protect his family. They went into hiding. In the building of Anne Frank&apos;s Dad&apos;s office, behind a bookcase, is a marvellous secret annexe, two floors and an attic full of strangeness. Find out about life in the annexe of 263 Prinsengracht, Amsterdam, from the perspective of a teenage girl and the strange arguments and discussions that take place in the Jews&apos; struggle to survive and Anne&apos;s struggle to stay a part of her family. This book at first seems rather light-hearted with the oddness of living without daylight but soon Anne&apos;s diary gets flooded with hardship as she gets bullied by almost everyone. A great book about the will to survive.&quot;      Jo Nesbo, Doctor Proctor's Fart Powder    Those looking for a jolly reading experience might turn to Jo Nesbo&apos;s Doctor Proctor&apos;s Fart Powder, translated from Norwegian by Tara F Chace.  The first book in the series had reviewer Waddleme in hysterics!  &quot;A hilariously funny, totally crazy, and exceptionally brilliant book. Five laughs a page, brilliantly set, with some fantastic characters.&quot;   And don&apos;t worry because Yoshi assures us there are more laughs to come in Doctor Proctor&apos;s second adventure, Time-Travel Bath Bomb.  &quot;I thought this book was an excellent sequel and it was every bit as crazy as the first Doctor Proctor adventure.&quot;      Tove Jansson, Finn Family Moomintroll (Moomins)     Another Nordic children&apos;s book is Finn Family Moomintrollby Tove Jansson. The translation (by Elizabeth Portch) captured the imagination of reviewer anteater.  &quot;The way Tove Jansson, the Finnish author, writes about Moominvalley just makes you want to live there! The Moomins are little creatures who live in a beautiful valley and are always having adventures together.  Tove Jansson created the most spectacular adventures for the Moomins and friends, and I think anyone over six would very much enjoy the series.&quot;      Cornelia Funke, Reckless     German author Cornelia Funke also manages to create fantastic new worlds in her readers minds. AYRA loved Reckless, the first book in the MirrorWorld series, translated by Oliver Latsch.  &quot;This is one of the best books I have ever read because the author wrote the book in a way that allowed you to feel that you were part of the story, and created the characters in such a way that I felt I had known them all my life.&quot;      Cornelia Funke, Dragon Rider    Tigerwatcher is just as enthusiastic about Funke&apos;s novel Dragon Rider (translated by Anthea Bell).  &quot;Dragon Rider is a magical story that will leave you wanting more. When Firedrake (a dragon) and Sorrel (a brownie) set off on a journey to the Rim of Heaven, they find themselves in the middle of an ancient legend. As they head towards the Himalayas with a boy and a manikin in tow hidden secrets are released. However, someone is not to be trusted...  An absolutely amazing story. Unputdownable. This is the best book I have ever read as the descriptions really give you a sense of being in the action. I think any person from the age of 9 upwards would love this book. I give it 110 out of 5 stars!!!!!!!!&quot;      Carlos Ruiz Zafon, Marina    We&apos;ll finish off this round-up with Marina, a mystery novel for older readers by Spanish author Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n (and translated by Lucia Graves) in this beautiful review by alannahbee.  &quot;With flowing prose and a story-line that would entice any historical fiction enthusiast, Marina is a fine piece of well-crafted, intriguing, chilling literature. The story is narrated by fifteen-year-old Oscar Drai, a boarding school student who appears to be unravelling in his very own exponential crisis. He stumbles across a semi-dilapidated house in the outskirts of Barcelona which, as he soon comes to find, belongs to Germ\u00e1n Blau, an enigmatic, aged artist and his daughter, Marina. Oscar falls for Marina and her delicate yet feisty condition and, one Sunday morning, they walk down to the old Barcelona quarter to witness a macabre and mysterious ceremony at a hidden cemetery: a woman, veiled in black, places a single rose upon a grave embossed with a small black butterfly. They follow this woman through the winding back-streets of the Catalonian city (Zaf\u00f3n&apos;s descriptive language of the architectural structures is a feat in itself), thus unravelling thirty years of mystery and tragedy at the hands of crippling greed and man&apos;s thirst for longevity. Marina is one of those books that are meant to be devoured in one sitting; feasted upon quickly, as it will truly curb any hunger you might have had for a good read.&quot;  Phew! We&apos;ve travelled to far-flung places and had access to words written in many foreign languages. Of course, like Phileas Fogg, we&apos;ve had to miss out a few... but let these reviews inspire your own journey in translated fiction.

But US President Barack Obama&apos;s visit on Tuesday will strain the city like never before with \u20ac10m ($10.4m, \u00a38.4m) of Belgian money being spent to cover his 24 hours in the country. The president will arrive on Tuesday night with a 900-strong entourage, including 45 vehicles and three cargo planes. Advance security teams orchestrating every last detail have combed Brussels already, checking the sewers and the major hospitals, while American military helicopters were last week given the green light for overflights. The city hosts at least four EU summits a year, with each of these gatherings costing \u20ac500,000 in extra police, military and transport expenses. &quot;But this time round, you can multiply that figure by 20,&quot; said Brussels mayor, Yvan Mayeur. The city&apos;s four-stage security scale will be raised from two to three during the visit, Obama&apos;s first to the country. A tight cordon will surround The Hotel, the 27-storey former Hilton in the Toison d&apos;Or shopping district where the president will spend the night. Belgium itself is mobilising 350 police and military on motorbikes to secure the president&apos;s routes to EU and Nato summits on Wednesday, while a convoy of nine US helicopters will take Obama to an American first world war cemetery. After landing at Wevelgem aerodrome, a phalanx of 30 armoured cars will take Obama to the cemetery where \u2013 accompanied by Belgium&apos;s King Philippe and Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo \u2013 he will tour the battlefield and lay a wreath. Obama will return to Brussels for a lunchtime summit with the European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, and the European Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso. He will then go to Nato&apos;s headquaters for a meeting with its secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Obama, who spent Monday in Amsterdam and The Hague, will depart Brussels on Wednesday evening for Rome, where he will meet Pope Francis. His sole planned speech during his three-nation, four-day European tour will be to a 2,000-strong audience at Brussels&apos; Centre for Fine Arts (Bozar) on Wednesday afternoon. Brussels already has a reputation as a gridlock capital, ahead of the likes of Los Angeles and London. But Brigitte Grouwels, who heads the city&apos;s transport policy, said the expected lockdown of key areas during Obama&apos;s visit should encourage locals to walk, cycle and take public transport. She said: &quot;Obama&apos;s visit gives an excellent opportunity \u2026 to experience first hand a city unencumbered by cars.&quot; Officials say Obama is unlikely to indulge in an impromptu city walkabout like George W Bush who, during a 2005 visit, dropped in on the distinguished chocolatier Mary to buy a box of pralines.", "sentences": ["Obama, who spent Monday in Amsterdam and The Hague, will depart Brussels on Wednesday evening for Rome, where he will meet Pope Francis."], "title": "Barack Obama's first visit to Brussels to cost Belgium more than \u20ac10m", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/barack-obama-visit-brussels-cost-belgium-10m", "tags": ["Barack Obama", "European Union", "Nato", "World news", "George Bush", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-24T21:45:38Z", "article": "The Hague all but closed down for the arrival of 53 world leaders in the small picturesque city. It shut a runway at the nearest airport, Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, so there would be enough room for the visitors to park their jets for the two-day meeting. A large area of the city was cordoned off and so many roads were closed that the centre was almost deserted. The city has seen the staging of the third Nuclear Security Summit as an opportunity to bolster its identity as a global centre for peace and justice, rivalling Geneva. The meeting is being held on the site of the war crimes tribunal and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, now playing a key role in Syria. Dutch hosts of previous summits have sought to play up the quirky, unconventional nature of their country. At the 1997 EU summit, they tried to persuade European leaders to go from the meeting hall to lunch on bicycles, with unhappy results that still make Dutch officials wince. The German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, refused to go anywhere near a bike, shouting: &quot;I am not a monkey!&quot; The Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari, who was almost as bulky, had to be supported in the saddle by aides. The newly elected Tony Blair turned the jaunt into a serious race, so he could demonstrate Britain was once more &quot;leading in Europe&quot;. His aides picked the best bike and made sure it was in good working order, allowing their man to sail pass Europe&apos;s older leaders and dismount while they were still puffing away. This time, the Dutch dropped the idea of bicycles. Instead, they turned down the lights in the chamber and treated the summit to a multimedia presentation. It started with a film in which a glowing, radioactive-looking baton landed at the feet of a surprised citizen who picked it up only to find himself dragged along by its mysterious powers. As he passed by, others followed dancing through the streets, going by illustrations of everything the Netherlands is good at: Old Master paintings, football and Johan Cruyff, and speed skaters. Then the dancers, a violinist and a singer materialised inside the hall within the circular negotiating table, and the lights went quickly on, revealing a smile on Barack Obama&apos;s face that was half amused, half bemused. The summit was focused on how to lock up the world&apos;s nuclear materials more securely so they would not be so easy for terrorists to steal, but inevitably this long-term goal was partly overshadowed by short-term concerns over Ukraine. In the margins, the country&apos;s foreign minister, Andrii Deshchytsia, told journalists that he looked forward to meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, for the first time to talk peace and maybe even have a vodka together. Within half an hour, half his wish was granted. A picture was issued by the Russian foreign minister showing the two men staring grimly across a bare white table, with small flags, white flowers and mineral water between them.

At the other end of the building hangs a row of heavily sculpted jeans, with great cod-piece pouches bulging from their crotches. Elsewhere there are reins and bridles, straps and saddles, and even a tailored denim suicide bomber vest. Here in Amsterdam, this could easily be the headquarters of a kinky fetish-wear empire, but it is in fact the new home for Dutch jeans company G-Star Raw \u2013 purveyors of \u201cmodern metropolitan denim\u201d \u2013 designed by the Netherlands&apos; own Office for Metropolitan Architecture. Extending 140m along the edge of the A10 motorway in the industrial southeast of the city, the \u20ac40m building squats like a glowering aircraft hangar. Its dark concrete shell stretches out to envelop a world of glass boxes that appear to slide past each other, the furthest cube shooting right out of the building in a dramatic cantilever towards the road, wrapped in hoardings proclaiming the latest season&apos;s trends. Emblazoned with a 20m-long G-Star logo, it is as close to building-as-billboard as OMA has yet come, a literal expression of Robert Venturi&apos;s \u201cdecorated shed\u201d. \u201cWe&apos;ve never been this vulgar,\u201d says the practice&apos;s founding partner Rem Koolhaas, sitting in the building&apos;s boardroom, flanked either side by neat men in military denim jackets, like officers from some future fashion police. He explains how they won the project by brazenly conflating G-Star&apos;s brand values with their own, aligning their manifestos, house styles, ways of working and even presenting a shared aesthetic of raw industrial chic \u2013 with concrete and steel fragments of OMA buildings overlaid on to G-Star models. \u201cIt is a form of method acting,\u201d says Reinier de Graaf, the OMA partner who led the project. \u201cYou engage with a brand so intimately that the brand takes over you.\u201d     Decorated shed \u2026 sliding hangar doors can open up the entire northern elevation. Photograph: OMA/G-Star Raw    The resulting building is as close to a physical manifestation of the Raw brand image as you could get, without using pre-crumpled columns of heavily starched denim. Floors are aluminium and white resin, while hefty steel trusses zig-zag through the rooms, everything held together with exposed brackets and bolts. All that&apos;s missing is the smell of engine oil and a techno backing track. \u201cOur initial idea was to clad the frame in bits of Somali shipwrecks, as the equivalent of stone-washed jeans,\u201d grins De Graaf. \u201cBut we were told that the stone-washed look was going out of fashion.\u201d Instead, big slabs of black concrete envelop the offices, which rise at either end of the building, before spanning like a great bridge above the gargantuan \u201ccreative nucleus\u201d at the centre of the complex. Conceived as a contemporary turbine hall of denim, this vast space is an airy world of double and triple-height studios, all connected on split levels in a big open-plan shuffle. Enticing views are framed between departments of finance and fashion, the pattern-cutting and jeans-sculpting on show for all to see, while felt-lined walls ensure a remarkably soft acoustic for such an immense shed.     Staggered studios \u2026 the open-plan hall features split levels of offices and design departments. Photograph: OMA/G-Star Raw    \u201cThey gave us the model of an aircraft hangar,\u201d says De Graaf. \u201cBut I&apos;m not sure they expected us to take it quite so literally.\u201d Outside, a row of four-storey high glass doors, sourced from a hangar manufacturer, lines the principle elevation towards the highway, forming a monumental sliding screen which can be entirely drawn back for events and fashion shows on the forecourt. Between this screen and the internal staggered facade is what the company calls its \u201cRaw space\u201d, a 20m-high \u201cflexible\u201d zone which feels, now built, like a bit of a useless leftover from the bigger conceptual idea \u2013 a theatrical trick that works from the motorway, but that seems a bit redundant up close. \u201cYou experience the building in motion, from the car,\u201d says De Graaf, \u201cso we did a lot to make it as long as possible, to maximise your exposure to the brand. It surrenders to the notion of being a billboard, rather than resisting the idea of highway architecture.\u201d     Fetish-wear \u2026 a polished concrete staircase rises to a line of denim military uniforms. Photograph: OMA/G-Star Raw    Drawing on 1950s America, and the later buildings of Mies van der Rohe, the G-Star HQ fits into what has been called OMA&apos;s \u201cgeneric\u201d phase, what De Graaf describes as \u201cthe more down-to-earth, somewhat understated oeuvre that has ensured since the CCTV building in Beijing \u2013 after which we abandoned an obsession with form and a desire to demonstrate a certain amount of virtuosity.\u201d He places it alongside their Rothschild bank in London, completed in 2011, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the mixed-use goliath of de Rotterdam, both finished last year, all of which comprise rectilinear volumes dressed in a relatively restrained corporate clothing \u2013 \u201cas an antidote to the formal extravagance of the 90s.\u201d He recounts the legend of a memo, sent by Koolhaas to the entire office from a far-flung branch of the Four Seasons hotel, which set the new agenda: \u201cUse 90 degrees only. Good luck, Rem.\u201d This general shift is also, he says, a product of the practice&apos;s trajectory away from the maverick leadership of an individual genius, as Koolhaas reaches his 70th year. \u201cOMA started as a group of people united by a shared conceptual mentality, but then the work became the person. Now there is a return towards a more collective ownership, which is breeding this kind of calmer architecture, rather than every building being a magnum opus.\u201d     Staggered section \u2026 the shifted floor plates allow views through between departments. Photograph: OMA/G-Star Raw    The visceral thrill of encountering many of OMA&apos;s buildings has always been in the number of conflicting and contradictory ideas they contain in their very fabric, standing as energetic essays wrought in steel and glass, mesh and polycarbonate, punk mash-ups of the deluge of ideas racing through their office. By emulating the generic blandscape of speculative office blocks, is the work in danger of losing its edge, producing insipid cover versions of Norman Foster with a Dutch twist? The G-Star building, Koolhaas maintains, is important for the office precisely because it allowed them to flirt with the boundaries of their practice, and embrace commercial realities as never before. \u201cWe identified a number of things G-Star is proud of, with a number of things we are never able to be proud of, because we would be criticised for it \u2013 like crudeness,\u201d he says. \u201cBoth of our companies were founded in the Netherlands, and crudeness is something that could be said to be very Dutch, but it is something we are not usually allowed to celebrate. This building has allowed us to be more explicit about our values than we have ever been before.\u201d The values of Raw \u2013 what G-Star&apos;s global brand director, Shubhankar Ray, defines as \u201cunfiltered, unprocessed, crude, naked and harsh\u201d \u2013 translates, in architecture, as a certain license to have a laid-back approach to detailing. The facade is bolted on to the structure with clunky brackets, and there are points where things don&apos;t quite seem to fit. But it all hangs together with what De Graaf calls \u201ca casual elegance,\u201d in line with the rough and rugged brand marriage of OMA and G-Star \u2013 or, as Ray puts it, \u201ctwo brands having unprotected sex\u201d. (The building presumably being their bastard love child.)     Building-as-billboard \u2026 G-Star uses the cantilevered glass box as an extended advertising surface. Image: OMA/G-Star Raw    Ultimately, it is the enthusiastic flirtation with the brand that makes this an interesting project. Koolhaas describes the model of OMA as \u201ca cross between a fashion house and a newspaper office,\u201d and the practice has long had a promiscuous relationship with the world of branding and advertising through its sister think-tank, AMO. At once complicit and cynical, the office immerses itself in the commercial world with opportunistic glee, while also managing to retain a critical distance, often pushing clients to the edge of their comfort zones. For Prada, whose experimental flagship stores, fashion shows and art foundations the practice has designed for the last decade, they also created adverts depicting fake handbags being sold by illegal street vendors. Similarly, a pitch for Adidas featured an overweight Maradona bursting out of his three-stripe tracksuit, alongside other unsavoury characters sporting the brand \u2013 although that didn&apos;t seem to go down so well in the world of squeaky clean sportswear. \u201cIt is interesting that we founded AMO specifically to deal with aura creation, to go beyond buildings,\u201d says De Graaf, who has headed up that side of the office since 2002, and overseen work for Heineken, Ikea and Cond\u00e9 Nast \u2013 as well as redesigning the EU flag. \u201cBut we have now come full-circle: our most extreme example of branding actually isn&apos;t a logo, but a building.\u201d So will Koolhaas be swapping his trademark Prada wardrobe for a pair of wet-look jeans and a denim Stasi coat?

West&apos;s US leg of the tour has so far provoked a considerable amount of controversy, namely down to the rapper bringing out a Jesus impersonator before transitioning into the track Jesus Walks. In an interview with Bay Area radio station Wild 94.9 last year, West explained that his decision to take the religious figure on tour was inspired by a discussion with a pastor.  &quot;My girl even asked afterwards, &apos;Is that weird if Jesus comes on stage?&apos; They&apos;re like, &apos;No. We do plays all the time. People play Jesus. You know what&apos;s awesome about Christianity? We&apos;re allowed to portray God. We&apos;re allowed to draw an image of him. We&apos;re allowed to make movies about him.

A decade of English cricket that began with the bang of Botham, Headingley and all that is ending with a painful whimper. With the Ashes lost (not to be seen again for 16 years) and England 4-0 down having plumbed new depths of humilation in the fifth Test at Trent Bridge, an XI of bright young things are despatched to Amsterdam to face the Netherlands and stake a claim for a spot in the side for the final Ashes Test at The Oval. In keeping with pretty much everything else that summer, it did not go well. &quot;And so yesterday it finally happened: the worst really did come to the worst,&quot; wrote Matthew Engel in these pages. &quot;The England cricket team lost by three runs to Holland. I repeat, Holland.&quot; The fact that the team contained none of the Test side barely put a dent in the humiliation. &quot;That was what made it so awful,&quot; continued Engel. &quot;These were the golden boys. This team \u2026 comprised precisely those youngsters whom everyone is imploring Ted Dexter to pick in place of the whipped and sour cream of English cricket. Now their reputation is in ruins as well.&quot; Those reputations recovered \u2013 Derek Pringle, John Stephenson and David Capel all well enough to make the XI for The Oval, while Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart went on to captain England in the 90s \u2013 but the Netherlands&apos; knack for making headlines has not dissipated in the 25 years since, as their exploits at the current World T20 have shown. Consistency has never exactly been a watchword of Dutch cricket. Their first win over a Test playing nation \u2013 a remarkable victory over Australia in 1964 \u2013 was followed up a year later by defeat against the touring Midland counties club, the Free Foresters; 1994 saw them thrash a strong South Africa side by nine wickets \u2026 and lose to Denmark and &quot;Young Kenya&quot;. That volatile combination of eye-opening results, surprise brilliance and utter incompetence reached what must surely be its apotheosis in Bangladesh over the past week or so. It began ignominiously last Monday, with the ousted Tim Gruijters making accusations of cheating and bullying at the management team who manouvered Tom Cooper into the squad at Gruijters&apos;s expense. The ICC, though, was satisfied the team &quot;acted within the rules&quot;, a phrase beloved of administrators who know a hospital pass when they see it. On the field, though, the Netherlands swiftly set about restoring their lovable, cuddly image \u2013 a catnip-addled moggy chasing a ball of string that somehow eventually emerges panting and fur-frazzled from behind the settee having knitted a rather charming sweater. Then tears the sweater to shreds and goes to sleep next to the radiator. It began sedately enough with a reasonably routine six-wicket win over the UAE. Then there was final-over drama against Zimbabwe, who needed a single from the final three balls and managed to smash six off the last having played out a dot and lost a wicket from the previous two. That, though, was just an hor d&apos;oeuvre. The main course was yet to come (as was a rather unpalatable pudding). In their final first-round game, run-rate equations meant that they needed to knock off 190 runs in 14.4 overs against Ireland to reach the Super 10 stage at the expense of Zimbabwe. What followed was, without hyperbole, one of the most extraordinary displays of hitting ever seen in international cricket \u2013 19 sixes, 12 fours, 193 in 13.5 overs. If the team had maintained their scoring rate over 20 overs they would have reached 279. That rousing triumph was followed by unmitigated disaster. Put in by Sri Lanka the Dutch were not just skittled but obliterated for 39, the lowest score in a Twenty20 international and the second-lowest in any professional T20 match. The Sri Lankans knocked off the runs with 90 of the 120 balls remaining \u2013 the shortest ever T20 run chase. So intrigue and accusations, disaster and triumph, and disaster again. And the tournament is barely past its halfway point. There&apos;s just something about the Netherlands cricket team, something beyond those results and a natural inclination to root for the underdog. Perhaps it&apos;s because the Dutch team are such a geographical and statistical outlier. In the ICC&apos;s most recent update of the global ODI world rankings (published in August 2013) the Netherlands sat 12th (a spot they have since lost to Afghanistan). That made them essentially Europe&apos;s No3, behind England and Ireland and narrowly ahead of Scotland. Europe&apos;s fifth-best international cricket team rankings-wise is (just behind Oman and Bermuda at No26 in the world standings) Italy. Then comes Denmark (at No28 in the world) and, after Guernsey and Jersey in the 30s, next from mainland Europe is Germany at No42, behind such cricketing powerhouses as Vanuatu, Argentina and Fiji. Outside Great Britain and Ireland, Europe doesn&apos;t really do cricket, at the elite level at least. Even in that other major British sporting export that has rather minor standing in the rest of the continent \u2013 rugby union \u2013 cooking the books by taking France out of the equation, still leaves Italy with Georgia, Romania, Russia, Spain and Portugal for company in the IRB&apos;s top 25. Rankings-wise British tennis might be the most obvious comparison (with Andy Murray in the Oranje role). It means the Dutch cricket team are an oddity and everyone loves an oddity, especially one as prone to brief orgies of magnificence as it is to grand displays of ineptitude. The best news? Games against South Africa, New Zealand and, ominously enough, England are still to come. \u2022 This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian&apos;s weekly cricket email.

Rose confronts the politics of identity, including sexual, body, racial and gender issues. Her themes often convey her multicultural ancestry and experience of growing up as a mixed-race person in South Africa. She skilfully combines popular culture with notions of sociology to evoke powerful emotions and illustrate the disparities of South Africa\u2019s political and social landscape.

Created in the form of a nomadic museum, Gaba\u2019s extraordinary project consisted of 12 exhibition rooms set up in various European art institutions over a period of five years in an ingenuous attempt to create a space for African art. In 2013, the Tate Modern purchased and showcased Gaba\u2019s entire \u2018museum\u2019. With a natural talent for expressing his ideas through the visual arts, Gaba\u2019s museum depicted subjects from fashion in the Summer Collection Room and food in the Museum Restaurant, to excessive overproduction of food in the Draft Room. Employing local craftsmanship with a European flair, Gaba\u2019s works vary from paintings and ceramics to installations, using a range of materials such as paint, plywood, plaster, stones and decommissioned bank notes.

With an underlying calligraphic complexity, her energetic pieces represent accelerated urban growth, and densely populated city environments and social networks of the 21st century. Mehretu creates each painting by adding consecutive thin layers of acrylic paint on canvas and then finishing it off with delicate superimposed marks and patterns using pencil, pen, ink and streams of paint. She portrays a compression of time, space and place, independent of historical significance. From constructivism and geometric abstraction to futurism, Mehretu describes her paintings as &quot;story maps of no location&quot;.     El Anutsai, Nukae (detail), 2006.

A professor in sculpture at the University of Nigeria, Anatsui\u2019s preferred media are clay and wood which he uses to create objects expressing various social, political and historical concerns. In his later works, he has turned to installation art and sewing. Using unconventional tools such as chainsaws and power tools, he has reshaped and given new meaning to materials such as railway sleepers, driftwood and aluminium bottle tops. In an interview, Anatsui said, &quot;the amazing thing about working with these metallic fabrics is that the poverty of the materials used in no way precludes the telling of rich and wonderful stories.&quot;     Ibrahim El Salahi's Self-portrait-of-suffering. \u00a9 Ibrahim El Salahi    Ibrahim El Salahi, Sudan  Often referred to as the godfather of African modernism, Ibrahim El Salahi has created visionary artwork for more than five decades. Former diplomat and undersecretary of the Sudanese ministry of culture in the 1970s, El Salahi was imprisoned for six months without charge after being accused of anti-government activities. An articulate and avuncular figure, El Salahi has developed his own unique art history, pioneering on many art fronts such as being one of the first artists to elaborate Arabic calligraphy in his paintings and the first African artist to get a Tate Modern retrospective. Elementary forms and lines dominated his early artwork, and over the years his work has taken a meditative and abstract turn, with a strong emphasis on lines, and use of black and white.

Originally from a large Kalabari town in the Niger Delta, Douglas Camp\u2019s work is greatly inspired by Kalabari culture and traditions. Employing modern sculptural techniques with the predominant use of steel, she creates large, semi-abstract figurative works, adorned with masks and ritual clothing, reflecting her close relationship to her homeland despite having lived in London for many years. Douglas Camp has had numerous solo and group shows all over the world and permanent collections of her work can be found in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, and the British Museum in London.

Most of Konat\u00e9\u2019s large-scale work is based on textiles, a readily available and cheap medium in Mali. Treating textiles as a limitless palette, Konat\u00e9 dyes, cuts, sews and embroideries scraps of cotton and traditional bazin fabric to produce his signature monumental tapestries. Konat\u00e9&apos;s major works have focused on the political tensions in the Sahel region, and, since the start of the millennium, on the devastating impact of Aids in Mali.

This is like somebody having the scepter of an Egyptian king.&quot; Unlike the Wu-Tang Clan&apos;s troubled A Better Tomorrow album, which is due for wide release later this year, Once Upon A Time In Shaolin is already finished. The 128-minute, 31-song double-album is apparently sitting in a Moroccan vault, enclosed in a hand-carved nickel-silver box. It &quot;encapsulates the Clan\u2019s legendary dark funk and avant garde sound and is produced in the original Wu Tang style of the 90s,&quot; they wrote on a new website. But the songs will never be sold on iTunes and even the most ardent fans may never have a chance to hear it. &quot;I know it sounds crazy,&quot; Cilvaringz told Forbes.

Contemporary art is worth millions by virtue of its exclusivity ... By adopting a 400 year old Renaissance-style approach to music, offering it as a commissioned commodity and allowing it to take a similar trajectory from creation to exhibition to sale ... we hope to inspire and intensify urgent debates about the future of music.&quot; They also hope to make a fortune.

The government is planning a 12-day marathon operation from Sunday in which 100,000 teachers will fan out across Burma to count the population and draw out information such as childbirth and employment rates as well as migration figures. But the count has threatened to open further the ethnic rifts that have repeatedly spilled over into deadly violence in the west of the country. Western aid workers have been targeted by angry Buddhist protesters, triggering a strict curfew and warnings from international groups they were were formulating evacuation plans. &quot;These are unarmed schoolteachers,&quot; said David Mathieson, a senior Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, of the census team. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be inclined to send them out if they might have their skulls cracked. &quot;It&apos;s still not too late for the government to call off the entire process,&quot; he said. There is little doubt Burma is in need of a proper census, having last tallied its population in 1983. Even the number of people \u2013 believed to be around 60 million \u2013 is unknown. But the census is controversial because it opens up the thorny issue of ethnicity and crucially gives the marginalised Muslim Rohingya minority a chance to have their presence in Burma validated for the first time. There are more than a million Rohingya in Burma, and 140,000 have lived in camps in Rakhine since ethnic riots and clashes with Buddhists nearly two years ago. They will not be counted as Burmese citizens on the census, nor will they be listed among the 135 officially designated ethnic categories. But the census will acknowledge they exist by allowing an &quot;other&quot; category, allowing people to identify themselves as Rohingya. &quot;We are the Rohingya. We have no other race name. We simply have no choice but to write in our proper name,&quot; said Rasheed, deputy principal of an Islamic school in one of the camps. &quot;We are losing every one of our rights, our health care, our education. We are being discriminated against from every corner,&quot; he continued. &quot;We have asked our people to stay here and to cooperate with the census and hope that it could help us eventually.&quot; But the validation of the Rohingya has angered Buddhists and sparked new protests in which hundreds assailed the offices and homes of international aid workers. So great is the desire to be formally recognised in the head count, that in recent days the massive outflow of Rohingya refugees has slowed to a trickle. Although around 30,000 people fled the camps via trafficking boats last year, and as many as 10,000 more already this year, outflow has all but stopped in recent weeks, said fishermen on the shore. Though life in the dusty camps is often unbearable, the Rohingya want to stay until they are counted. At one of the largest Rohingya displacement camps, a group of educated men who were once merchants in downtown Sittwe gathered over tea and samosas to discuss how they would cooperate with the census takers and encourage others to have their voices heard. &quot;Life in this camp has no future,&quot; said U Maung Dru, 52. &quot;There is no clinic, no education, many people do not have enough food.&quot; &quot;We hope that after this census, we might have some human rights in the future.&quot; International watchdog groups have warned the census could lead to unrest and violence since it was announced last month. The Transnational Institute, a global thinktank based in Amsterdam, has called this the most significant census of Burma&apos;s people since that conducted by the British government in 1931. &quot;However, by using flawed designations that date from the colonial era and ignoring the considerable complexity of the present political situation in Myanmar, the census is likely to raise ethnic tensions at precisely the moment that peace negotiations are focused on building trust,&quot; the group wrote. The international crisis group has also warned about dangers presented by the census, calling last month for Burma&apos;s government and the United Nations (which is helping lead the count and funding part of the census) to scale back questions about ethnicity. The current 41-point census is &quot;overly complicated and fraught with danger,&quot; ICG said in an alert. &quot;Myanmar is one of the most diverse countries in the region, and ethnicity is a complex, contested and politically sensitive issue, in a context where ethnic communities have long believed that the government manipulates ethnic categories for political purposes,&quot; the crisis group said. But an official from the UN population fund (UNFPA) said Burma&apos;s development depends on a complete and accurate census. &quot;Myanmar has not conducted a census for 30 years, and hence lacks information that is essential to planning for inclusive development \u2026 that can benefit all ethnic groups,&quot; said Janet Jackson, UNFPA country representative in Burma. &quot;Postponing the census now would likely mean a delay of several more years in making this data available to planners, undermining development efforts and the reform process.&quot; Jackson said census takers and community leaders have had extensive training to help mitigate any risks. The overarching goal of the census is to help Burma&apos;s government plan the future for everything from infrastructure and roads to schools and hospitals. &quot;The census is a critical step in the country&apos;s development process,&quot; said Jackson. &quot;It has the potential to enable evidence-driven, transparent and responsive planning and policy-making for the first time in the country&apos;s history.&quot;", "sentences": ["The Transnational Institute, a global thinktank based in Amsterdam, has called this the most significant census of Burma&apos;s people since that conducted by the British government in 1931."], "title": "Burma mobs put census in doubt as western aid workers flee violence", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/burma-mobs-census-western-aid-workers-flee", "tags": ["South and Central Asia", "World news", "Buddhism", "Religion", "Myanmar"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-28T16:27:28Z", "article": "Treacle-black plastic oozes from a nozzle at the bottom of a small tower in Amsterdam, depositing layer upon layer of glistening black worms in an orderly grid. With a knot of pipes and wires rising up to a big hopper, it looks like a high-tech liquorice production line. But this could be the future of house-building, if Dus Architects have their way. On this small canal-side plot in the north of the city, dotted with twisting plastic columns and strange zig-zag building blocks, the architects have begun making what they say will be the world&apos;s first 3D-printed house. \u201cThe building industry is one of the most polluting and inefficient industries out there,\u201d says Hedwig Heinsman of Dus. \u201cWith 3D-printing, there is zero waste, reduced transportation costs, and everything can be melted down and recycled. This could revolutionise how we make our cities.\u201d Working on site for three weeks, the architects have so far produced a 3m-high sample corner of their future house, printed as a single piece weighing 180kg. It is one of the building blocks that will be stacked up like Lego bricks over the next three years to form a 13-room complex, modelled on a traditional Dutch gabled canal house, but with hand-laid bricks replaced by a faceted plastic facade, scripted by computer software.            At the centre of the process is the KamerMaker, or Room Builder, a scaled-up version of an open-source home 3D-printer, developed with Dutch firm Ultimaker. It uses the same principle of extruding layers of molten plastic, only enlarged about 10 times, from printing desktop trinkets to chunks of buildings up to 2x2x3.5m high. For a machine-made material, the samples have an intriguingly hand-made finish. In places, it looks like bunches of black spaghetti. There are lumps and bumps, knots and wiggles, seams where the print head appears to have paused or slipped, spurting out more black goo than expected. \u201cWe&apos;re still perfecting the technology,\u201d says Heinsman. The current material is a bio-plastic mix, usually used as an industrial adhesive, containing 75% plant oil and reinforced with microfibres. They have also produced tests with a translucent plastic and a wood fibre mix, like a liquid form of MDF that can later be sawn and sanded. \u201cWe will continue to test over the next three years, as the technology evolves,\u201d she says. \u201cWith a second nozzle, you could print multiple materials simultaneously, with structure and insulation side by side.\u201d            For now, these plastic blocks, which are printed with a honeycomb lattice within for reinforcement, are back-filled with lightweight concrete, for structural strength and insulation \u2013 which would make recycling the parts somewhat difficult. \u201cIt&apos;s an experiment,\u201d says Heinsman. \u201cWe called it the room maker, but it&apos;s also a conversation maker.\u201d Over 2,000 people have already visited the site, from building contractors to coach-loads of architecture students, while even Barack Obama was shown the prototypes when he was in Amsterdam last week. \u201cThis is only the beginning, but there could be endless possibilities, from printing functional solutions locally in slums and disaster areas, to high-end hotel rooms that are individually customised and printed in marble dust.\u201d     Countour crafting \u2026 Researchers at the University of Southern California have been developing a technology that 'prints' quick-setting concrete from a computer controlled gantry. Photograph: Contour Crafting    While Dus may be the first architects to start printing a full-scale house, they join a number of others who have been experimenting with printing at an architectural scale over the last few years. Since 2008, researchers at the University of Southern California have been developing a technology, known as contour crafting, that uses a computer-controlled gantry to print structures in quick-setting concrete, which they say is potentially capable of printing high-rise buildings, with the printer climbing the structure as it grows. Another Dutch architect, Janjaap Ruijssenaars, is working on a project to print a house shaped like a looping Mobius strip with the Italian-made D-Shape printer, which uses sand mixed with a binding agent to create a form of synthetic sandstone. So far, only a small pavilion-sized structure has been printed. This looks to be where the technology will remain for the time being: temporary novelty structures for exhibitions and events. \u201cOne of my fantasies is printing in biodegradable materials for festivals,\u201d says Heinsman. \u201cYou could print an outrageous tent structure, then after a couple of years and few rain showers it disappears.\u201d Six more 3D-printing innovations Skull transplants Increasingly used in dentistry and facial reconstruction, the world&apos;s first 3D-printed skull transplant was recently carried out in Utrecht hospital, replacing a 22-year-old&apos;s malformed skull with a plastic cranium.

It comprises eight found snapshots of a middle-aged Chinese woman standing in front of her new television set. In each, her pose is identical, right down to way the little finger of her left hand rests on the TV cabinet. Save for the fact that she is wearing a different top in each photograph, they could be the same image reproduced eight times. But, where others might see only the mundane, Erik Kessels, co-publisher of Me TV, along with Thomas Sauvin, sees something much more profound. &quot;From the very many images I have seen that document TVs in China in the 1980s, these are the among the best,&quot; he says. &quot;They tell the story about how big a deal it was to have a new television in China in the 1980s. You can see how proud she is. Plus, the repeated pose is a little bit surreal. The series is both documentary and conceptual, without meaning to be either. This is the beauty of found photography.&quot; Kessels is, among other things, the most mischievous champion of found or vernacular photography. Perhaps as a reaction to the ongoing tidal wave of digital images posted online, interest in vernacular photography from the pre-digital era has increased in recent years with resources such as The Archive of Modern Conflict and Beijing Silvermine proving rich ground for both social historians and photographers who use found images in their practice. To this end, KesselsKramer Publishing, the Amsterdam-based publishing house that Kessels co-runs in tandem with an iconoclastic advertising agency of the same name, is a treasure trove of the absurd and the hilarious. Kessels trawls flea markets, fairs, junk shops and latterly online sites for interesting photo albums which he transforms into photo books that celebrate the obsessive and often accidentally artistic imagination of the amateur photographer. His magazine, Useful Photography, forgoes art and documentary for images that are purely functional. Issue 2, for instance, is a collection of photographs of objects posted by users of auction websites, while Issue 5 focuses on &quot;the standard method used worldwide to photograph cows and bulls&quot;. (You make sure the beast&apos;s front legs are on a raised piece of turf so that its back looks horizontal.) Humour is the unifying undercurrent here as it is in KesselsKramer&apos;s series of photo books, In Almost Every Picture, which has now reached Volume 12. My favourite is Volume 9 \u2013 How Not To Photograph Your Black Dog. It reproduces a found photo album that catalogues one family&apos;s attempts to solve what Kessels calls &quot;one of the biggest mysteries of photography&quot;. The results are \u2013 for want of a better word \u2013 doggedly and spectacularly awful: a series of indistinct portraits of a pet that often looks like a phantom or a blur, not least because the dog is often sitting on a black sofa. It is only though an accidental over-exposure that we finally see the dog clearly at all. &quot;There is something beautiful about the way people persist in their misfortune with a camera,&quot; says Kessels. &quot;It is almost heroic. Then, they put these bad photographs in an album. Incredible! The end result is a kind of anti-manual, a How Not To Do It book.&quot; Does he ever manipulate the found images? &quot;I am essentially an editor,&quot; he says. &quot;I never manipulate or Photoshop an image but I am looking for the story in these albums so I might move a photograph from one place to another in the narrative to shape the story.&quot; It is this trick of re-contextualising found photographs that is at the heart of what Kessels does so successfully. Trained as an art director, he made his company&apos;s name with a now iconic advertising campaign for the Hans Brinker Budget Hotel in Amsterdam, which played on its word-of-mouth reputation as the worst hotel in the city. Courtesy of KesselsKramer, it is now officially the worst hotel in Amsterdam and bookings have somehow tripled as a result. &quot;Before our campaign, it was just a bad hotel,&quot; says Kessels, &quot;Now it is a bad hotel that people really want to stay in because they can tell their friends that they stayed there.&quot; Kessels approaches photography with a similarly irreverent outlook. &quot;For me, serious photography has grown so boring and humourless,&quot; he says. &quot;All these photographers with large-format cameras making big landscapes with a power plant in the background and everything so beautiful and perfect. That is something I really hate. What I am looking for is ordinary photographs that tell a a bigger story.&quot; And every photo album is, of course, a story. On average, Kessels tells me, people made eight or nine photo albums in their lifetime, and most of the snapshots in them were taken by men \u2013 &quot;The boys owned the camera: it was another toy or gadget to play with.&quot; You can track the arc of a person&apos;s life though a photo album, says Kessels, and most lives are essentially the same. The first will be about first love: a girlfriend &quot;photographed excessively and often in unnecessary close up&quot;. The second will be about the wedding day and the the third &quot;another totally obsessive study, this time of the first child&quot;. The fourth to the seventh, he says, are devoted to &quot;the children growing up&quot;, while the eighth is &quot;a total mess: home life, holidays, parties and gatherings&quot;. The final album is similar to the first one insofar as it is about &quot;two people alone again after all the kids have left home&quot;. Back when people made photo albums, says Kessels, &quot;they were recording the circle of their lives, so there is a kind of sadness in these images.&quot;     The mysterious black dog \u2026 Photograph: KesselsKramer    What does he make of the unstoppable surge of digital imagery? &quot;It is what it is and, in a way, photography is flourishing even if some photographers are not. I read somewhere recently that the average person in the west sees more images before lunch than someone living in 1890 would see in their whole life. It&apos;s hard to make sense of what that means. Everyone can make a picture look fantastic now just by using an app, so that is not the point any more. Ideas are the key. Ideas are the future.&quot; Kessels most successful publication, In Almost Every Picture Vol. 7, attests to the beauty of a single great idea. Spanning the years 1936 to the present day, it features Rita van Dijk, a Dutchwoman whose life from the age of 16 is recorded in a series of 80 snapshots of her aiming a rifle at a target in a fairground shooting gallery in Tiburg, Netherlands. Every bull&apos;s eye triggered a snapshot, so you could say that she shot her own self-portrait over and over again. Through the album, you see Rita grow old and the faces and fashions around her change, but always the pose is the same: intense and concentrated. Tellingly, the only gap in the chronology is from 1939 to 1945 and there is only one portrait of her without the gun \u2013 it was given to her as a consolation prize on a day when the mechanism didn&apos;t work at the shooting gallery. Since the book was published, Rita&apos;s collected shapshots have been bought by the Museum of Modern Art in Holland. Recently, as flea market bargains have become rare and dealers seem to know the collectable value of everything they sell, Kessels has inevitably turned to the internet for inspiration. One of his most recent, and perhaps most strange, photo-books, In Almost Every Picture Vol 11, came from a single image he found on Flickr of a woman standing in water in her bathrobe. He made contact with the authors, Fred and Valerie from Florida, who share a passion for &quot;wet fun adventure&quot;, which, in this instance, is not quite as kinky as it sounds. Basically, Fred likes to photograph Valerie fully clothed and partially submerged in water. No matter how stylish the clothes she is wearing, Valerie does not seem averse to walking into swimming pools, viaducts, rivers or public fountains. Having convinced the couple to allow him to make a book, Kessels sent them a waterproof edition and received a snapshot in return of Valerie, fully clothed in their swimming pool, perusing it. &quot;The people I like are amateur obsessives,&quot; says Kessels. &quot;They have no limits and no ambitions. They make different choices to artists because they are not thinking of the gallery. They are almost blind to things like good taste because they are in their own zone. You enter their world when you look at their work. It is often a world that may seem strange to the rest of us, but that is also its beauty. That and the stories their photographs tell us.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 31 March 2014 to clarify that KesselsKramer, the advertising agency, and KesselsKramer Publishing are two different organisations.", "sentences": ["To this end, KesselsKramer Publishing, the Amsterdam-based publishing house that Kessels co-runs in tandem with an iconoclastic advertising agency of the same name, is a treasure trove of the absurd and the hilarious.", "Trained as an art director, he made his company&apos;s name with a now iconic advertising campaign for the Hans Brinker Budget Hotel in Amsterdam, which played on its word-of-mouth reputation as the worst hotel in the city.", "Courtesy of KesselsKramer, it is now officially the worst hotel in Amsterdam and bookings have somehow tripled as a result."], "title": "The world's weirdest photo albums", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/30/the-worlds-weirdest-photo-albums", "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Photography", "Technology", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-03-31T11:51:49Z", "article": "For all the talk of a &apos;cycling revolution&apos;, commuter cycling has remained static at 2.8% across England and Wales over the past decade. Outside certain pockets - inner London has seen an 144% percent rise - cycling is very much a marginal form of transport. We asked our readers what&apos;s putting them off from cycling to work, and we received a deluge of responses. Certain themes emerged, and we have compiled the top ten. You can add your own in the comments thread below. 1) Bad driving     Cars queueing at a junction. Photograph: pedrogers_peter    Roads were not built for cars. But they certainly dominate them now, and our readers cited dangerous driving as the most likely reason to put them off cycling.  My commute comprises roads with parked cars lining the sides, drivers passing way too close and shouting abuse when I take up the middle, and generally driving 40+ miles per hour in 30 mph zones.  anneoeyed  I wear high viz and bright lights and ride conservatively yet &quot;so what part of a big fat old bloke in high viz lit up like a Christmas tree didn&apos;t you see?&quot; is my most common question to road uses who casually try to kill me.  ID903166 2) Dangerously designed roads     A busy road in the centre of York. Photograph: Andy D'Agorne    Roads may not have been built for cars, but they&apos;ve certainly been designed for them since.  I do cycle to work occasionally but what stops me doing it more often is having to cycle on a transport network designed solely for cars: a network that has for decades so effectively &quot;designed out&quot; cycling that rates of cycling could hardly be any lower if was made illegal.  stuckinfirstgear 3) Substandard infrastructure     This Sheffield cycle path is \"particularly hazardous in the dark.\" Photograph: Tim Mullett    Last year, we asked Guardian readers to send in substandard cycle infrastructure they&apos;d spotted across the country. What emerged was piecemeal, inconsistent, and sometimes dangerous.  The most direct route from my home to work involves on-street riding with traffic squeezing past you at 40mph, and once you get to the centre having to go the long way round and cross the tram tracks multiple times due to the one way system. On the odd bit of contra-flow cycle lane you have to pray that the buses coming the other way won&apos;t cross into it.  kevjs1982  I&apos;d love it if there were more cycle paths. By providing cycle paths, it would reduce pressure on inexperienced cyclists to share the road with cars, motorcycles, buses and lorries. They have a safer alternative, which might be all it takes to convince more people to get on their bike.  weasel0bear 4) Perception of danger     Is cycling dangerous? Cycle paths that compels you to cycle close to car doors doesn't help. Photograph: Andy D'Agorne    What&apos;s more dangerous, sitting down or cycling? What&apos;s clear is that the fear of having an accident - an understandable one given reasons 1, 2 and 3 - is keeping plenty of our readers out of the saddle.  I&apos;ve always found the idea of cycling to work absolutely terrifying - even before I moved to London. All I ever hear about are people who have been knocked off their bike and injured, or worse. Granted, I have plenty of cyclist friends who have overwhelmingly positive experiences on their bikes, but I can&apos;t shake the cycling fear.  elenacresci 5) Lack of facilities     Bike racks run over by a truck in Camden. Photograph: willperrin    Lack of showers at work was an issue that came up again and again, as did frustration at a lack of space for cycle parking at home, at work, and at stations.  How many employers offer changing and shower facilities? Who wants to arrive at work wet or sweaty and have nowhere to change or to store their cycling kit? A cycle shed at one end of the car park isn&apos;t enough!  Porthrepta 6) They&apos;ve had an accident     A broken collar bone. Photograph: ID543038    This fell into two main categories: readers who have had an accident and now fear returning to the roads, and those who, like the gentleman who sent in the x-ray above, are itching to get back as soon as their bones are willing.  I had an accident about three years ago. I was cycling home form work and a black cab pushed me off the road at Kennington. My right elbow got injured, I lost almost a month salary (I was working in hospitality with no sick pay). I also suffered from depression for a few month. I tried to get back cycling but I can&apos;t. The first time a driver shouted at me after the accident, I froze and had to walk home. Never again.  alkopop79  Despite coming off my bike I am counting down the days until I can get off the tube and control my own destiny again on the roads. For the record it was my own fault. No other road users involved...  ID543038 7) State of the roads     'I had to carry my bike over this unswept section of NCR 13/136.' Photograph: David Storey    In short: pot-holes, pot-holes, pot-holes.  The cycle routes are covered in a rubbishy grit surface that is unsuitable for cycling and destroys your bike in the rain (which we get the odd drop of now and then) covering it in a concrete layer. The alternative rural roads are basically pot-holed strips with a fast-fading memory of tarmac filigree between the gaps. Our council do not understand cycling or what facilities are needed.  Houfous 8) The roads being no country for old men     Should cyclists be expected to keep up with this kind of traffic? Photograph: robichris    A number of our readers said they&apos;d been put off cycling as they didn&apos;t feel able to keep up with the motor traffic any more. This is backed up by the figures. If cycling is to be a transport for all, huge improvements to infrastructure are required.  I am still fit enough to maintain a high enough speed to keep pace with the traffic, which is important because the main risk of interaction with motor vehicles is when there is a significant speed differential between us. However, I am now in late middle age, and I can sense that I am slowing down. My sight and hearing are fine but I think my reactions are not what they were and my ability to achieve the 20mph sprint advocated in the Vehicular Cycling manuals is steadily bleeding away. In a few short years it is just not going to be possible for me to keep up.  pablo2205 9) Not being in Germany or the Netherlands     Bicycle parked up over a canal in Amsterdam. Photograph: Snakeshole    Some of our readers have made the mistake of seeing how it&apos;s done in other European countries. One hasn&apos;t come back.  We used to live in Cambridge in the UK but it was so crap for cycling we decided to move to The Netherlands. We cycle every day here with no problems at all, ever.  JodeG  I grew up in Germany and cycled a lot as long as I lived there - possibly being spoilt in the process due to the specially marked cycle lanes and traffic lights. 15 years living in London never tempted me to cycle - it just seems so backward and primitive compared to cycling facilities in Germany.  WitNit 10) Rain... and hills     Does the rain put you off? Photograph: tonicwater    I&apos;d argue the feeling of rain on your face and the exhilaration of successfully climbing a steep hill are part of the fun of cycling. Unsurprisingly, this view is not shared by all.  It&apos;s been so wet and miserable recently that I just can&apos;t be bothered to use the bike. Hopefully now that Spring is here I&apos;ll use it more. But the topography and climate of Britain are hostile to cycling and it&apos;s hard to imagine them changing for the better.

Figueroa Street, where he worked, is a boulevard of car repair shops, bodegas and liquor stores, reminders of its gangland past, and maybe the artist\u2019s earlier days as a rebel on the streets of LA. Mike Kelley comes home with the largest ever retrospective of his work at LA\u2019s Geffen Contemporary, part of the Museum of Contemporary Art (Moca), just a few miles from where he lived and died (starting 31 March through 28 July). Beginning in Amsterdam\u2019s Stedelijk Museum, nearly a year after his suicide in January 2012, it traveled to Paris\u2019 Pompidou Centre and then to New York\u2019s Moma PS1 before finally finishing where it all began. The Moca exhibit adds three major works and numerous drawings not included in earlier shows. Last Friday, Moca&apos;s new director, Philippe Vergne, who took over at the museum after nasty infighting in 2012, introduced the first major show of his tenure alongside curator Bennett Simpson, former Stedelijk director Ann Goldstein and Mary Claire Stevens, director of the Mike Kelley Foundation. A converted warehouse, the Geffen is just the place to see Kelley\u2019s often sprawling and unwieldy work with enough room to accommodate grand installations like Pay For Your Pleasure (1988), a hall of colored portraits and famous quotes, and Framed and Frame (1999), a new addition to the show making its LA debut.     Pay for Your Pleasure by Mike Kelley. Photograph: Jonathan Alcorn /Reuters    A Chinese courtyard fenced in with chain link, one side strung with colored lanterns under a dragon eave, sits opposite a globular cement form with faded colored dots populated by icons including crucifixions and Buddhas. In Chinatown it was a wishing well running with water and flooded with coins. With its chain link fence and crucifix reigning supreme over the Buddhas, Bennett Simpson says Framed and Frame refers to the history of exclusion and confinement the Chinese community experienced in Los Angeles. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about Mike\u2019s own experience in Chinatown,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn the early 80s Chinatown was home to a lot of bars, punk clubs. Mike spent a lot of time down there. Behind that wishing well in Chinatown, it\u2019s where people might go and have illicit rendezvous. If you look underneath, there\u2019s a cave and interesting things can happen in that cave.\u201d Kelley was born in 1957 and grew up in a conservative Catholic middle-class household in Wayne, Michigan, outside Detroit. After graduating University of Michigan, he moved to Los Angeles in 1976 and co-founded the proto-punk band, Destroy All Monsters. He studied under teachers like John Baldessari and Laurie Anderson at CalArts, where he earned a Master of Fine Arts. His influence on the LA art scene over the past three decades is palpable in what has been a period of growth and resurgence.     Mike Kelley in 1993. Photograph: Ann Summa/Getty Images    From the museum\u2019s own collection of 37 works by Kelley, they\u2019ve added numerous drawings, in addition to Silver Ball (1994), a massive aluminium foil-covered orb suspended nearly to the floor and wired to a series of boom-boxes emanating ethereal noise and poetry. Stemming from Kelley\u2019s early work as a performer, The Little Girl\u2019s Room (1980) is the first installation he made based on a script. This is about a little girl\u2019s dream, wherein her room is converted by a pimp-like man into a black and white geometry of grids meant to signify her entrance into adolescence. Adolescence and transformation are a constant theme in Kelley\u2019s work featuring allusions to Superman, as in his many Kandor (Capitol of Kypton) sculptures, or the rag dolls that have become a trademark like his 1992 album cover for Sonic Youth\u2019s Dirty, or his tapestry, More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid (1987).

Educational Complex (1995) is a sprawling foam diorama of all the homes Kelley lived in and schools he attended inexactly assembled from memory. \u201cIt\u2019s about architecture and how power structures, religions, history, politics and education have an impact on youth,\u201d says Philippe Vergne. \u201cSo youth for him isn\u2019t juvenile culture. It\u2019s actually a very profound understanding of what it means to grow up.\u201d Kelley facetiously said the gaps in Educational Complex were places he\u2019d been abused. \u201cThere was simply nothing I could do to counter the pervasive psycho-autobiographic interpretation of these materials,\u201d Kelley wrote in a 1996 essay published in Architecture New York. \u201cI decided, instead, to embrace the social role projected on me, to become what people wanted me to become: a victim.\u201d     Moca curator Bennett Simpson greets visitors during a media preview of the exhibition.

We don&apos;t really need any more articles, blogs or first person accounts about &quot;lifting the veil&quot;, &quot;deconstructing the veil&quot; or &quot;unveiling jihad&quot;, or indeed anything else.

A death-obsessed ghoul who kept a photo of\u00a0his mother&apos;s corpse. A\u00a0cranky, backwards-looking obsessive.\u00a0The composer of some of\u00a0the 19th century&apos;s greatest, grandest and most ambitious symphonies. Anton Bruckner was all of these things. One thing he wasn&apos;t, however, was a\u00a0writer of beautiful music offering serene escapism. Mariss Jansons and Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw, who visit London&apos;s Barbican this week to perform three Bruckner symphonies, will unleash sounds of\u00a0orchestral ugliness and visions of existential disturbance that will \u2013 that\u00a0should \u2013 have you quaking in\u00a0your\u00a0seats. These works \u2013 Bruckner&apos;s 4th, 7th and his unfinished 9th \u2013 opened up a new musical and spiritual terrain. The titanic shocks that these paradoxical pieces delivered were achieved by a man who worshipped the gods of musical conservatism at a time when the rules of composition were being dismantled by the likes of Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss. Bruckner, by contrast, spent his life exploring musical principles that had been laid\u00a0down centuries earlier \u2013 the laws of\u00a0counterpoint, the way one musical voice interacts with another \u2013 which marked him out as a cranky weirdo in the context of the progressive artistic and intellectual scene of late 19th-century Vienna. Vienna wasn&apos;t Bruckner&apos;s hometown. Born in the village of Ansfelden, he trained in St Florian, a monastery town that he didn&apos;t properly leave until his middle age, having spent his youth in a self-annihilating study of musical arcana and hours of lonely training in order to become one of the world&apos;s greatest organists. It was only in his 40s in Vienna that Bruckner felt confident enough to embark on the symphonic project that would sustain the rest of his musical life. But in doing so, he had\u00a0to face the wrath of his critics, who called him everything from &quot;a drunkard&quot; to the composer of &quot;symphonic boa-constrictors&quot; (that one was Brahms). He also had to put up with caricatures of him as a devoutly, credulously Catholic country bumpkin who propositioned teenage girls in his old age, and who once tipped a conductor with cash for getting through a rehearsal of one of his symphonies. Actually, both of those anecdotes are all too true. And as John Butt, professor of music at Glasgow University and a Bruckner devotee, told me, Bruckner really was \u2013 well, a bit of an oddball. In his diaries, he kept lists of the girls he fancied (usually in their late teens), he had a mania for counting the bricks and windows of buildings, and for counting the numbers of bars in his gargantuan orchestral scores, making sure their proportions were statistically correct. And there were even stranger sides to\u00a0this kind of behaviour: when his mother died, Bruckner commissioned a\u00a0photograph of her on her death bed and kept it in his teaching room. He had no image of his mother when she was alive, just this grotesque-seeming token of her death staring out at him as an unsettling memento mori. Butt also recalls accounts of Bruckner having &quot;fingered and kissed the skulls of Beethoven and Schubert&quot; when their corpses were exhumed and moved to a different cemetery; that Bruckner had requested permission to see the skull of a dead cousin (he was refused), and also that of the Emperor Maximilian, whose body was returned to Vienna after his execution in Mexico in 1867.     'He had a mania for counting the bricks and windows of buildings, and for counting the numbers of bars in his gargantuan orchestral scores' \u2026 Anton Bruckner in 1896.  Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images    Bruckner: death-obsessed maniac. Well, partly. But as Butt says, &quot;in the way that some obsessives don&apos;t get anywhere in life, others get there in a very quirky way&quot;. Bruckner&apos;s peculiar brand of musical obsessiveness produced visions of grandeur that are at once ancient and modern. You hear that in the opening of the 4th symphony&apos;s final, fourth movement \u2013 a chilling, dehumanised orchestral landscape in sound; in the emotional desolation of the 7th symphony&apos;s slow movement, a\u00a0tribute to the recently dead Wagner; and throughout the three completed movements of the 9th. For me, this is Bruckner&apos;s boldest compositional achievement. The symphony is the only one of his that&apos;s explicitly dedicated to God. In a sense all of Bruckner&apos;s music is a tribute to his devout faith, but the 9th dares something darker, more doubting, more apocalyptic, and more ear-shatteringly aggressive and even deliberately ugly than he had attempted before. The massively loud and dissonant orchestral pile-up of a chord near the end of the third movement is a vision of a despairing abyss that the quiet music that comes after it can&apos;t possibly console. It&apos;s as if Bruckner shrinks back from the vision his exquisitely arcane brain had led him to. That chord is the product of a passage of music that behaves entirely according to the laws of musical structure that the composer revered. Yet all that careful construction reveals something so strange, so shocking, and so disturbing \u2013 all the more so because the music has the irresistible power of a force of nature rather than a subjective, personal scream. It&apos;s a moment that&apos;s a transfiguration of all that obsessiveness. This isn&apos;t Bruckner&apos;s shout into the void, but the cosmos itself in pain. At least, that&apos;s what it sounds like to me; in\u00a0the Concertgebouw&apos;s performance, it will confront the Barbican audience with violent sonic terrors. I hope that audience is ready.", "sentences": ["Mariss Jansons and Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw, who visit London&apos;s Barbican this week to perform three Bruckner symphonies, will unleash sounds of\u00a0orchestral ugliness and visions of existential disturbance that will \u2013 that\u00a0should \u2013 have you quaking in\u00a0your\u00a0seats."], "title": "Sex, death and dissonance: the strange, obsessive world of Anton Bruckner", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/01/sex-death-dissonance-anton-bruckner-concertgebouw-orchestra", "tags": ["Classical music", "Anton Bruckner", "Music", "Culture", "Concertgebouw Orchestra"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-01T19:14:19Z", "article": "Marks &amp; Spencer is having a second go at exporting its uniquely British mix of clothing and crumpets to mainland Europe, pressing the button on expansion in France and scouting for sites in the big Italian and Spanish cities. The British retailer made a humiliating exit from the continent in 2001 when it closed or sold shops in countries including France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Netherlands and Portugal. Now it will return, with a combination of stores showcasing the best of its clothing and food ranges, as well as standalone beauty and lingerie stores in some markets. &quot;We are focusing on flagship stores to deliver brand presence and [to] stand out,&quot; said M&amp;S&apos;s chief executive, Marc Bolland. &quot;We also see great opportunities in fresh food and lingerie and beauty concepts.&quot; The retailer is already committed to prominent stores in Brussels and Amsterdam, and is looking at Milan, Madrid and Barcelona. Bolland told investors that leaving Europe had been a mistake as he set a new target to increase international sales by 25% and profits by 40%. Last year, M&amp;S&apos;s international arm made profits of \u00a3120m on sales of \u00a31.1bn. In the overseas push, the company will open 250 new stores around the world, though the retailer declined to give a breakdown of where and what type of stores they would be. However, its plans for Paris hint at major ambitions that would soon make France its largest food market outside the UK. M&amp;S made a triumphant return to Paris in 2011 when it opened on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Bolland said the store had been a massive success as he detailed franchise partnerships in which 30 food stores will open in the city over the next three years. The retailer said the model could work in other French cities, and could eventually be rolled out to Italy and Spain using its British supply chain. Standing outside the store, which is opposite Louis Vuitton, Bolland joked of a &quot;tr\u00e8s posh M&amp;S&quot;. The street, he said, was the &quot;most exciting place in the world for shopping&quot; as 300,000 shoppers passed by everyday. &quot;We needed to be here,&quot; he said. The windows feature its &quot;leading ladies&quot; campaign, featuring stars such as Annie Lennox and the chef Rachel Khoo, who is well known in France, modelling clothes that \u2013 in contrast to the UK \u2013 can actually be found in store. The relatively small stores features what Bolland described as a delicately edited selection of M&amp;S&apos;s most fashionable clothing, including \u20ac315 (\u00a3260) leather jackets and \u20ac180 white leather handbags designed to appeal to tourists and fashionable Parisians alike. In the M&amp;S branch in the affluent 15th arrondissement, the store manager, Emmannuella Pereira, revealed that French women were snapping up M&amp;S&apos;s shapewear such as &quot;suck-in&quot; pants, for \u20ac38.95, as well as larger clothing sizes \u2013 M&amp;S goes up to a size 24 \u2013 which are less readily available in other high street stores. In a country famed for its cuisine, M&amp;S is seeing British fare such Scottish pancakes and Devon scones sell in greater volumes than it does in some of the company&apos;s biggest UK stores. Andrew Crooks, the head of retail in France, said that while French shoppers liked to buy their fruit and vegetables in markets, the brand had &quot;kudos&quot;. &quot;Our customers use the word exotic,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes them feel like they are going on a little voyage and are in England. We are bringing a little bit of England to Paris.&quot; M&amp;S revealed its French business would turnover \u00a350m this year. It already has 455 stores in 53 territories, a mixture of wholly owned and franchise stores. The Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said the wholesale withdrawal from Europe had been an act of &quot;corporate vandalism&quot; by the previous boss, Luc Vandevelde.

He is a great playwright. But often his plays are ethical, you know? Good against evil.&quot; He fixes me with an\u00a0aquiline gaze, all piercing eyes and Roman nose. &quot;I am not so interested in\u00a0good and evil.&quot; Not many directors begin interviews by slagging off the playwright. But Van Hove likes to surprise. A few seconds later, he is telling me how much, actually, he admires Miller, especially the play he is currently rehearsing, A\u00a0View from the Bridge. Loves Eugene O&apos;Neill, too. Adores Visconti. Born in Belgium but now based in Amsterdam, Van Hove talks English at machine-gun pace, words and ideas rat-a-tat-tatting out in a fusillade of enthusiastic emphases. I shudder to think how fast\u00a0he talks in Flemish. &quot;It is a harsh, straightforward tragedy,&quot; he says of A View from the Bridge. &quot;It goes scene by scene. It&apos;s like witnessing a car accident that you see a\u00a0hundred metres before it happens.&quot; He mimes a collision in mid-air: boom. &quot;You just know they&apos;re going to smash.&quot; He coils back into his chair. Van Hove first came to Britain in 1998, to direct a double bill of Eugene O&apos;Neill and Albert Camus at the Edinburgh international festival. But it\u00a0was the visits to London&apos;s Barbican made by his Toneelgroep Amsterdam company that cemented his reputation in the UK. In 2009, their Roman Tragedies transformed Shakespeare&apos;s Coriolanus, Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra into an epic multimedia spectacle for the rolling-news era. In 2011, they brought Antonioni Project, re-enactments of three of the Italian director&apos;s films that used live cameras\u00a0and blue-screen technology to\u00a0project actors on to a variety of picturesque backdrops.     Antonioni Project by Toneelgroep Amsterdam, directed by Ivo van Hove, at the Barbican, London in 2011.  Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    This new show marks quite a change. As well as being his first Miller, A View from the Bridge is the first time Van Hove has worked with British actors. &quot;I\u00a0feel a little displaced,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a\u00a0different culture here. I have to learn the rules.&quot; Let&apos;s hope he won&apos;t be too law-abiding: one of the best things about Van Hove is his ability to break open texts calcified by tradition. He set Tony Kushner&apos;s Angels in America on a\u00a0stage stripped of scenery, placed an adaptation of Pasolini&apos;s Teorama on New York&apos;s Governors Island, and did\u00a0A\u00a0Streetcar Named Desire in which full-frontal nudity and a bathtub featured prominently. Toneelgroep&apos;s Scenes from a Marriage, which visited London last November, was less technologically elaborate than previous work \u2013 not a videographer in sight \u2013 but no less potent, exploding Bergman&apos;s claustrophobic study of marital breakdown (originally created for Swedish TV) into four-and-a-half-hours of theatrical fireworks. Bergman&apos;s couple was played by three separate pairs, with the audience shuttling between scenes; the denouement, featuring the whole lot, came dangerously close to a mass wrestling match: avant-garde Dutch theatre crossed with WWF. &quot;I think if Tennessee Williams or Miller lived today,&quot; Van Hove says, &quot;they would want something innovative. If you just reproduce what\u00a0they envisioned long ago, it wouldn&apos;t have the same force. I want to\u00a0push through the limits, make the ultimate production.&quot; He shrugs. &quot;That&apos;s an ambition, of course. You never get there.&quot; A View from the Bridge has its own\u00a0challenges: originally written by Miller as a short story, its features as its protagonist Eddie Carbone, an Italian-American longshoreman from the Brooklyn slum of Red Hook (&quot;a sinister waterfront world of gangster-ridden unions, assassinations, beatings, bodies thrown into the lovely bay at night&quot;, Miller wrote in his autobiography). Struggling with his feelings for his niece, Catherine, Eddie betrays her lover, a Sicilian illegal immigrant, with\u00a0disastrous consequences. Miller claimed the story had its roots\u00a0in a real-life tale, but was distressed by\u00a0its reception when he recast it as a one-act verse drama in 1955. His two-act prose version \u2013 more rounded and deliberate, less obviously indebted to Greek tragedy \u2013 is now the one usually performed, with its bludgeoning arias of love and lust and pain. Van Hove is fascinated by the text&apos;s contradictions, wrangled over by Miller during his first years with Marilyn Monroe. &quot;One moment you sympathise with the person you hate, then in the next scene you hate somebody you love. It keeps going until the end. Even Eddie&apos;s lawyer says: &apos;I\u00a0recognise Eddie in myself.&apos; I love this ambiguity.&quot; The play confronts two hot-button issues: immigration, most obviously, but also Eddie&apos;s relationship with\u00a0his teenage niece, which see-saws\u00a0between avuncular over-protectiveness and something more troubling. Van Hove pauses. &quot;I\u00a0think what happens is that\u00a0they have this really intimate relationship that&apos;s been\u00a0there for years and years. But when we look at it now, we think, well,&quot; \u2013 he lifts an eyebrow \u2013 &quot;this is a\u00a0real problem. You know, Philip Seymour Hoffman said something very interesting about Eddie, which is that his yearning is\u00a0cloaked in virtue.&quot; Hoffman and Van Hove knew each other and almost worked together once. What happened? Van Hove presses his fingertips to his temples. &quot;I\u00a0was auditioning in New York for Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s More Stately Mansions. Philip came to see me, this unknown actor.\u00a0It was before Boogie Nights had been released. I\u00a0thought he was wonderful, but I didn&apos;t have a role for him. Then, two years later, I\u00a0was planning A\u00a0Streetcar Named Desire. He was a star\u00a0by then, and he auditioned for Stanley Kowalski. He was brilliant. But\u00a0then something happened which had never happened before, and which\u00a0has never happened since.&quot; He\u00a0exhales slowly. &quot;I got afraid of him. I thought, what can I\u00a0do with him? He&apos;s\u00a0already brilliant. So I said no.&quot; He\u00a0looks wretched. &quot;It was the mistake of my life.&quot; Did he have any inkling of Hoffman&apos;s death? &quot;No. We were talking about a new project. I was in Amsterdam when I heard. I was having a drink with somebody, telling this story, I don&apos;t know why. I came home and saw the news.&quot; He ducks his head. &quot;Just vile.&quot;     Phoebe Fox in rehearsals for A View from the Bridge directed by Ivo van Hove at the Old Vic, London    Now 55 (&quot;I know, I know, perhaps don&apos;t mention that&quot;), Van Hove was part of a generation of bright young Belgians who came to prominence in\u00a0the early 80s; among them choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker and artist Jan Fabre. &quot;Antwerp was a city full of punks,&quot; he\u00a0says, &quot;We said: &apos;Fuck you, we&apos;re doing what we want to do. If you want\u00a0to scream, scream. If you want to\u00a0play music loud, do that. Leave if you don&apos;t like it.&apos;&quot; His first show, Geruchten (Rumours), was self-penned, for a cast of 30 with an audience of exactly that number. Performance art was his first love, and it still permeates his work. He sums up its appeal in this way: &quot;If Marina Abramovi\u0107&apos;s lover is drawing a bow on her, it&apos;s a real arrow, she can really be killed. It&apos;s a very simple but exact gesture.&quot; He has built a career on sustained creative relationships: his designer, Jan\u00a0Versweyveld, has been his off-stage partner since 1980, while Toneelgroep itself, which he has led since 2001, is a tight-knit ensemble of actors ranging in age from early 20s to late 70s. He has tried to replicate the model since 1997 via his residencies at New York&apos;s Theatre Workshop, where he will restage Scenes later this autumn. As is often the case in continental Europe, his productions come in and out of the repertoire for years at a time. &quot;When you know each other really well, it&apos;s like a marriage,&quot; he says. &quot;If you have a good relationship, it becomes much more interesting.&quot; Isn&apos;t there also the risk that it can get a bit Bergmanesque? He breaks into a grin. &quot;Yeah, but it develops. It&apos;s never boring.&quot; In January, Van Hove premiered an\u00a0operatic version of Brokeback Mountain in Madrid (based on Anne Proulx&apos;s novella, not the film) and recently took Romans to the Adelaide festival. After View, he&apos;s back in Amsterdam for an adaptation of Ayn Rand&apos;s The Fountainhead, then Schiller&apos;s Mary Stuart. He drops enticing hints about a major new international co-production that will visit the UK. &quot;I cannot say yet. But\u00a0it will be important, I hope.&quot; He may have a controversial reputation, but he insists he&apos;s not out\u00a0to shock. &quot;I&apos;m not a provocateur. In\u00a0New York, at first, they called me a\u00a0bad boy, Eurotrash \u2013 the man you love to hate and hate to love, all that.&quot; He looks sly. &quot;But when I do a play, I\u00a0want to do it in the most extreme way\u00a0possible.

This is one of the problems with technology communications. Tech marketers often rely on industry-accepted, meaningless buzzwords to tell their brand&apos;s story. But not only does using this language fail to differentiate your product from others, it alienates your client base, media agencies, advertisers and journalists \u2013 the people with whom you should be connecting. In the timeless words of David Ogilvy: &quot;If you&apos;re trying to persuade people to do something, or buy something, it seems to me you should use their language.&quot; So with this principle firmly in mind, here are 10 words that should never appear in your company&apos;s marketing material. 1. Disruptive How many times have you heard about a &quot;disruptive&quot; startup? Probably more times than you would like to remember. It is one of the tech press&apos;s hottest buzzwords. If your product is truly disruptive, why not instead describe how it is changing your industry by using powerful, original adjectives? Evoking an intense emotion through your story is what will connect you to your audience. 2. ProprietaryRaise your hand if you have developed a proprietary technology. Watch the sea of hands go up all over Silicon Valley, Silicon Roundabout and beyond. Does anyone know what a proprietary technology actually is? This term refers to tech that you have developed yourself, so it goes without saying that companies promoting a product will normally be promoting something proprietary. Instead, describe what your technology does and how it does it \u2013 this will be much more illuminating for your audience. 3. Innovative, cutting-edgeInnovation evokes all things inspirational, new and ground-breaking. The unfortunate thing about &quot;innovation&quot;, though, is that everyone is offering it, everywhere you look. It has become such a common phrase that even the latest mascara adverts are promising the latest &quot;lash extension innovation&quot;. The job of marketing communications should be to demonstrate to its audience how a product is new and what makes it different. Take Apple for example. Apple technology has arguably been some of the most innovative in the past two decades, changing the way we live our lives. Their constant innovation speaks through the way they advertise, how they set up their retail outlets and innovation permeates their whole marketing operation, rather than remaining a promise on a press release. 4. Industry-leading / pioneeringIndustry leaders can usually be named by the man on the street. Who are the leaders in the sportswear industry? Nike and Adidas. Who are the leaders in the TV chef market? Nigella Lawson and Jamie Oliver. Industry leaders tend to lead by example and \u2013 see above \u2013 innovation speaks for itself. If you are genuinely a leader in a field, get someone else to vouch for it. It does not hurt your leadership credentials to back this claim up with data, for example referring to a 60% market share, or by getting third-party recognition from a trade body. Prove you are a leading company, rather than saying that you are. 5. Intuitive&quot;We just rolled out this totally intuitive new design.&quot; So, this means that your product is easier to use than before. But the sole goal of technological innovation throughout history has been to make life easier for people, so improving your users&apos; experience is the whole point. 6. Future-facing / future-proofingWhen people say &quot;future-facing&quot; it usually means trying to predict what will happen next. Future-proofing is all about being careful, creating longevity and insuring yourself against disasters. Predictions and caution are fine, so why do they need jargon? 7. Turnkey &quot;Turnkey&quot; is all about turning up on the day and finding a complete solution to all your problems. Put the key in the door of the apartment and find it furnished. The issue is that marketers usually have to qualify the word with extra descriptions such as &quot;all-in-one&quot; or &quot;all-encompassing&quot;, essentially admitting that people did not understand the &quot;turnkey&quot; part. 8. PassionateI hope your workforce is a passionate group of individuals. If they are not, then they should be replaced immediately. Having passion for what you do should go without saying. However for some really awe-inspiring passion, look no further than this blog where Jeff Boss, a 13-year Navy SEAL veteran shares his definition of passion and purpose. 9. ProgressiveYou may very well describe yourself or your product as progressive. The point is that you had better be if you are working in the ever-changing technology industry. And finally, one for the regular public speakers out there 10. &quot;I&apos;m tired / sick&quot;Of all the excuses we hear at conferences and trade events &quot;I&apos;ve just got over a terrible cold, so please excuse me if I don&apos;t make any sense&quot; is potentially the most frustrating. People believe it gives them carte blanche but really it is a bad start to any talk. For 10 phrases great speakers never say, check out Jeff Haden on Inc.com. This whole blog is essentially a rallying cry to all marketers out there to heed the words of the great and original &quot;future-proofer&quot; George Orwell. &quot;Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.&quot; In order to achieve this, a marketing department must reflect the purpose of its company. From there, a concerted and devoted approach to storytelling must be taken, using rich adjectives and evocative language to describe what you can do for your customer.

Film-goers will now be able to decide for themselves. The BFI has announced, with some excitement, that the long lost film has been rediscovered in Amsterdam. The rags to riches film starring Betty Balfour, the most successful female British actor of the 1920s, who was known as the Queen of Happiness, is one of the most sought after lost films, appearing on the BFI&apos;s most wanted list. Bryony Dixon, curator of silent film at the BFI National Archive, called it &quot;a major discovery&quot;. She received an email on Tuesday from her equivalent at the Dutch film institute, EYE. &quot;I&apos;m one of a handful of people for whom the title means anything at all and I had a sort of &apos;Oh my god&apos; moment,&quot; she said. &quot;It is very exciting for us, we&apos;ve been looking for this one for a long time, so it&apos;s great news.&quot; Audiences in 1923 considered Love, Life and Laughter, directed by George Pearson, to be one of the best British films. Balfour, Britain&apos;s answer to Mary Pickford, stars as a chorus girl called Tip-toes who dreams of becoming a music hall star. She befriends a lonely boy who dreams of being a successful writer and they agree to meet back in their slum tenement in two years&apos; time to see how their lives have turned out. Pearson made many films with Balfour, in part because he was so infatuated with her \u2013 he was crushed she would not marry him.     Betty Balfour takes the grand view in the 1923 film Love, Life and Laughter.    Dixon said Pearson was one of Britain&apos;s most talented silent film directors.&quot;He launched Balfour&apos;s career and it is this film that really pushed her in to that stellar arena. She was our biggest star of the silent era. She was much loved and had that common touch, she was quite ordinary and she played on it.&quot; The discovery is important also because only one other complete Pearson film \u2013 enititled Squibs Wins the Calcutta Sweep \u2013 exists, although the BFI has fragments of a detective thriller serial he made called Ultus, the Man from the Dead. The rags to riches film was discovered last week in the EYE archives while researchers were going through a collection that arrived in November 2012. Film cans had been brought in from a building in the small Dutch town of Hattem, which, for three years after 1929, was used as a cinema. When the building was about to be redeveloped the man who discovered the cans brought them in to EYE hoping there might be second world war footage. The film comes from a short golden age of British film-making when feature length silent films were being made for the British market. After 1924 most British studios went bust in the financial crisis, film reels being removed by bailiffs and burned or recycled. It is estimated that 80% of British silent films are lost. But Dixon said the discovery of Love, Life and Laughter, which has been tinted and has Dutch intertitles, showed there was always room for hope. The big one they are now looking for is Pearson&apos;s well received world war one film, Reveille, which, interestingly for a silent film, has a two-minute silence. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it just be the icing on the cake if it turned up in the centenary year?&quot; said Dixon.     A still from George Pearson's Love, Life and Laughter.    The hope is that the BFI will acquire a copy of Love, Life and Laughter, then screen it. Audiences can then see if the critics got it right; a Daily Telegraph writer said it was destined &quot;to take its place among the screen classics&quot;. The Manchester Guardian&apos;s critic Caroline Lejeune gave it a more nuanced review but praised Pearson as an artist, as well as the film. Lejeune, who got her job on the Manchester Guardian because her mother was a friend of CP Scott, went on to become the Observer&apos;s film critic, writing for 32 generally honourable years until Hitchcock seems to have pushed her over the edge. She wrote of Psycho: &quot;I couldn&apos;t give away the ending if I wanted to, for the simple reason that I grew so sick and tired of the whole beastly business that I didn&apos;t stop to see it.&quot; She then resigned from the paper. A critic&apos;s take Love, Life and Laughter is the latest Pearson film, and legend has it that the latest Pearson film is always the best. It is certainly the most ambitious, spectacular at times in the De Mille ballroom manner, lit and photographed with a beauty to dream of. Devotees have called it George Pearson&apos;s masterpiece, and so it is \u2013 of bluff. He lights common things uncommonly, and legend makes them symbolic; he catches a series of farcical situations, and legend makes them comic; legend turns sentimentality into sentiment, and confusion into mystery. This fantasy of a chorus girl and a young poet is clever, but chiefly clever in simulating cleverness, in tickling the intellectual vanity of its audience with a goose feather, coloured peacock by imagination. It will succeed. And its success will be the result not of innate quality but of the great Welsh-Pearson legend \u2013 and, when all is said and done, nothing else matters.

It looks just like another nice place for Instagrammers to take a great bridge shot, but it\u2019s actually \u201clike an open book\u201d, he says. \u201cThe scars are still visible. People walk past, runners cross the bridge, trains from all directions loaded with commuters pass by\u2026 There are trees down the bridge but also areas of plain grass, because the soil was poisoned to avoid trees growing in order to see refugees more easily.

But Inspector Norse is actually a charming, even rather fey instrumental disco number; one that has united various strands of club culture: deep house aficionados, disco dads, hipster wallflowers and people who just appreciate a good tune. It was the breakthrough moment not just for Terje, but for a whole Scandinavian &apos;cosmic&apos; disco scene that had been quietly flourishing under the radar, populated not by your typical Wayfarer-clad Ibiza party-boys but by hirsute Vikings apparently fresh from being birch-whipped outside a sauna. And when I meet Terje in his Oslo studio, he couldn&apos;t look more Norwegian: a big beard blooms happily out of his face, and he speaks English with polite perfection, like someone laying down Scrabble tiles. He explains how a trombone-playing Brand New Heavies kid got into dance music. &quot;My older sister brought home some Dutch dance, 2Unlimited, stuff like that,&quot; he says. &quot;I was really excited by those sounds: they were really fast, energetic. All the covers would have stupid 90s drawings, all these babes in neon colours, and I thought: &apos;Wow, shit, I want to be a part of this.&apos;&quot; He studied the Prodigy, trying to work out how their beats were made, but ultimately he concedes, &quot;I don&apos;t think a 13-year-old kid can be funky.&quot; The Damascene moment came when his sister brought back Sexy Disco from university, a track by Bergen producer Bj\u00f8rn Torske. &quot;That was the first time I listened to disco in a non-ironic way,&quot; he says. Thanks to nights like Sunkissed, and producers such as Lindstr\u00f8m and Prins Thomas \u2013 both of whom have studios adjacent to Terje&apos;s \u2013 the Norwegian disco scene became one of the signature voices in European dance. Oslo, too small for a varied dance scene but rich enough to host foreign DJs in its tiny clubs, was the perfect crucible. &quot;When I started to DJ, I couldn&apos;t only play house; I had to bring funk, disco, bossa, Latin. It was usually the playful stuff that worked. Most of the reason why DJs play boring sets these days is because they think the audience are used to a certain type of music. There must be a reason why everyone sounds exactly the same.&quot; Londoners might pride themselves on their dancefloor pluralism, but even they couldn&apos;t swallow Terje&apos;s brand of Jarslberg when he dropped Ultra Nat\u00e9&apos;s trance hit Free. &quot;Everyone left the floor. I can&apos;t play too radio-friendly in the UK because it&apos;s too detached from the dance culture, but in Norway it would have worked because everything feels detached from the dance culture.&quot;            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Terje made his mark at the turn of the millennium with a series of re-edits, extending disco hits by Chic and the Bee Gees. Come 2004, he started making his own tracks, with Ragysh, Strandbar and others becoming cult hits, and he was eventually hired to work on Franz Ferdinand&apos;s most recent album. Early track Eurodans, meanwhile, was heavily sampled for Robbie Williams&apos;s chart-topper Candy. &quot;It was the easiest bunch of money I made,&quot; he says. &quot;It sounds good, except some of the lyrics are incredibly stupid. I was slightly ashamed when I played it to my girlfriend: &apos;This is what I&apos;ve done today, love.&apos;&quot; Mild embarrassment is Terje&apos;s default setting. He grins sheepishly when he tells me about &quot;an accordion gabba version&quot; he made of a house track by Cajmere. &quot;It was really fast and really hard, and no one really got it.&quot; But worst of all was when Ragysh accidentally got played in his parents&apos; living room. &quot;It sounded so incredibly wrong, because they are in a completely different generation and don&apos;t know the physics of a club night,&quot; he explains, fidgeting. &quot;If you take it out of context it can make you feel very ashamed. But I can use the album format to make music that I will play to my parents.&quot; That album is It&apos;s Album Time, and it skitters between Swedish jazz covers, exotica and cosmic disco like a foal on an ice rink. &quot;A few of the songs are ridiculously stupid,&quot; he says, picking out Alfonso Muskedunder. &quot;I could probably put it on in Norway, but never in [Amsterdam club night] Dekmantel or something, I would get a bottle thrown in my forehead.&quot; Most remarkable of all is a cover of Robert Palmer&apos;s Johnny And Mary, sung by Bryan Ferry. The collaboration happened after Ferry&apos;s son Isaac commissioned Terje to remix Ferry&apos;s Alphaville, and the pair met in Oslo when Bryan was in town. &quot;We got on famously,&quot; says Ferry, who then invited Terje to come and work in his studio. &quot;He&apos;s incredibly bright and musically prodigious. He knew how to operate every one of my analogue synthesizers as if he had made them himself.&quot; All of Terje&apos;s endeavours come out on his own label Olsen. &quot;I&apos;ve been thinking about this ever since I was ripped off by my old label,&quot; he says with residual annoyance. &quot;In these days it&apos;s so easy to connect with people, so if you hand-pick your own team you can get as far as anyone, but on your own terms.&quot; So, with a secure business and now a young son, Alf, Terje is every inch the disco dad. &quot;I&apos;m totally in love with the kid, it&apos;s fantastic,&quot; he says. &quot;He&apos;s crying a little bit, but it doesn&apos;t really bother you because it&apos;s your own son&apos;s voice.&quot; Finally, a Terje production he doesn&apos;t feel the least bit embarrassed about.

The latest centres on Bruckner, with three concerts in as many days under its chief conductor Mariss Jansons, including the Fourth, Seventh and Ninth Symphonies. It&apos;s difficult to think of any portion of the repertoire in which this superlative orchestra does not excel. But the right way to play Bruckner seems particularly hard-wired into its make up \u2013 how to bring luminosity as well as weight to the textures, warmth as well as intensity to the long melodic lines, and above all how to generate huge, spell-binding climaxes without ever making them uncomfortably overbearing \u2013 something the Barbican&apos;s resident orchestra would do well to learn from. Jansons knows his orchestra well enough by now to ensure that those qualities shine through his performance, but he&apos;s not, to my ears at least, a great Bruckner conductor: not a Wand, an Abbado or a Haitink. This was an immaculately crafted account of the Fourth, but more like a guided tour around a piece of prime musical real estate than a revealing reimagining of it. Some of the qualities you associate with Bruckner \u2013 the numinousness in the slow movement, the feral edge to the scherzo and above all the sense of a transformative journey completed when you reach the last pages of the finale, just weren&apos;t obvious here. For all the grandeur and the sumptuous sound, there were no moments to make you think, to force a re-evaluation of such familiar music. Each of the London concerts begins with a concerto, and here Frank Peter Zimmermann was the soloist in Mozart&apos;s G major work for violin, K216. With his flawless intonation and utterly selfless musicality, Zimmermann is the ideal Mozart interpreter; with Jansons and a suitably scaled down orchestra accompanying with sensible tact, not a note was out of place, and the encore \u2013 the prelude from Bach&apos;s E major solo Partita \u2013 was just as immaculately judged.", "sentences": ["The Barbican Hall&apos;s acoustics could hardly be more different from that of the orchestra&apos;s Amsterdam home, but the Royal Concertgebouw&apos;s residencies there are now pleasingly regular."], "title": "Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra/Jansons review \u2013 'Immaculately crafted'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/04/royal-concertgebouw-orchestra-jansons-review", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Mariss Jansons", "Concertgebouw Orchestra"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-04T20:00:05Z", "article": "One by one, balls of flames shot up from the towers like mini-infernos, lighting up the city skyline and casting a warm orange glow across the water below. We could hear the mighty whoosh each time the flames rose, followed by a hum of appreciation from the watching crowds lining the riverbank. The nightly fireball display in front of the Crown Casino has become a key feature of Melbourne&apos;s night scene, and we had the best seats in the house. Only thing was, we couldn&apos;t keep them still. That&apos;s the trouble with kayaks. That morning we had cycled along the bank of the Yarra river, dodging office workers with their iPods and lattes, admiring the architecture and soaking up the city vibe. But now we were seeing Melbourne&apos;s hub from a whole different perspective \u2013 on a Moonlight Kayak tour, one of the city&apos;s more unusual sightseeing experiences. Under cover of darkness, we paddled silently up the Yarra like secret agents, passing under the bridges unseen. It was magical. We had met at 7pm at Shed 2 of Victoria Harbour in the city&apos;s Docklands, like a smaller version of London&apos;s Docklands but catching up fast. Kent, our forever smiling (and ridiculously handsome) guide had introduced us to our ride, a two-seater fibreglass SeaBear sea kayak, and given us a quick but thorough briefing \u2013 life jackets, steering, paddling. &quot;Any more questions?&quot; he asked. &quot;Are there any sharks?&quot; I said, only half- joking. After all, we were in Australia. As it turns out, it wasn&apos;t such a stupid question. There had been a sighting, said Kent, but only the one, back in 2007. (It had been a two-metre shark \u2013 I Googled it afterwards.) But it was too late to back out now. It was still light as we paddled off, and the low sun was glinting off the brilliant white super yachts lined up along the pontoons. At first, we stuck to the edge of the marina, getting used to our paddles and synchronising our strokes. The going was every bit as easy as Kent had promised. But then we changed direction and suddenly felt the force of the wind whipping across the water. Warren, my fianc\u00e9, in the back, was in charge of steering with a foot pedal, but despite his best efforts we were being pushed towards the underside of a jetty. We had to use our paddles to help make the turn, really putting our backs into it to keep our distance. That was our only hairy moment, though, and we soon caught up with the others, in a sheltered corner of the marina. Kent tied our kayaks to the jetty and left us chatting with our fellow urban adventurers. He returned a few minutes later with five portions of fish and chips, which we ate bobbing about in our kayaks, dipping our chips into the tartare sauce. Kent told us how he&apos;d moved to Melbourne from Toronto for a marketing job but got sick of the corporate world. A keen kayaker, he&apos;d come up with the idea of the Yarra tours. He does daytime trips too, but the moonlight tour has been the winner. &quot;I think it&apos;s the fish and chips,&quot; he said, and to be fair they were a big part of the appeal.     Kayaking in Melbourne after dark    Energy levels up, we headed off again, out into the mouth of the marina and past the Star Observation Wheel, Melbourne&apos;s answer to the London Eye. It opened in 2008 but closed 40 days later because of major structural defects (it had cracked in the heat). Dismantled and completely rebuilt, it opened again last December. At dusk it lights up in pretty neon colours. As the sun set, we passed under the enormous Bolte Bridge, with its distinctive twin giant towers (purely aesthetic, Kent told us), then made a sharp left turn to head up the Yarra and into the heart of the city. The wind was in our favour now, so the paddling was easy and at times we let our blades rest and drifted along peacefully, taking it all in. Dusk turned to night and lights on the skyscrapers started to twinkle. As we cruised, Kent pointed out the landmarks, including the Eureka Skydeck, Melbourne&apos;s tallest highrise, named after a bloody rebellion during Victoria&apos;s 1854 gold rush. (The building&apos;s golden crown represents the precious metal, he told us, while the red stripe is for the blood spilt in the fighting.) Next came the Webb Bridge, with its distinctive futuristic web tunnel for cyclists and pedestrians; and the Sandridge Bridge, with its large metal sculptures entitled The Travellers, representing the immigrants who arrived by train over the bridge from Station Pier. We slipped under the eerie undersides of these famous bridges, paddling through their shadowy arches, some of which were low enough to touch. I had expected that we would be dodging pleasure cruisers and restaurant boats, waving to people in other boats (like you do when you&apos;re a tourist on water), but we had the river completely to ourselves. On either side of us the city night scene was hotting up, restaurants and bars buzzing, and here we were, on our moonlight urban kayak adventure, floating gently through the middle of it, trailing our fingers in the warm water, seeing it all, but unseen, from a vantage point like no other. \u2022 The trip was provided by Kayak Melbourne (+61 418 106 427, kayakmelbourne.com.au) which offers two-and-a-half-hour Moonlight Kayak tours (two hours paddling) for A$99pp (around \u00a355) including fish and chips, accessories, waterproof bags, and drinking water.

If one was that literary novels were not a good way to make money, another was that this didn&apos;t necessarily mean writers were able to produce a different kind of\u00a0book: &quot;You can write what you can write. You can&apos;t necessarily think: now I&apos;m going to write a Stephen King.&quot; But that doesn&apos;t mean writers have no control over their material or the way they present it, and it&apos;s tempting to regard Welsh&apos;s sixth book, A Lovely Way to Burn, as an attempt to reach beyond her existing audience to a bigger one. She has left Canongate, the Scottish independent publisher with whom she began her career, for a multinational giant. The new novel is the first in a &quot;Plague Times&quot; trilogy, although Welsh\u00a0has previously avoided sequels. The book is set in London \u2013 she worried\u00a0that the\u00a0Scottish settings of previous books might put people off. It\u00a0jettisons Welsh&apos;s bookish and gothic preoccupations, and the explicit gay sex that was a striking element of The\u00a0Cutting Room. Protagonist Stevie works for a TV shopping channel, is straight and gorgeous. But over tea in Welsh&apos;s Glasgow flat, it emerges that the second and third books in the plague trilogy won&apos;t share the same characters, and the action will move north to Orkney. Besides, the underlying theme of A Lovely Way to Burn is the marketisation of healthcare, and the sequel, already half-written, is about prisons. If Welsh&apos;s dystopian crime trilogy was conceived as more conventional genre fiction than her backlist, that isn&apos;t quite how it\u00a0is turning out. This is typical of Welsh. From her debut in 2002, she has been celebrated for a bold approach. &quot;Death etched, stippled, blocked, stamped, impressed itself. It tinted, printed, scraped and scrawled,&quot; she wrote of a stash of antiquarian pornography in The Cutting Room, in language not usually found on bookshop crime stands. &quot;It is just possible that in Louise Welsh crime fiction has one of its few real literary writers,&quot; said one of her first reviews. Since then she has published four more mysteries, including a reconstruction of the last days of the playwright Christopher Marlowe, and has been praised for her playful, erudite style. &quot;The great thing about genre is conventions you can muck about with or undermine,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m not a\u00a0crossword or chess person, I don&apos;t have\u00a0that kind of mind, so it&apos;s never going to be that kind of mystery. But I\u00a0am somebody who thinks in terms of\u00a0story. It&apos;s what the person in the street reads. It&apos;s not elevated, there&apos;s not this idea of &apos;Oh I might not be clever enough for that.&apos; Of course in a lot of genre novels there&apos;s a lot of really interesting, clever stuff, but we all feel we can read it. Maybe that&apos;s something else that attracts me to crime.&quot; Born in 1965, Welsh grew up in Edinburgh, the elder of two sisters. Her\u00a0father was in the RAF, her mother was an early-morning cleaner at the wire works, who took a history degree when her children were grown-up. Family life was affectionate, and Welsh was an omnivorous reader and writer of stories until she was about 14, when going out with friends took over. Two years spent working for Standard Life after she left school convinced her she didn&apos;t want to spend the rest of her days in an office, and she applied to Glasgow University. &quot;I didn&apos;t know anyone who had been\u00a0to university,&quot; she says. &quot;The doctor, you assumed, had been to university, but I&apos;d never met anyone else. So I\u00a0went to do the subjects I was best at \u2013 English, history and politics because I was interested in politics.&quot; Welsh says she was a &quot;very bad student&quot; who never handed an essay in on time, and now feels she should have studied philosophy and art history. But she enjoyed university, especially the medieval history that ended up being her specialism, and which she hopes to use in a future novel. She also loved the social life. &quot;I still go\u00a0out quite a lot,&quot; she says. &quot;I was thinking today: what do I really like to do? Probably just have a party and sit and read a lot\u00a0in between times. If I had a choice between reading and writing I\u00a0would take reading.&quot; At the moment she is focused on ghost stories. She graduated into the 1990s recession and, having worked in vintage clothes shops as a student, used her trade contacts to start buying and selling used books. She rented the back of a garage off Byres Road in Glasgow&apos;s west end, and\u00a0watched philosophy text books fly off\u00a0the shelves: &quot;In Scotland it&apos;s not\u00a0a radical idea that the person in the street could have read Derrida and\u00a0be quoting him while they&apos;re driving their bus.&quot; At this stage she had no plans to\u00a0write herself but there was &quot;a consciousness&quot; of Glasgow writers \u2013 James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, MacLaverty, Tom Leonard, Liz Lochhead. Gray and MacLaverty often\u00a0came into her shop. &quot;I was trying to get closer to the book world perhaps unconsciously, you know how actors become ushers or\u00a0box-office people.&quot; When a creative writing course was launched by Glasgow and Strathclyde universities, Welsh signed up. One of her tutors, the South African writer Zo\u00eb\u00a0Wicomb, prodded her to start her first novel. Friends persuaded her to approach a publisher at a party. She gave up her business, became a temp, and wondered if she&apos;d made a disastrous mistake. But she won a contract and a grant. &quot;I was exceedingly lucky that it came off. The timing was good.&quot; Published in 2002, Welsh&apos;s thriller The Cutting Room made a splash with its auctioneer-turned-detective Rilke and original slant on the Glasgow underworld. Welsh received generous reviews, publicity and prizes, though plans for a film starring Robert Carlyle didn&apos;t come off. She followed up with her dashing novella about Marlowe, Tamburlaine Must Die, then The Bullet-Trick, a mystery set between Glasgow, London and Berlin, which Mark Lawson writing in the Guardian felt missed its mark. Since then there have been two more novels, Naming the Bones and The Girl on the Stairs, and perhaps a\u00a0sense that things weren&apos;t quite building as they should. Welsh speaks with warmth about her first editors at\u00a0Canongate, but realised when Hodder &amp; Stoughton approached her that she had been thinking about a move: there was a &quot;very amicable&quot; separation. A Lovely Way to Burn is her second book with her new publisher. Its title is taken from the\u00a0song &quot;Fever&quot;, sung by\u00a0Peggy Lee, Elvis Presley and many others, and is also a reference to\u00a0the plague fever that is raging in London as the story&apos;s heroine takes up the amateur detective mantle. Welsh shares her home in Glasgow with the writer Zo\u00eb Strachan, her partner of 16 years with whom she hopes to spend the rest of her life. But\u00a0they are not civil partners and have\u00a0no plans to marry following last month&apos;s change in Scottish law. While she would love the party, Welsh has found the rapid commercialisation of\u00a0gay marriage a disappointment. Homosexuality was legalised in Scotland in 1980, 13 years later than in England and Wales, and when she began The Cutting Room, with its gay\u00a0male lead modelled on Raymond Chandler&apos;s Philip Marlowe, Welsh says\u00a0she was motivated by anger at businessman Brian Souter&apos;s campaign to keep the law that was the Scottish equivalent of Section 28. Though much has improved over the last decade, prejudice has not been\u00a0eradicated. &quot;Would I walk across George Square holding hands with Zo\u00eb? Probably not, no. But I probably could. We&apos;re not in Amsterdam but we\u00a0never \u2013 touch wood \u2013 have any problems; we have lovely neighbours. I&apos;m very fortunate that I can be out, it&apos;s easy for me. It&apos;s probably not easy if you&apos;re living in different parts of the city, if you&apos;re doing other jobs.&quot; Unlike gay writers including Sarah Waters and Val McDermid, Welsh has not regularly written about lesbian sexuality: her previous novel The Girl on the Stairs was her first to feature a\u00a0gay, female central character. But talking to her, it&apos;s clear she thinks a lot about the issues surrounding the representation of different groups both\u00a0in fiction and the ranks of those producing it. &quot;I want more working-class writers; we&apos;re getting more women writers than were around when I was a kid. What we don&apos;t have in Scotland is writers of colour. I know we&apos;re not as diverse as somewhere like\u00a0London but nevertheless there&apos;s a\u00a0whole sector of the population that we don&apos;t hear from and I think that&apos;s\u00a0problematic.&quot; Crime fiction, with its dead, naked women&apos;s bodies, poses particular challenges. The &quot;prone, non-active, pale female&quot; is everywhere in visual culture, and Welsh does her best to avoid it. While she loves cinema, and would like to write a horror film, she does not own a television. Currently Welsh is devoting much of her time to a project that is part of the cultural programme of July&apos;s Glasgow Commonwealth Games. Based\u00a0in the Briggait in the Merchant City, in the tower from which boys used to watch for ships loaded with sugar and tobacco arriving from the colonies, the Empire Cafe will host a week-long programme of poetry and talks exploring Scotland&apos;s role in the Atlantic slave trade. She thinks the debate around independence is waking people up to aspects of Scottish history they had previously not thought about, and could prove beneficial to the arts. &quot;If nothing else people are beginning to talk about what kind of country they would like to live in. I think whatever happens there&apos;ll be a big stooshie at the end.&quot; But she doesn&apos;t think the fairer society she hopes for would be the automatic result of victory for Alex Salmond, and hasn&apos;t yet decided which\u00a0way to vote. &quot;If independence goes through then there&apos;s another fight. I don&apos;t want to live in a tax haven, I would prefer to live somewhere where it&apos;s disgusting to be\u00a0rich,&quot; she says. &quot;Och, I\u00a0love that we don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen. It would be exciting to wake up the next day and think, what next?&quot;", "sentences": ["We&apos;re not in Amsterdam but we\u00a0never \u2013 touch wood \u2013 have any problems; we have lovely neighbours."], "title": "Louise Welsh: 'The thing about genre is conventions you can muck about with \u2026 crime is not elevated, we all feel we can read it'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/05/louise-welsh-crime-genre-interview", "tags": ["Crime fiction", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-05T23:05:00Z", "article": "In 1975, in her first speech as leader to the Conservative party conference, Margaret Thatcher declared her belief in a &quot;property-owning democracy&quot;. She didn&apos;t invent the phrase \u2013 the 1920s Tory MP Noel Skelton should take the credit for that, and the American liberal philosopher John Rawls picked it up before she did \u2013 but it became the most distinctive of all her many distinctive ideas, the one that most succinctly describes the Britain she wanted to create. Through thrift and hard work, went the theory, ordinary families should be able to buy their own homes. It would give them security, dignity and freedom and liberate them from the nannying of local council landlords. It would make them better citizens, with their own stake in the economic wellbeing of the country, they would have an incentive to contribute to national prosperity. It exemplified her belief that capitalism was good not only for the rich, but for people on modest incomes. As the then environment secretary, Michael Heseltine, put it later: &quot;Home ownership stimulates the attitudes of independence and self-reliance that are the bedrock of a free society.&quot; So Thatcher allowed council tenants to buy their own homes at reduced prices, and since the right to buy was introduced, about 1.5m have been bought. She presided over an economy in which house buying became a national obsession and home ownership went up from 9.7m to 12.8m. Fundamental to her idea was that government, which had built between a third and a half of all homes for the previous three decades, should step back. Councils could no longer build council housing. The market would provide. Houses would be built by housebuilders, to use the standard term for the companies that buy land, win planning permission and then (sometimes) put homes\u00a0on\u00a0it. Thatcher&apos;s idea is now at a point of crisis. Housebuilders are not building enough houses, and the proportion of people owning their own homes has been falling since 2007. People have long ago found that it does not always make you free to be shackled to a mortgage, still less if you cannot cross the increasingly high threshold into ownership. In London and the south-east, businesses lament the effects on them of expensive housing caused by the lack of mobility of potential workers. Debt and speculation have been encouraged more than thrift and people who only wanted a home were forced to be gamblers in a turbulent market. The property-owning democracy is not turning out to be democratic, excluding as it does the large minority who don&apos;t own homes. In a sick practical joke, people have been encouraged to take on long-term mortgages at the same time that secure lifetime employment, which might pay for them, is disappearing. As for public spirit, with rising house prices goes rising nimbyism, as owners seek to protect their investment from all possible threats, above all the threat of more homes being built nearby that other people might live in. Over three decades, a culture has been created in which the price of homes colours almost every aspect of life. It affects people&apos;s decisions about whether and when to live together, stay together and have children. An economy has been created in which inflation, otherwise frowned upon, is desirable in house prices, even essential. Property values are used as the principal tool of urban regeneration and, when those values fail to materialise, so does the regeneration. The infamous bedroom tax regards a few square metres of spare space as such a great asset that it must be wrenched from the grasp of the undeserving poor. &quot;Values&quot;, indeed, is a telling word \u2013 we use it more to describe property than anything to do with ethical or social ideals. It is amazing, beyond satire, that the two biggest stories in housing are on the one hand the bedroom tax and on the other the streets and squares of empty houses in Belgravia and Kensington, bought as investments by owners who rarely visit. At the same time that, when it comes to poor people, vacant rooms are deemed an offence to be expunged, they grow unchecked in the most desirable parts of London. At almost every level, the market isn&apos;t working, from ex-industrial towns in northern England, where the values are too low to justify repairs to existing houses, to the under-supply and high prices in London, where an average home now costs \u00a3458,000, or 13 times the median full-time income. Hidden favelas are growing up in suburbs such as Newham and Southall, with unauthorised developments in back gardens and flats occupied at many times the levels for which they were designed.     Newham, London: favela-style housing is on the increase in suburbs such as Newham and Southall, with severe overcrowding and unauthorised developments in back gardens and yards. Photograph: Newham Council/Archant    A system has been created with a few winners, for sure, but not the people excluded from the market, nor those barely able to pay for their homes, some of whom will drown when interest rates start going up. Even those who bought early enough to have a profit on their home find it to be largely nominal, impossible to realise without removing themselves or their children from the all-important property ladder. Not even housebuilders are entirely happy, although recent government policies such as Help to Buy and the encouragement of easy credit have helped their share prices rise. They grumble that planning restrictions and regulations make their work unreasonably difficult and that the margins in their business are low. &quot;It is a fantastically hard business,&quot; says one of those involved, because of its booms and busts. The most obvious winners were people such as Judith and Fergus Wilson, the Kent-based buy-to-let magnates said to be worth \u00a3180m. But here too there are losers \u2013 the people who got their fingers burned when this particular market crashed. As Danny Dorling, in his recent book All That is Solid: The Great Housing Disaster has pointed out, the home is now seen as a commodity, as a unit of investment to be traded up or down. Attachment to a place, or the interconnectedness of units to make a community, is given little value. The pursuit of ideals, the idea of social or architectural betterment in the provision of housing, has all but disappeared. Early in the last century, when Arts and Crafts architecture was flourishing and the first garden cities were being planned, the German architect Hermann Muthesius published The English House, which was based on the premise that this country was particularly good at domestic architecture and that countries such as Germany should look and learn. It is unlikely anyone would want to do this now, as new British homes have, as well as the highest prices, the meanest dimensions to be found anywhere in Europe. What we have instead are a series of distinctive if largely inadvertent types, created by a warped market, which might be summarised thus: Rural eyesore An attempt to squeeze housing units into places where people want to live (the countryside in southern England), but the people there already don&apos;t want any more. Compromise ensues, in which new houses take on a huddled, crowded air and are given a traditional style to mitigate their intrusion. Making a new place with positive and exceptional qualities is out of the question, as all the developers&apos; creative energies have gone into wrestling with the planning system to get their permission. Investment silo In London and some other big cities, dense apartment blocks are built with the primary purpose of creating vehicles for investment. Sometimes they are towers. In the previous decade, these developments were primarily aimed at British-based buy-to-let investors; currently the main target are overseas buyers. These projects typically have just enough decking, white paint and glass balustrades to allow good-looking young couples to be photographed inside them holding glasses of white wine, such that the adjectival nouns &quot;luxury lifestyle&quot; can be attached. They also have enough odd angles, or multicoloured cladding, to claim the adjective &quot;iconic&quot;. Affordable silo Similar to an investment silo, to the extent that housing associations are now the main providers of affordable housing, and are also pressured to behave more and more like property developers. Their products therefore look increasingly like those of developers, although with some reductions in the luxury lifestyle and &quot;iconic&quot; elements. On the other hand, they tend to be built with better standards of space, as housing associations have to follow stricter rules than private developers. Student silo Exploiting loopholes in the planning and regulatory systems, which make fewer demands on student housing than other types, property companies have in recent years rushed into this market. Among the attractions of students to developers is that they can be put into even smaller spaces than anyone else. The typology is similar to other types of silo, but with still less in the luxury lifestyle department. Northern disaster zone     Parts of Liverpool and Gateshead have been demolished by the government, the old streets replaced with smaller numbers of new homes. The result? The uprooting of people who wanted to stay put and zones of demolished and empty buildings. Photograph: Nigel R. Barklie/REX    Parts of Liverpool or Gateshead, for example: places afflicted by the last government&apos;s Housing Market Renewal Pathfinder project, where about \u00a32bn of public money was spent buying up streets in areas of low value, demolishing them, and replacing them with smaller numbers of new homes. The theory was that, under the laws of supply and demand, reduced supply would raise values. The reality was the breaking up of communities, the uprooting of people who wanted to stay put and devastated zones of demolished and empty buildings. Overcrowded London Flats and backyards adapted to house as many people as possible. Empty Belgravia Extraordinarily expensive houses owned by people with properties in several other countries, such that they are usually unoccupied. Often also iceberg houses, with multifloor basements expensively created underneath, to create further quantities of void. Nonexistent new town Successive governments are lured to the attractive idea of the new town, as it enables large numbers of homes to be built while annoying fewer residents than if they have been spread over a wider area. It appeals to politicians&apos; love of a visible gesture. The same governments then fail to provide the infrastructure and planning to make these towns happen. The last administration promised both a new city in the Thames Gateway, to the east of London, and a series of &quot;ecotowns&quot;. Very little of either appeared. It is not in fact so difficult to create good modern housing. There are well-known examples in continental Europe, often cited in discussions of the subject, such as Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad in Stockholm, Vauban in Freiburg, and Borneo Sporenburg in Amsterdam. Peter Hall, the planning expert whose recent book, Good Cities, Better Lives, explores the best European examples, says that there is an &quot;extraordinary similarity&quot; between these schemes: they have good public transport, from which all homes are within easy walking distance, and &quot;a good disposition of semi-public spaces&quot;, such as playgrounds and shared gardens.     St Andrews in East London: housebuilder Barratt, not always a\u00a0byword for design\u00a0quality, is responsible for this project with its emphasis on robust detailing, balconies and shared space.    Nor is Britain incapable of decent developments. Barratt, a housebuilder not always associated with design quality, has built the St Andrews and Barrier Park projects in east London, albeit only after prodding from the London Development Agency, the public body that sold it the land. Richard Lavington, one of the architects of these developments, says that the aims were &quot;to put a balcony on every unit, and to create a positive interface between private and public&quot;, by which he means placing family homes close to shared open spaces and streets in such a way that they might readily use them. He also sought &quot;clear, robust detailing&quot; that would be &quot;straightforward to build&quot;. Again, this is not complicated stuff and the developments live up to these claims. Cognoscenti of new housing will also know of fine, small-scale projects by the developers Crispin Kelly of Baylight and Roger Zogolovitch of Solidspace. Kelly says: &quot;Big windows and high ceilings are a start, and lack of fussiness \u2013 having the confidence to do things simply.&quot; Inside, he likes bonus spaces \u2013 on a stair landing for example \u2013 where a child might do homework, and outside something as basic as a bench that encourages neighbours to meet. Like Kelly, Zogolovitch likes undesignated spots &quot;where you might set up a cello or an easel or write a novel&quot;. He uses design to make small spaces feel larger and give them personality.     Kevin McCloud at The Triangle housing project in Swindon. Photograph: Professional Images    In Swindon there is The Triangle, created with the help of Kevin McCloud&apos;s company Hab, which also stresses the importance of shared space and simple design. And, when you ask for examples of good new housing, you keep being referred back to Cambridge. Here is Accordia, which won the Stirling prize in 2008, and the university-backed \u00a31bn plan to create 3,000 homes, half of them for key workers, on 150 hectares in the north-west of the city. Also in Cambridge are developments such as the &quot;Scandinavian-style&quot; Seven Acres, by the multinational construction company Skanska, which again is based on the virtues of simplicity and shared space. But these bright spots are too rare and require favourable conditions, such as having a TV personality or an ancient university to back them. They tend to be in places such as London or Cambridge, where prices rise faster than elsewhere. This helps to pay for more quality, but by definition makes it harder to achieve. The housing crisis is one of both quantity and quality. Some 250,000 new homes a year are said to be needed, but after 2008 the number fell below 100,000, mostly built by private housebuilders but also by housing associations. In the postwar peak in the late 60s, more than 400,000 were created a year, many of them by the councils later banned from building by Margaret Thatcher. Meanwhile, the private sector built at a reasonably steady rate from the late 1950s on, between 150,000 and 250,000 a year. Until the 2008 crash, that is, when output plummeted to a level not seen for half a century. Blame for this lack of supply is usually placed on the planning system. There is nowhere in southern England for new housing to go or, rather, nowhere where voters and therefore politicians want it to go. Suggestions of building anything on the green belt bring accusations of desecration of a national treasure and similarly with rural locations further from big cities. The theory that brownfields, that is ex-industrial sites, could answer all housing need has proved challenging in practice. Such sites are not always where people want to live. Suggestions for fixing the problem include, as always, the new town or, as George Osborne likes to call it, the &quot;garden city&quot;. He used the term when repackaging existing proposals for Ebbsfleet in Kent, and presenting them as his invention, but his duplicity should not obscure the possibility that it might be a good idea. Peter Hall passionately believes that the principal hope for housing is building new towns and town-size extensions to existing cities. The new towns created in the 1960s, of which Milton Keynes is the biggest and best known, may have become the butt of patronising jokes, but, says Hall, &quot;were really rather successful&quot;. They did their job of relieving pressure and &quot;all the evidence shows that people like living there&quot;. Another idea is to fit more homes into London, which is several times less densely populated than, for example, Paris. Another is to encourage people to build their own houses, which currently accounts for a minute proportion of the total. Another, popular with the current government, is the &quot;neighbourhood plan&quot;. Here, local communities (usually rural) put together their own proposals for development so that some of the proceeds go to shared benefits and growth is no longer an aggressive intervention by outsiders. It might also help if we moved away from the preoccupation of home ownership with the help of decent properties for private rent. Michael Heseltine once said that &quot;there is in this country a deeply ingrained desire for home ownership&quot;, but in 1900 90% of homes, at almost every level of price, were rented. All these suggestions have merit and the answer is almost certainly to embrace all of them and more. We have to go from our current culture, where new housing is treated as pollution, and something to be squeezed through the planning system with the greatest difficulty, to one where it is seen as a positive asset. There is a vicious circle \u2013 new development is poor because it takes so much effort to overcome objections and people object to it because it is poor. But none of these ideas will happen without the thing the coalition has been least willing to employ, which is active and forward-looking public intervention. It is hard to build a new town, or a well considered rural expansion, without things such as compulsorily buying land, paying professionals to plan it or providing transport. As Dickon Robinson, formerly of housing association the Peabody Trust puts it: &quot;The market has failed. It&apos;s time to put some controversial ideas out there.&quot; The compulsory purchase by government from private landowners sounds communist, but it was used (for example) in the &quot;renewal&quot; of northern cities. It is just that politicians are more reluctant to wield it in Kent than in Gateshead. If we are sceptical about the power of planners to achieve their objectives, we only need to look at the Netherlands. There, they had a similar scale of housing shortage, in proportion to the country&apos;s size, to the one that has been diagnosed in Britain for the past 15 years. Unlike Britain, they fixed it, by building nearly half a million new homes. Planning apart, there is a deep flaw with the idea that the market alone will meet all the country&apos;s housing needs. The problem is not only to do with the numbers supplied, but with how much each home costs and housebuilders cannot be expected to lead a process that results in the value of their product going down. They would rather sit on their land until such time as its price goes up, which means that some other agency has to do what they won&apos;t, which means, in effect, that the government has to intervene more actively in promoting building \u2013 by acquiring land, producing considered plans for its development, and then promoting such development. Given that in much of Britain the price of homes is high, a slow deflation might be desirable; the ideal could be that prices stay the same, so that they gently fall in real terms. But the coalition&apos;s big idea is the opposite. With Help to Buy, changing pension rules and other measures, they have stimulated demand without a corresponding increase in supply, such that prices go up further. As the Financial Times has said, this is economically illiterate. It would be a useful first step to reverse these policies. We are now at a moment similar to the 1970s, when ideas about housing that had lasted a generation stopped working. Then it was the legacy of Clement Attlee&apos;s postwar government, which believed in massive state provision of housing, but which ended up restricting freedoms and too often creating homes people didn&apos;t like. Thatcher&apos;s policies were a necessary corrective, and had real benefits, but now they too are failing. It is time for something new. It&apos;s not easy to champion planning, as it tends to summon images of faceless bureaucrats and grandiose visions gone wrong. But, as Hermann Muthesius recognised in the early 1900s, and as Peter Hall argues about 1960s new towns, it is not un-British to plan and design new communities well. The national dependency on high house prices has, in its effects, become an economic, social and cultural disaster. Active intervention is needed.

That said, the performance of the uncompleted Ninth was superior as a Brucknerian musical experience to the high-quality but rather unimaginative account of the Seventh the previous evening. The long, lonely musical lines of the Seventh need more room to breathe and blossom than Jansons, always keen to press on, allowed. It says something about the performance that the trio section of the third-movement scherzo, a meadow among the surrounding peaks, had more Brucknerian reflectiveness than the grander and more iconic passages. Jansons did not linger in the Ninth, either, but either the ear had adjusted to his polished approach or he simply found more to say here. The darkness of the symphony&apos;s opening was magnificently played and the great effortfulness of the closing adagio rightly left all the big questions unresolved. Most original of all was Janson&apos;s deconstruction of the pounding motto theme of the scherzo, with the weighty emphasis of the brass rhythm carefully contrasted to powerful\u00a0effect with the quicker stabbing staccato in the woodwinds and\u00a0strings that follows.

But how many of you would feel safe and happy enough to make them by bike? If you are one of those millions of people who would like to cycle (or cycle more) but won\u2019t because of the dangers, then the very idea of making these local trips by bike is forbidding.

These range from installing protected cycle lanes to filtering out through traffic from residential areas; from creating safe routes to local schools to opening up green spaces to considerate cycling. Hang on, you might think: why this sudden focus on the boroughs \u2013 isn\u2019t it the mayor, Boris Johnson, who\u2019s got the levers of power?  It\u2019s true that creating high-quality long-distance cycle superhighways or ripping out and replacing London\u2019s dangerous monster junctions lies principally within the mayor\u2019s ambit; but the mayor and TfL actually control only 5% of London\u2019s roads (albeit with a much higher share of the total motor traffic). To his credit, the mayor promised to meet in full the demands of our 2012 Love London, Go Dutch campaign. We now need London\u2019s boroughs to also step up and help unlock the massive potential there exists for cycling \u2013 most of which will be realised in short, local journeys on their patch. People often tell me that we can\u2019t match the best of Europe, because London is much bigger than cities such as Amsterdam or Copenhagen. But London is famously a collection of villages \u2013 every single town centre can be its own Amsterdam. And just as splashes of ink on blotting paper spread and connect, so too will we grow space for cycling everywhere in London by seeding it in every ward in every borough. Indeed, we can do the same in all our great cities. If the enthusiasm that has so far greeted Space for Cycling is anything to go by, it\u2019s a popular call to action whose moment has come. For the first time a cycling campaign is being supported by a major retailer, Evans Cycles and a trade body, the Bicycle Association.  It will help address so many issues, from childhood obesity to local economic revitalisation. It\u2019s a clear, simple idea and one of the best things that local councils can do for their citizens.

The flaw, dubbed &quot;Heartbleed&quot;, could reveal anything which is currently being processed by a web server \u2013 including usernames, passwords and cryptographic keys being used inside the site. Those at risk include Deutsche Bank, Yahoo and its subsidiary sites Flickr and Tumblr, photo-sharing site Imgur, and the FBI.  About half a million sites worldwide are reckoned to be insecure. &quot;Catastrophic is the right word,&quot; commented Bruce Schneier, an independent security expert. &quot;On the scale of 1 to 10, this is an 11.&quot;  But suggestions by Yahoo and the BBC that people should change their passwords at once \u2013 the typical reaction to a security breach \u2013 could make the problem worse if the web server hasn&apos;t been updated to fix the flaw, says Mark Schloesser, a security researcher with Rapid7, based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Doing so &quot;could even increase the chance of somebody getting the new password through the vulnerability,&quot; Schloesser said, because logging in to an insecure server to change a password could reveal both the old and new passwords to an attacker. The bug exists in a piece of open source software called OpenSSL, which is meant to encrypt communications between a user&apos;s computer and a web server. But security researchers have no way to prove whether or not the flaw, which has existed since at least March 2012, has been exploited. The bug&apos;s age, and its presence in software to which anyone can submit an update, has led to speculation that it could have been inserted and then exploited by government spy agencies such as the US&apos;s National Security Agency, which is known to have programs aiming to collect user data. &quot;My guess is accident, but I have no proof,&quot; Schneier commented. Tumblr, which is affected, issued a warning to its users on Tuesday night. Although the firm said it had &quot;no evidence of any breach&quot;, and has now fixed the issue on its servers, it recommends users take action. &quot;This might be a good day to call in sick and take some time to change your passwords everywhere \u2014 especially your high-security services like email, file storage, and banking, which may have been compromised by this bug,&quot; it says. The advice to change passwords was repeated elsewhere, by groups including the BBC. But Rapid7&apos;s Schoessler cautioned against doing that. &quot;The estimate is that the larger providers all get patched within the next 24-48 hours [Thursday to Friday afternoon] and I would agree that people should change their credentials when a provider has updated their OpenSSL versions.&quot; Users can check whether a specific site remains vulnerable to Heartbleed with a tool put together by developer Filippo Valsorda. The Heartbleed vulnerability is only found in a few recent releases of OpenSSL, a software library that lets web servers initiate secure conversations. In affected versions, it lets attackers potentially read content out from the active memory of a web server.  While some servers have fixed the OpenSSL flaw, the cascading nature of the problem means that they may not be fully safe. The flaw lets a determined attacker steal the private key to a site&apos;s SSL certificate, the code that enables all communications with the server to be held securely. Sites which have updated OpenSSL but are still using the same certificate as before \u2013 such as Deutsche Bank&apos;s main consumer portal in Germany \u2013 may show up as secure on initial inspection, but remain easy for attackers to penetrate. &quot;Risk to users exist until organisations have updated OpenSSL, acquired a new certificate, generated and deployed new SSL keys, and revoked old keys and certs,&quot; says Trey Ford, global security strategist at Rapid7. &quot;Until this is done, attacks may still be able to steal cookies, sessions, passwords, and the key material required to masquerade as the website.&quot; Yahoo was one of the sites worst affected by Heartbleed, but the firm has now fixed its main properties, including subsidiaries Flickr and Tumblr, and says it is &quot;working to implement the fix across the rest of our sites&quot;. &quot;We\u2019re focused on providing the most secure experience possible for our users worldwide and are continuously working to protect our users\u2019 data,&quot; a Yahoo spokesperson added. \u2022 &apos;Heartbleed&apos;: hundreds of thousands of servers at risk around the world from catastrophic bug", "sentences": ["&quot;On the scale of 1 to 10, this is an 11.&quot;  But suggestions by Yahoo and the BBC that people should change their passwords at once \u2013 the typical reaction to a security breach \u2013 could make the problem worse if the web server hasn&apos;t been updated to fix the flaw, says Mark Schloesser, a security researcher with Rapid7, based in Amsterdam, Netherlands."], "title": "Heartbleed:  don't rush to update passwords, security experts warn", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/09/heartbleed-dont-rush-to-update-passwords-security-experts-warn", "tags": ["Internet", "Internet safety", "Technology", "Data and computer security", "Hacking", "Open source", "Yahoo", "Tumblr"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-09T21:43:33Z", "article": "Exotic spies, heroes, and known and suspected communists feature in top-secret MI5 files available online for the first time on Thursday to mark the 100th anniversary of the first world war. Mata Hari, Edith Cavell, Sir Roger Casement, Arthur Ransome, Sidney Reilly, a leading suffragette and the Boy Scouts were among those MI5 kept under surveillance in its early years as Britain&apos;s Security Service. Mata Hari, one of history&apos;s most celebrated honey-trap spies, first came to MI5&apos;s attention in December 1915 when she arrived at Folkestone on the Dieppe boat train. She admitted her destination was The Hague to be near her lover Baron Van der Capellen, a colonel in the Dutch Hussars. The following year, MI5&apos;s informant in The Hague, codenamed &quot;T&quot;, reported: &quot;Mata Hari is a demi-mondaine who is in relation with highly placed people and during her sojourn in France she made the acquaintance of many French and Belgian officers. She is suspected of having been to France on an important mission for the Germans.&quot; In November 1916, questioned by MI5, Mata Hari claimed that a French consul in Spain had subsequently asked her to go to Austria to spy on that country&apos;s forces. A renowned dancer, Mata Hari was a Dutch divorcee born Marguerite Gertrude Zelle in the Dutch East Indies. A French intelligence report dated 22 May 1917, shown to a MI5 officer in Paris, noted: &quot;Mata Hari today confessed that she has been engaged by Consul Cremer of Amsterdam for the German Secret Service. She was paid 20,000 francs in advance.&quot; She was shot by a French firing squad in 1917. Edith Cavell, a British nurse at a Red Cross hospital in Belgium, was executed by a German firing squad in October 1915 for helping 200 allied soldiers to escape. The files in the National Archives show that British diplomats clung to the hope that Germany would not execute a woman who was regarded as a heroine. An MI5 agent in Li\u00e8ge said he had been told by a reliable source that &quot;the two spies who denounced Nurse Cavell have both been killed, one by a bullet in the head, the other by a dagger thrust in the chest&quot;. Sir Roger Casement, a British consul in Africa and South America knighted for his work in exposing the exploitation and slaughter of Africans and South American Indians, and Sidney Reilly, a naturalised Russian Jew dubbed the Ace of Spies, are other victims of espionage who feature among the 150 MI5 files. Casement was arrested on a beach in Co Kerry, three days before the 1916 Easter rising, after landing in a boat that had picked him up from a German submarine. A trawler accompanying the submarine and carrying 20,000 guns was scuttled after being intercepted. The MI5 documents show Casement knew the Easter rising was doomed to failure after Germany reneged on its promises to send troops to help the rebels. The UK government used his &quot;black diaries&quot; to smear him and sabotage a campaign to save his life. &quot;I have done nothing dishonourable, as you will one day learn,&quot; he told Frank Hall, a senior MI5 officer. Casement was hanged in Pentonville prison on 3 August 1916. Reilly was recruited to work for the British secret intelligence service, MI6. When he died in 1925 the Russians claimed a guard had shot him as he crossed the border with Finland. MI5 documents suggest he was executed by Bolsheviks in 1925. Reilly had many wives, according to MI5. A Special Branch informer reported that his second wife, actress Pepita Bobadilla, went to the Russian embassy in Paris following his death. As she applied for a visa, she told the Russians her husband had been &quot;spying for the British government&quot;. Arthur Ransome, author of Swallows and Amazons, caught MI5&apos;s attention as correspondent for the Manchester Guardian in Moscow who married Trotsky&apos;s secretary, Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina. British officials told MI5 that Ransome was &quot;exceedingly clever and interesting fellow \u2013 but an out and out Bolshevist&quot;. The British consul and MI6 officer in Moscow, Robert Bruce Lockhart, soon corrected them. Ransome, who was given the codename S76, was a valuable intelligence asset during the chaos of the Russian revolution, he said. The files include one on the suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst, one of MI5&apos;s later targets. MI5 noted that in 1940 she wrote to Viscount Swinton, chairman of a committee investigating Fifth Columnists, sending him a list of active Fascists still at large and of anti-Fascists who had been interned. A copy of the letter includes a note by Swinton, saying: &quot;I should think a most doubtful source of information.&quot; The files also show how MI5 was concerned that the Boy Scouts were being infiltrated by Communists after the first world war.

Among them was his Fourth Symphony, subtitled &quot;Tansman Episodes&quot; and intended as a tribute to fellow Polish composer Alexsandre Tansman. Unlike G\u00f3recki&apos;s Third Symphony, the Symphony Of Sorrowful Songs, the Fourth is a purely orchestral work, with important solo roles for piano and organ, and closer in style to his later chamber music than its symphonic predecessor.

At the London jazz festival of 2007 he made his presence known again, with an orchestra that added a free-jazzy edge to traditional big-band swagger, and a raft of powerful original tunes. A fine composer and a trumpeter distinguished by a mix of brashness and subtlety, Tolliver has tweaked the hard-bop style with post-60s jazz innovations. He returns to London for a one-off show with the current edition of his Music Inc quintet, including acclaimed young New York pianist Theo Hill and former Herbie Hancock drummer Gene Jackson.

In its latest investigations into neglected foodstuffs \u2013 following on from headline-grabbing work with insects \u2013 Copenhagen&apos;s Nordic Food Lab has been exploring the potential of pig&apos;s blood. &quot;Perhaps it&apos;s been associated with poverty, and it is tricky to work with because it coagulates quickly,&quot; says the Lab&apos;s head of research, Edinburgh-born Ben Reade. &quot;We were talking one day about offal and I mentioned some blood macarons I had at Mugaritz in Spain to Elisabeth Paul, who&apos;s a meat scientist, and that got her thinking.&quot; Paul focused on blood&apos;s potential as an egg substitute, using it to develop recipes for pancakes, ice-cream, meringues and, in tribute to her German homeland, a black forest gateau (if you want to try yourself, 65g of blood is equivalent to an egg). &quot;The blood pancakes are my favourite,&quot; says Reade. &quot;Salty, umami, a bit sweet \u2013 and it&apos;s a delicious texture.&quot; @nordicfoodlab Michael Booth 2 The rise and rise of Bristol Having been home to both George Perry\u2011Smith&apos;s groundbreaking restaurant The Hole in the Wall in Bath, and Joyce Molyneux&apos;s Carved Angel in Dartmouth, the West Country long ago earned its place in the story of\u00a0British food. In the past couple of years it is Bristol in particular that has laid claim to having the most interesting emerging restaurant sector in the country. It&apos;s not just the knowing modernism of the Sanchez brothers at\u00a0Casamia or the more formal flash of\u00a0Wilkes, both recognised by a certain\u00a0French tyre company. It lies in the gutsier, more robust cooking and laid back vibe\u00a0at the likes of Flinty\u00a0Red\u00a0with its small plates, the smokey woodfired oven of Bristol Lido, the recently reborn Bell&apos;s Diner, glorious steaks at the Ox, and the terrific Wallfish Bistro,\u00a0on the site of\u00a0what was the great Keith Floyd&apos;s first business. No wonder Mitch Tonks has decided to open one of the first of his classy seafood chain, Rockfish here. Jay Rayner 3 Kelis&apos;s food truck The music world is full of foodies, from Franz Ferdinand&apos;s Alex Kapranos \u2013 who once wrote a taste-based tour diary for the Guardian \u2013 to Action Bronson and his penchant for rapping about barbecued venison. Kelis out-foodies them all, though: a Cordon Bleu-trained saucier with her own cookery show, her latest album is called Food and features tracks such as Jerk Ribs and Fish Fry. It&apos;s these credentials that made her appearance running a food truck at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, more than just the average PR stunt. Rather than simply put her name to proceedings, Kelis hired out a kitchen on the outskirts of the city and spent a couple of days frantically prepping all the food with her small team, before getting in the van to serve punters herself. On the menu were jerk BBQ goat ribs, shredded beef sliders with a cherry BBQ sauce and duck confit sliders with a ginger sesame glaze: the beef sliders won this writer&apos;s vote: tender, succulent with just the right hint of sweetness, although all three were superior to most of the stalls you&apos;ll find on a British street-food setup such as Kerb. iamkelis.com Tim Jonze 4 Fernet Branca It&apos;s enjoying another resurgence. Fergus Henderson tell us why: &quot;Fernet is a miracle, curing all known ailments, even esoteric complaints such as a broken heart. When in need of nursing it&apos;s a good time to reflect on what a debt we owe the family Branca for making the elixir; they have scoured all corners of the world for their ingredients, which include frankincense, myrrh, saffron, roots, bark, essential oil of mint and more. It is no wonder then that you can follow its route through you, soothing each organ on its way down. &quot;My wise father pointed me in the direction of Fernet Branca. He took it in the form of a cocktail: two parts Fernet to one part cr\u00e8me de menthe, served on ice. Even though I prefer to take my Fernet straight, I can see the benefits of a Dr Henderson (as the drink has become to be known) at about five in the afternoon when you have had a good lunch and some of your vital organs are playing up. The Dr Henderson gives you a minty freshness to set you up for the evening.&quot; thewhiskyexchange.com 5 Spiteri and son     Fin and Jon Spiteri. Photograph: Suki Dhanda for Observer Food Monthly     Jon Spiteri was a founding partner with Fergus Henderson and Trevor Gulliver at St John in Smithfield 20 years ago and has since worked his ma\u00eetre d&apos; magic around much of London, from Corrigan&apos;s in Mayfair to\u00a0the Royal Academy&apos;s Keeper&apos;s House. But it was at Jeremy Lee&apos;s revitalised Quo Vadis that he lit\u00a0up the room, returning a light touch\u00a0of louche to the Hart brothers&apos; faded Soho restaurant. So when Russell Norman wanted a would-be waiter to learn about the importance of good service in an episode of his BBC2 show The Restaurant Man, he inevitably turned to Spiteri and son (another brother, Lorcan, works in the QV kitchen). Fin has inherited his father&apos;s taste in\u00a0tailored suits and his sensitivity to the mood in a room. Both, though, have\u00a0since moved on \u2013 Fin is now working with his mother Melanie and Margot Henderson at the cult Shoreditch cafe, Rochelle Canteen, while Jon is adding an elegant charm to the new Holborn Dining Room. Allan Jenkins 6 The new Paris A more relaxed approach to eating out is taking hold in the French capital, with innovative young chefs from around the world opening low key restaurants and doing simple things to fantastic ingredients. Bones in the 11th arrondissement is a good example: opened in January last year, the small dining room overseen by 32-year-old Australian chef James Henry turns out superior bar snacks such as smoked oysters, duck hearts with gremolata, exemplary charcuterie and dishes such as cuttlefish, beetroot and horseradish\u00a0&quot;snow&quot;. Hip no-reservations seafood bar Clamato, (next door to revered sister restaurant Septime in the 11th) draws a cool crowd with its baked razor clams with crushed peanuts and herb butter, and octopus carpaccio with grapefruit pulp and anchovy. Even more unassuming is Miznon in Le Marais, whose menu is based around house-baked pitta breads. The\u00a0magic is in the fillings and side dishes (chargrilled monkfish with chilli sauce, whole roast cauliflower), proof there&apos;s talent in the unprepossessing kitchen. bonesparis.com; lefooding.com/en/restaurants/restaurant-clamato-paris; facebook.com/miznonparis Eleanor Morgan 7 Roy Choi     Roy Choi. Photograph: Barry J Holmes for Observer Food Monthly    Six years ago, Roy Choi was the chef of a ritzy hotel. Some years before that he was a degenerate gambler, and before that he was a low-rider cruising Los Angeles looking for trouble. He&apos;s also been a jewellery hustler, a brawler, a busboy at his family&apos;s Korean restaurant, a student of the Culinary Institute of America, and a cook at Le Bernardin in New York City. And now? He is a magnate, and his brand is a movement. It began on the sidewalk. You stand with a paper tray in one hand, legs spread to shoulder width, a slight hunch in your back as you lean over the tray to avoid spillage on your shoes and shirt. Pinched between the fingers of your other hand is a tortilla \u2013 a crisp flour one if it&apos;s a &quot;blackjack&quot; quesadilla filled with pork belly and cheese; a soft corn one if it&apos;s a taco topped with sweet, smoky Korean-style barbecue short rib \u2013 procured from Choi&apos;s roving Kogi taco truck. The flavours are an idiosyncratic homage to LA, remixing and mingling the various parts of Choi&apos;s upbringing in this sprawling city of a hundred identities and as many ethnic groups. But as the shiny food trucks that now congest the streets of cities the world over show, the idea has universal appeal. You may even have had a &quot;Korean taco&quot; by now. Thank Roy. Choi&apos;s fleet has grown, and now includes four brick-and-mortar restaurants: Chego, A-Frame, Sunny Spot and the newly opened POT. Situated inside the Line hotel, right in the heart of LA&apos;s Koreatown, POT signals Choi&apos;s return to the hotel business. It is also a symbolic homecoming for a chef who spent most of his career avoiding the food of his heritage. &quot;I grew up in the 80s and the late part of the 70s. Being Asian wasn&apos;t like what it is now. In my generation it was really hard to break out of the mould,&quot; Choi says. &quot;Cooking was a last way out. It was my voice of freedom to not cook Asian food. I found my way back to Asian food when I was ready.&quot; Koreatown, with its neon-lit streets and all-night karaoke bars, may not be where you&apos;d expect to find a cook of Choi&apos;s calibre. But he is hellbent on spreading his food to places traditionally neglected by restaurateurs. The Kogi truck&apos;s mobility is its core value: &quot;We&apos;re not out there for the coolness factor. We&apos;re out there to feed people. There&apos;s some point in everyone&apos;s life when they didn&apos;t have a lot of money.&quot; His food is &quot;a handshake to whoever is out there. If you&apos;re just chilling on the couch, you ain&apos;t got no money, you can&apos;t figure out what to do. Wherever you are in life, here you go. I understand what you&apos;re going through.&quot; eatatpot.com Chris Ying 8 Have a butcher&apos;s A new breed of restaurant is offering diners a more direct relationship with the meat they serve. Farringdon&apos;s Quality Chop House in London opened a butcher&apos;s shop in December and in March 23-year-old Luca Mathiszig-Lee joined butcher Tom Richardson Hill and chef Alex Szrok (of The Eagle) to open Hill &amp; Szrok Master Butcher &amp; Cookshop on Broadway Market. In Queens, New York, Butcher Bar&apos;s motto sums up the trend: &quot;We cook what we sell and sell what we cook.&quot; thequalitychophouse.com; @Hillandszrok EM 9 PPC magazine&apos;s 100th issue  Before photo-saturated food porn, before Fool magazine, Cereal and Lucky Peach, there was Petits Propos Culinaires, founded in 1979 by a stellar panel of Alan and Jane Davidson, Elizabeth David and Richard Olney, largely as a vehicle to publish recipes that could run in Olney&apos;s Good Cook book series for Time/Life. David contributed three pieces to PPC issue one \u2013 Hunt the Ice Cream; Good Hay, Sweet Hay; and A True Gentlewoman&apos;s Delight \u2013 while Olney wrote a recipe for crayfish \u00e0 la bordelaise, under the unlikely pseudonym of Tante Ursule (Aunt Ursula). Now edited and published three times a year by Tom Jaine, Petits Propos Culinaires is about to publish its bumper 100th issue, including a look at New York&apos;s Lower East Side, a history of the Cornish pasty and camp cookery in the days of the Raj. It is an eclectic feast for the mind \u2013 and it is still determinedly photo-free. prospectbooks.co.uk/ppc AJ 10 Koppi coffee Two former Swedish barista champions, Anne Lunell and Charles Nystrand, have been roasting their own beans in Helsingborg, in south Sweden, and selling them under the Koppi brand since 2007. Recently, small quantities of their coffee have been cropping up in London \u2013 if you see a bag, snap it up. The Ndaroini, a Kenyan coffee with blackberry and rosehip notes, is particularly good. South London cafe/restaurant M1lk stocks them, as will Lyle&apos;s, the new restaurant from Young Turks chef James Lowe, when it opens in Shoreditch next month. Or order online \u2013 shipping of six bags or more is free. koppi.se KF 11 World-class world cup drinking Cacha\u00e7a \u2013 rum&apos;s flavourful Brazilian cousin \u2013 is best known in the UK as the main ingredient in a caipirinha, if it&apos;s known at all. Cacha\u00e7a is the world&apos;s third most popular spirit after Korean soju and vodka, yet 99% of the estimated 1.6bn litres produced annually are consumed in Brazil. Until recently, only a few brands bothered to export, sending most to one country \u2013 Germany. Although the caipirinha is a wonderful drink, another Brazilian classic is more versatile. The batida, a combination of cacha\u00e7a, fresh fruit or juice, ice and sugar to taste, is easy to replicate. It may be hard to source cashew-apple juice in Britain, but it is possible to find a\u00e7ai, coconut milk, passion fruit and fresh citrus, which are the usual alternatives. Blackcurrant, blackberry and strawberry are also delicious. Batida Morangocacha\u00e7a 40ml (try organic Abelha cacha\u00e7a)ripe strawberries 5sugar \u00bd tspice cubes 1 cup Combine ingredients in a blender. Blend well. Serve in a wine glass.

Jared Brown 12 Polpetto      Florence Knight, Head Chef at Polpetto in Soho, London. Photograph: Suki Dhanda for Observer Food Monthly    Polpetto is a new Soho institution. Its low-key, high-quality Italian cooking made a star of head chef and local girl Florence Knight when it opened above the French House pub on Dean Street, and the critical acclaim has continued since its move in February to a chic, slender room at the grotty end of Berwick Street. Standout dishes include a hefty bacon chop and a clever spin on caesar salad using cavolo nero, anchovies and burnt bread. One of three relatively recent openings on, or just off, the same street, it&apos;s joined Ember Yard (tapas, from the Salt Yard group) and Blanchette (bistro) in what&apos;s becoming Soho&apos;s restaurant alley. Alan Yau&apos;s &quot;Chinese gastropub&quot; Duck &amp; Rice is also on its way. Yau was here first, of course, with plush dim sum restaurant Yauatcha (still open, sold a while ago, though he&apos;s thought to retain a minority stake). Among the area&apos;s other early adopters: Copita&apos;s slick tapas, Bone Daddies&apos; brilliant ramen and Flat White, one of London&apos;s first up-to-date coffee shops. Berwick Street is now the faultline between Soho&apos;s romantic past and glossy future, especially at the Polpetto end, close to what&apos;s left of the sex shops on Walker&apos;s Court, which may soon be redeveloped. Diners seeking the shabby glamour of old may have to be content with the smart way Yau&apos;s been hiding the building work for Duck &amp; Rice: blowups of nostalgic old photos, with pride of place going to Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, buying fruit on Berwick Street in 1976. polpo.co.uk Gareth Grundy 13 Vermouth  No longer merely the aromatising seasoning for a classic martini, vermouth is having a moment. It&apos;s a particularly big deal in Barcelona, where Albert (brother of Ferran) Adri\u00e0&apos;s\u00a0Bodega 1900 is one of many new-wave vermuter\u00edas. But the trend for small-batch vermouth is also apparent in London restaurants and bars such as Opium in Soho and 69 Colebrooke Row, with the latter&apos;s Tony Conigliaro crafting his own. Try it at home with Italian classic Punt e Mes or high-class Piemontese small producer Vergano, sold by Tutto\u00a0Wines. tuttowines.com David Williams 14 The Lockhart Before he moved to London, The Lockhart&apos;s Brad McDonald was executive chef at the highly rated Governor in Brooklyn. Then Hurricane Sandy intervened. &quot;When we left, the night of the storm, there was about 18\u00a0inches of water in the restaurant,&quot; says McDonald. &quot;We thought we&apos;d just have to rip up the floor. The next day, it was like the hurricane had gone through the building \u2013 the water was four feet deep.&quot; Having decided not to reopen, McDonald instead moved to London, cooking first at La Bodega Negra in Soho but making his mark as head chef at The Lockhart in Marylebone. His food draws on the southern American cuisine of his Mississippi childhood; simple dishes \u2013 cornbread, gumbo, shrimp and grits \u2013 cooked with the flair and intense flavours you&apos;d expect of someone who trained at Noma, Per Se and Alain Ducasse at Essex House. &quot;It&apos;s a heritage project,&quot; he says. &quot;Being in London has given me the opportunity to look back and reflect. But it&apos;s not completely emotional: there&apos;s a gap here between what&apos;s offered as southern fare, and what I\u00a0know to be southern food.&quot; It&apos;s a region that&apos;s increasingly influential in Europe. Not for nothing\u00a0did the inaugural US leg of Cook It Raw \u2013 the roadshow\u00a0featuring some of the world&apos;s best chefs \u2013 take place in Charleston, South Carolina, last October. And the truth is, we&apos;re still catching up. &quot;It&apos;s the birthplace of American cuisine,&quot; says McDonald. &quot;Many of the true southern food ways resonate with European chefs \u2013 cooking locally, cooking from nose to\u00a0tail, cooking seasonally. Also,\u00a0it&apos;s totally charming.&quot; lockhartlondon.com GG 15 Sandor Katz     Sandor Katz shot at his new Foundation for Fermentaion in Tennessee. Photograph: Benjy Russell for Observer Food Monthly    &quot;Most people aren&apos;t thinking about fermentation,&quot; says Sandor Katz, &quot;but everybody is eating products of fermentation every day.&quot; He mentions yoghurt, cheese and sourdough bread; we talk about beer, wine, salami, chocolate and coffee. Katz has lived for many years in an off-grid commune in rural Tennessee, churning out sauerkraut and brewing obscure variants of kombucha tea for a small band of devotees. He spreads the gospel by writing successful books and running workshops around the world (he&apos;ll be appearing in London and Devon in May). My first Katz-inspired attempt at fermentation is sauerkraut \u2013 the best place to start, he says. I chop carrot, onions, beetroot, cabbage and mix them in a bowl with salt and caraway seeds. I squeeze them by hand till they are dripping with juice, then cram the colourful mixture into a Kilner jar. A week later, the mixture is punchy, complex, flavourful \u2013 delicious. wildfermentation.com KF 16 64 Degrees, Brighton Chef and owner Michael Bremner has given the Brighton food scene a bit of a shakeup. There are no courses, there&apos;s no structure, order what you want and eat it as it comes (in my case, virtually the whole menu). His adherence to the further fringes of kitchen kit is hinted at in the restaurant&apos;s name: 64C is the temperature at which the &quot;house egg&quot; is cooked until its texture is as silky as the finest praline. When I reviewed 64 Degrees I said to local indignation that, foodwise, it was possibly the most exciting thing to happen to Brighton ever. I&apos;m more than happy to stand by what I said. 64degrees.co.uk Marina\u00a0O&apos;Loughlin 17 Wine: the next generation     Michael and Charlotte Sager-Wilde.

Originally it was picked because the cafe&apos;s cooking facilities were so basic, but now regulars won&apos;t let them take it off. &quot;There will be times when the cheese hasn&apos;t turned up and people can be quite unpleasant about it,&quot; says Laura Jackson, the head chef. &quot;But as much as it&apos;s the bane of my life, it&apos;s a very versatile and delicious thing.&quot; The secret is to use the best ingredients you can find: Towpath opts for Montgomery cheddar from Neal&apos;s Yard Dairy.

So you&apos;ll find Europe&apos;s highest outdoor terraces at Sushisamba on the 38th floor of the Heron Tower, looking down on the suddenly puny Gherkin, while evening tables at any of the Shard&apos;s trio of restaurants \u2013 Hutong, Oblix and Aqua Shard \u2013 offer a widescreen view of the capital that&apos;s pure cinema. In May the Shangri-La hotel&apos;s Ting will open on the 35th level of the Shard, with its bar, Gong, on the 52nd floor. Do these places offer the best views of the capital? Maybe. They&apos;re certainly the most spectacular, with elevated old favourites such as the Oxo Tower, Galvin at Windows and Coq d&apos;Argent quaint relics from another era, when height wasn&apos;t everything. GG 20 If you can&apos;t get a table at Noma Noma may be a small restaurant for which it&apos;s nigh on impossible to get a booking, but it has transformed Copenhagen into one of the world&apos;s top food destinations, populated by chefs who acquired their skills and confidence in Ren\u00e9 Redzepi&apos;s groundbreaking kitchen. Rel\u00e6, opened in 2011 by Italian-Norwegian Christian Puglisi, was the first to suggest Noma might produce equally adventurous alumni, followed last summer by Bror, whose chefs Samuel Nutter and Victor W\u00e5gman have won rave reviews for their challenging dishes (one favourite is deep-fried bull&apos;s testicles). &quot;Copenhagen was the only place I could call home,&quot; says Matt Orlando, whose highly rated Amass is in the city&apos;s old shipbuilding quarter. &quot;I stayed because the produce is among the best in the world. The chefs don&apos;t adhere to what they think the public wants, and none of us thinks of each other as competition.&quot; MB 21 Lunch at Hibiscus  When it comes to restaurants of ambition, lunch has always been where\u00a0the bargains hide. Nowhere is\u00a0this more true than with the brilliantly poised neoclassicism of chef\u00a0Claude Bosi&apos;s cooking at Hibiscus\u00a0in Mayfair. The full menu costs \u00a387.50 for three courses before you hit the wine list. At lunch, however, \u00a335 gets you three courses from a menu that includes the likes of a warm pike quenelle, Scottish bavette with barbecued onions, profiteroles, coffee sorbet and whisky cr\u00e8me anglaise. Go\u00a0to\u00a0\u00a349 and they&apos;ll throw in half a bottle of wine, coffee and petits fours. Cheap? Of course not. But good value?

He sends me seeds of the Basque &quot;tear&quot; peas (tiny, sweet, exquisite) and tomatoes (ditto) he serves at his astonishing restaurant (meals start with a garden tasting). Although Atxa&apos;s tastes were influenced by his grandmother and mother, his cooking was schooled in Japan and by top kitchens in his beloved Basque country (a stellar CV includes Etxebarri and Mugaritz).

Expect cheffy twists on current trends: starters include fried\u00a0chicken and doughnuts (slider\u2011sized and stuffed with crab), but\u00a0it is in the grilling and smoking that the skill shines through, particularly on a monkfish dish and a perfectly marbled Iberico pork.

According to the owners of this tiny Syrian pastry shop, you won&apos;t find booza al-haleb \u2013 Arabic ice-cream rolled in chopped pistachios \u2013 anywhere else in Europe. (The most famous booza parlour is Bakdash in Damascus, still operating in spite of the war.) At Damas Rose, they make it fresh every day, with milk, salep powder and mastic gum, for elasticity. Whereas ice-cream is usually whipped up to let air in, booza has all the air pounded out, hence the density and slow melt. The flavour is subtle but more-ish. 121b Edgware Road, London W2. 020\u00a07180 1972 KF 33 Cocoa Runners  It arrives in a slim cardboard package.

Photograph: Per-Anders Jorgensen    Petter Nilsson is one of Sweden&apos;s best chefs but first established himself in Paris, as part of a talented group of young cooks who helped make the city an exciting place to eat again. Now he&apos;s bringing his precise vegetable-driven cooking to Stockholm, although it has taken a while. Five years ago he began spending more time back in Sweden where his wife-to-be, Anna, still lived. Running his restaurant, La Gazzetta, and the contrast between the two cities \u2013 hectic workdays in Paris; the calm of just hanging out in Stockholm \u2013 made him rethink. There was also an opportunity to make his mark in his homeland. &quot;One thing I really missed in Stockholm,&quot; he says, &quot;when I started to spend time here again, was a good place to eat lunch. Somewhere you could go for one main course but end up having three, and a glass of wine. Places that make you want to put off work to spend a whole afternoon in them.&quot; So when the offer came to take\u00a0over the restaurant at Stockholm&apos;s\u00a0waterfront Spritmuseum the decision was easy.

Here, in his first production for London&apos;s Young Vic, Van Hove turns his talent for reappraisal to Arthur Miller&apos;s claustrophobic 1955 tale of a Brooklyn longshoreman, Eddie Carbone, and his obsession with his niece, Catherine. The effect is startling. The most daring decision taken by Van Hove and his designer, Jan Versweyveld, is to dispense with Miller&apos;s precise stage directions (this was a playwright whose notes to his actors and directors were often as poignant and exacting as his dialogue). The production opens not on a Red Hook tenement, but with a stark black box that lifts to reveal a bare thrust stage, bordered by a low Perspex wall. This is the cage in which the inevitable tragedy \u2013 Miller himself described his play, inspired by a true story, as a &quot;Greek drama&quot; \u2013 will be played out. A boxing ring, even, in which two men must collide \u2013 as they do in one of the play&apos;s most powerful scenes, when Carbone (Mark Strong) challenges his rival, his wife&apos;s young cousin Rodolpho (Luke Norris), to a play-fight that quickly turns nasty. Strong is outstanding as Carbone: deadened, defeated, thrumming with barely restrained aggression. &quot;His eyes were like tunnels,&quot; the lawyer Alfieri (Michael Gould) says of Carbone - here, you believe it. And he is matched by an excellent cast - especially Nicola Walker as Carbone&apos;s frustrated wife, Beatrice; and Phoebe Fox as a brilliantly playful, naturalistic Catherine. The power of the production lies in emphasising the play&apos;s universal qualities. Much is gained, but something is also lost. We have no sense of Brooklyn, or of the dockworkers&apos; hardscrabble existence; and the period detail \u2013 records, stenography, Greta Garbo \u2013 sits a little uneasily against this new timeless setting. Tom Gibbons&apos;s sound, too \u2013 a wash of dramatic choral sequences, underpinned by a terrible pulse, like a ticking clock \u2013 ratchets up the tension, but sometimes risks overwhelming a story that is quite tense enough already. But this remains a visceral, vital reinterpretation of a classic play, full of persuasive visual imagery that displays the singular sensibility of Van Hove and his team, and is bound to linger long in the memory. \u2022 Monroe and Miller&apos;s sensational year \u2013 in pictures\u2022 Ivo van Hove: &apos;My aim is the ultimate production&apos;\u2022 Mark Strong: &apos;It&apos;s going to be stark and bare and brutal&apos;", "sentences": ["The Belgian director Ivo van Hove has made his name with bold, experimental stage adaptations of films by major European auteurs - Bergman, Antonioni, Visconti - produced with his Amsterdam-based company, Toneelgroep."], "title": "A View from the Bridge review \u2013 'visceral and vital'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/13/view-from-the-bridge-young-vic-review-mark-strong", "tags": ["Theatre", "Arthur Miller", "Culture", "Stage", "Ivo van Hove"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-12T23:05:33Z", "article": "Dear Boris Let&apos;s agree that towers can be beautiful. Let&apos;s also agree that London needs new homes and plenty of them. It may well be that many of the 200-plus tall buildings now proposed can play a useful role if, as you say, they are &quot;sensitively managed, well designed and in the right place&quot;. London is not Amsterdam nor Vienna, cities whose inherited profile is retained at all costs. But neither, as you once put it, should it be Dubai-on-Thames. Can you look at Strata SE1, the proposed One Nine Elms, or the polychrome blisters of Stratford, and say that they earn their place on the London stage? Or that the chaos of pricks at Vauxhall will be a well-formed piece of city of which we can be proud? Or that the proposed clusters at Vauxhall and Waterloo do not affect the settings of the Houses of Parliament and other historic places? Unesco thinks they do. Have you seen the effect of the Walkie-Talkie on views of the Tower and Tower Bridge from south of the river? Do you honestly think that a studio flat in the One Blackfriars development, with a starting price of \u00a31,015,000, is the best answer to London&apos;s housing needs? Between the 20th floor and the top of the proposed 49-storey Ludgate House, also in Blackfriars, 65 flats will be created. Does this small dent in your annual target of 49,000 justify the extra floors, which will dominate the river bank for centuries? As you say, some affordable housing is paid for by building towers, through the mechanism of planning gain. But it is not the only way to get this gain: developments that are lower and/or better designed could also deliver it. Is there any evidence that towers are the best way to achieve it? Before embarking on this radical transformation of the city, did anyone do the maths? When I ask your spokesman if you have any evidence on the numbers being created by tall buildings, I get the answer: &quot;We don&apos;t.&quot; I am in general concerned about your command of data. You trumpet that &quot;in a recent survey, the Gherkin was Londoners&apos; favourite building, followed by the Shard and then the Cheesegrater&quot;. That would be the Ipsos Mori poll in which people were asked to choose the best from a list of 13 towers. That the first three were all tall is therefore no more revelatory than that the Grand National was won by a horse. You also say that the new skyscrapers are the result of policies that have been publicly aired. But no Londoners, not even the mayor, have been shown the cumulative effects of these policies. The images that the Observer published on 30 March are more extensive than any seen before, but even they only show parts of the city. Many who saw them were amazed \u2013 they had no idea that anything like this is happening. Policy has been made blind and much of the consultation has been in name only. At times, you sound like a minister of the Harold Wilson era, preaching megastructures in the name of Progress and the People. The People, as tested by other questions in that Ipsos Mori survey, were split on the question whether more tall buildings should be built. But clear majorities said they wouldn&apos;t want to live in them and thought that siting and design were important. Before we further inflict the White Heat of Phallocracy, should we not be certain that we are meeting these wishes? If London is, as you like to say, the Greatest City in the World, it also deserves the greatest planning, not default solutions downloaded from other places.

The mood was sombre, since no one could quite yet accept his departure. The Italian conductor died in January at the age of 80. Having conducted the annual festival for 11 consecutive seasons, Abbado was indelibly associated with this Swiss city, a magnet for musicians over the centuries. As the audience settled into their seats, so the Lucerne Festival Orchestra assembled on stage quietly, men wearing dark ties, women in concert black. Each player tuned with particular care, as if delaying the moment when formally, through music, they would bid their revered maestro (his least favourite word) farewell. Handpicked by Abbado from ensembles across Europe, they had become his friends, as well as close colleagues of one another.      Many had been with him since he set up the orchestra in 2003, after his recovery from stomach cancer. Each summer these star players would gather in Lucerne for three intensive weeks. They could have gone to the beach. Instead they chose to work harder than ever. Abbado asked nothing more of his musicians than that they listen to each other, the simplest yet the hardest demand. Last week, all had travelled from far and wide, interrupting busy concert schedules to be there. As silence fell \u2013 the point at which the conductor would normally make his way on to the platform \u2013 nothing happened. The podium remained empty. Then a ghostly, low rumble sounded from cellos and double basses, so quiet you had to strain to hear. With an enormous upward gesture of his right arm, the orchestra&apos;s leader \u2013 Sebastian Breuninger, a concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus \u2013 lifted his bow to usher in strings and woodwind. The spectral opening of Schubert&apos;s Unfinished Symphony had begun. It was a poignant choice. Abbado conducted this work in the closing event of the 2013 Lucerne festival (and on two previous evenings; a recording of the first is on YouTube), together with Bruckner&apos;s Ninth, also unfinished. No one knew it would be his last concert. There were no words of adieu \u2013 a self-effacing man, he would never have sought that kind of limelight \u2013 and programmes were in place for this year&apos;s season, naming him as conductor. Frail though he was, he had survived many skirmishes with death.            In that performance, Abbado had taken the Schubert at an unusually slow pace. No one needed to speak the words &quot;intimations of mortality&quot;. Now the Lucerne players, without their pilot but sure of their course, preferred a brisker approach. The silken perfection of the strings took on a fervent, translucent quality. As the music swelled, so the ensemble moved as one. At the end no one clapped. No one moved. Several players wiped away tears. With wise planning, words came next; music would have been impossible. The actor Bruno Ganz, a close friend of Abbado&apos;s, read from H\u00f6lderlin, one of his favourite poets, whose work has inspired composers including Brahms and Schumann, Heinz Holliger and Luigi Nono. In the late elegy Brot und Wein, Christian symbolism is interwoven with Greek mythology, exploring the nature of belief and asking whether the gods who have departed will ever return.     The actor Bruno Ganz reading from H\u00f6lderlin. Photograph: \u00a9 Georg Anderhub/ Lucerne Festival    At this point, perhaps with some relief for the visibly affected audience, the concert turned back to the present. The young Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons \u2013 anointed but not yet confirmed as Abbado&apos;s successor in Lucerne \u2013 was there to conduct the remainder. How he must have felt, walking on to fill that hitherto blank space on the podium one can only guess. Abbado \u2013 together with Mariss Jansons, another Lucerne regular \u2013 was one of Nelsons&apos;s mentors, but he is an imitator of neither. His gestures are bigger and more dramatic, his engagement with the orchestra more chatty and jokey, but still wholly serious. (There was a certain concord, for those few of us who happened to attend both events, in the fact that the night before, Jansons had conducted his Amsterdam Concertgebouw at the Barbican, London in the last piece Abbado ever conducted: Bruckner&apos;s Ninth.) At least Nelsons had the moral support of the German violinist Isabelle Faust, soloist in Berg&apos;s Violin Concerto which she recorded with Abbado in 2011. Always an elegiac work, it was dedicated to &quot;the memory of an angel&quot; \u2013 Manon Gropius, the daughter of Alma Mahler and the Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius, who died of polio aged 18. Faust plays with steely virtuosity, intelligence and poetry. She can make a pianissimo trill last seemingly for ever. Never flamboyant, keenly uncompromising, she was a favourite performer of Abbado&apos;s and little wonder. One of the concerto&apos;s hallmarks is its ghostly opaqueness. Snatches of 12-tone melody dart like shadows, until the moment when a Bach choral, Es ist genug, rises out of Berg&apos;s dense underworld, a moment of tonal release.     Isabelle Faust playing Berg\u2019s Violin Concerto at the memorial concert, conducted by Andris Nelsons. Photograph: \u00a9 Georg Anderhub/Lucerne Festival    Abbado had no boundaries to his musical passions, but his interpretations of Mahler were a high point of his Lucerne performances. The programme ended with the finale of Mahler&apos;s Symphony No 3. The instructions on the score read: &quot;Slowly, tranquil, deeply felt&quot;. It opens with the sweetest possible pianissimo string melody, gradually swelling to an anguished fortissimo that is eventually transfigured into grief-filled acceptance. As the climax approached, all eyes were on the percussionist \u2013 Dirk Wucherpfennig of the Konzerthausorchester, Berlin. His task was to raise a pair of vast clash cymbals, locking his hands into the support straps and positioning them ready for the critical moment. A split second too soon or too late, an imperfect crash of the two plates and the entire effect would have been ruined. For what seemed like minutes, he held each cymbal close to his body, flexing his arms in readiness. Spot on time, the noisy roar erupted exactly as Mahler had written. The player held the cymbals, gleaming and spectacular,\u00a0up aloft until after the resonance had ceased. By chance, Wucherpfennig was on the same train as me, rushing back to the airport together with half the orchestra. He admitted it was a terrifying moment, perhaps the most alarming in his career. Was he trying to make a metaphor with that massive, long-held gesture? Yes, he said, that was exactly what he was trying to do. If he had in any sense succeeded, it was worth the nerves, the angst, the arm-ache, the pressure and the emotion of the occasion. He achieved his aim. In his absence, Claudio Abbado could not have felt more present.", "sentences": ["(There was a certain concord, for those few of us who happened to attend both events, in the fact that the night before, Jansons had conducted his Amsterdam Concertgebouw at the Barbican, London in the last piece Abbado ever conducted: Bruckner&apos;s Ninth.)"], "title": "Claudio Abbado memorial concert review \u2013 'in his absence he could not have felt more present'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/13/claudio-abbado-memorial-concert-review-lucerne-festival-orchestra", "tags": ["Claudio Abbado", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Andris Nelsons"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-13T14:27:15Z", "article": "Looking back, it was easy to see that the crash was coming. There had been too much cheap money. Debt had exploded. Speculation was rife. The gap between rich and poor had widened. Welfare spending had risen. The financial system was so stretched that even a modest tightening of policy was enough to make it impossible for over-borrowed debtors to service their debts. The US in 2007? No, this was imperial Rome during the reign of Tiberius in AD33. It was not the first documented financial crisis; that dubious accolade goes to the states of the Delian League in ancient Greece, which defaulted on their debts following a naval blockade by Sparta. But a time traveller would see remarkable similarities between the unfolding of the Roman crisis of almost two millennia ago and the 2007-09 crash. The calling in of loans led to a credit crunch. Debtors went to the wall. Prices fell. The emperor arranged for the most heavily indebted to get interest-free loans for three years. A &quot;bad bank&quot; was set up. Tiberius financed his own version of quantitative easing, not by selling imperial bonds but by confiscating wealthy Romans&apos; assets. All of this is documented in an excellent new book by Bob Swarup called Money Mania*, which looks at booms, panics and busts down the ages. His message is that nothing is really new. Put together people, credit and structural fragility and you create the perfect conditions for a crisis. Swarup&apos;s book comes out at an opportune moment. The past week has seen a shudder pass through stock markets as investors have taken a closer look at some of the more highly valued technology stocks. Easter traditionally marks the start of the British house-buying season, and this year&apos;s begins with sales at a six-year high and prices up almost 10% on a year ago. The appetite for risk was highlighted by the demand for the five-year bonds issued by the Greek government. Inevitably, the talk is of bubbles about to pop, of a new speculative mania, of lessons not learnt. This talk is a bit premature but the warning signs are there. History suggests that certain conditions have to be in place for a crisis to develop. The first is that a decent period of time has to elapse after the previous crash. When bubbles burst, a cavalier approach to risk is replaced, almost instantaneously, by risk aversion. It takes time for those burned by their losses to forget. In the UK, for example, there was a property boom in the early 1970s, another in the late 1980s and a third in the early to mid 2000s. A 15-year gap is the norm. The second condition is a sustained period of solid growth, by the end of which individuals convince themselves that the good times will go on and on. Accordingly, the property boom of the early 1970s came after 25 years of strong growth; the overheated market in the late 1980s stemmed from a belief that Thatcher&apos;s reforms had eradicated all the economy&apos;s problems; that in the 2000s came amid a period of uninterrupted growth lasting more than 60 quarters. A third crucial factor is belief in those running the show. The runup to the Great Recession of 2007-09 was the heyday of independent central banks, which preened themselves on their ability to deliver solid non-inflationary growth. There were a few, such as Bill White at the Bank for International Settlements, who warned that bubbles could develop in low-inflationary periods, but they were ignored. The public assumed that central banks were fully in control \u2013 a misplaced confidence as it turned out. Central banks, no matter how clever, cannot prevent crises. The establishment of the independent Bank of Amsterdam in 1609 did not prevent the tulip mania of the 1630s; the founding of the Bank of England in 1694 was followed a quarter of a century later by the South Sea Bubble. The Wall Street Crash occurred 16 years after the creation of the Federal Reserve. Whip these three ingredients together and you have the recipe for a crisis. As Swarup notes, humans don&apos;t like to stand still. &quot;Growth is a strong psychological impetus, and if we are not growing in our lives in some way, we feel trapped and miserable.&quot; So a recent period of growth plus confidence in policymakers allows us to extrapolate the past into the future, even if that means ignoring inconvenient facts. But more is needed to create the perfect bubble dish. Crises do not occur unless there is an abundance of credit to allow debt to build up and to permit speculators to take ever bigger bets. When economies become saturated with debt, as they were in the mid-2000s, it is time to prepare for the worst. That is certainly the case if complex financial systems are badly flawed. Nobody really understood what the web of banks, hedge funds and shadow banks were up to as they traded credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations. Regulators certainly didn&apos;t. These two final ingredients matter. In the absence of credit and a functioning framework, economies grow only very slowly, as they did in the 1,000 years after the Roman empire collapsed. But too much debt plus poorly managed and regulated financial systems will, sooner or later, lead to trouble. The fact that we are still bubble conscious suggests that the right conditions for a bubble do not yet exist. Insufficient time has passed. Investors are able to differentiate between tech companies that are not making profits and firms in the real economy that do have a track record of earnings growth. In the UK as a whole, house prices have yet to return to their pre-crisis peak, although they have already done so in London. Regulation is still being tightened as policymakers seek to avoid the mistakes of the past. The eurozone is only just emerging from a triple-dip recession and Britain&apos;s national output is still lower than it was six years ago. A much longer period of expansion will, on past form, be necessary for the onset of amnesia. All that said, there are a couple of reasons to beware. One is that central banks could leave policy too loose for too long. Dario Perkins, of Lombard Street Research, is one analyst cautioning that if the Fed leaves policy as loose as forecasts suggest, it could create new asset bubbles. The other is that in the age of Facebook and Twitter, only &quot;now&quot; matters. If we have lost our capacity to remember, trouble may come sooner than we think. *Money Mania: Bob Swarup; Bloomsbury", "sentences": ["The establishment of the independent Bank of Amsterdam in 1609 did not prevent the tulip mania of the 1630s; the founding of the Bank of England in 1694 was followed a quarter of a century later by the South Sea Bubble."], "title": "Banks fiddled while Rome burned: how to predict the next global financial crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/13/banks-rome-financial-crisis", "tags": ["Economics", "Business", "Economic recovery", "Housing market", "Bank of England", "Federal Reserve", "Financial crisis", "Financial sector", "Banking", "Banking reform", "Credit crunch", "Recession", "Global recession", "History", "Books"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-14T11:59:17Z", "article": "Ian McEwan will focus on the contested domains of religion and family life for his forthcoming novel, The Children Act, according to his publisher Jonathan Cape. Due to be published on 4 September 2014, The Children Act puts ideas of adult responsibility on trial with a plot that revolves around parents who are refusing treatment for their sick son because of their religious beliefs. The novel centres on the presiding judge at the high court, who is a woman. Speaking at last month&apos;s Oxford literary festival, McEwan described the denial of medical help on religious grounds &quot;utterly perverse and inhumane&quot;, according to the Telegraph, arguing that &quot;the secular mind seems far superior in making reasonable judgments&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s an almost consumerist notion that the pursuit of individual happiness cuts across the interests of children,&quot; McEwan said. Citing cases involving Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses and Catholics, McEwan praised the 1989 Children&apos;s Act, which enshrines the child&apos;s welfare as the &quot;paramount consideration&quot; in any court ruling, calling it a &quot;remarkable and civilised piece of legislation&quot;. The novelist has long been suspicious of organised faith, telling the Believer in 2005 that he has &quot;no patience whatsoever&quot; with religion. &quot;I&apos;m not against religion in the sense that I feel I can&apos;t tolerate it,&quot; he said, &quot;but I think written into the rubric of religion is the certainty of its own truth. And since there are 6,000 religions currently on the face of the Earth, they can&apos;t all be right. And only the secular spirit can guarantee those freedoms, and it&apos;s the secular spirit that they contest.&quot; According to McEwan&apos;s publisher, Dan Franklin, the new novel is &quot;classic McEwan, demonstrating yet again his extraordinary ability to speak to both head and heart.&quot; The novelist launched a career which has combined critical acclaim and bestselling success in 1975, with a collection of short stories which touched on child sexual abuse, First Love, Last Rites. The Cement Garden was published in 1978, the story of a brother and sister who bury their mother in the cellar and leave civilisation behind.

Mike Summerbee, who sometimes shared a room with Moore on England trips, said he was &quot;the only man who could have a bath and get out dry&quot;. Moore would flick the water off one leg, dry that with a towel and then step out on to the dry leg, before continuing the process with the rest of his body. Moore&apos;s routine will come as no surprise to those who watched his immaculate, pristine defending. Nor will the fact that he brought such meticulousness to his wardrobe, where jumpers were hung up in order from dark to light. &quot;It was,&quot; says his first wife Tina in Bobby Moore: By The Person Who Knew Him Best, &quot;almost an aesthetic pleasure to open the wardrobe.&quot; The fastidiousness demonstrated by Moore is one of the sub-genres of perfectionism within football. There&apos;s also the impossible, self-torturing expectations of perfectionist-winners such as Soren Lerby and Roy Keane, whose business face should be the subject of a modernist painting entitled simply: &apos;Standards&apos;. Other significant manifestations include the perfection-making practice of forces of nurture like Peter Shilton or Cristiano Ronaldo, Spain&apos;s obsessive-compulsive tiki-taka and Pep Guardiola&apos;s need for control, and the artistic leanings of players like Eric Cantona and Dimitar Berbatov. If you put all those types of perfectionism on a Venn diagram, the man in the middle might be Dennis Bergkamp, the perfectionist&apos;s perfectionist. Thierry Henry said he loved &quot;Every. Single. Thing&quot; about Bergkamp, but the thing he loved the most was the way Bergkamp trained, because &quot;everything had to be perfect&quot;. Bergkamp also had unrealistic expectations \u2013 of himself, if not necessarily others - and was a sucker for cleanliness. The Guardian&apos;s Amy Lawrence noticed how starched his socks were during an interview 10 years ago, a revelation that would not surprise Patrick Vieira. &quot;To make his kind of passes you have to like things to be perfect,&quot; says Vieira in Stillness and Speed. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if his clothes are really well organised. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised at all.&quot; Finally there is perfection as aesthetic idealism, the thing with which Bergkamp is most associated and which informed so much of what he did on a football field. Bergkamp&apos;s imagination was his gift and his curse. It elevated him above his peers, but it is also meant he was in danger of driving himself round the bend aiming for something that he could not explain and which might not even exist; he was almost striving for Godot. The life of a perfectionist is not easy. Or so we&apos;d imagine. Most people are casual perfectionists at best, and confuse perfectionism with self-loathing, yet it&apos;s comforting to indulge that vague notion because the reality \u2013 that adulthood is what happens while you&apos;re busy making compromises on your youthful ideals \u2013 is too dispiriting to acknowledge. Yet every now and then you come across someone for whom perfectionism is a way of life, who has no choice but to embrace an existence in which anything less than the best is a felony.     Holland fans celebrate with a cut-out figure of Bergkamp. Photograph: Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images    Perfection is a recurring theme of Stillness and Speed, Bergkamp&apos;s excellent book. One chapter is called &apos;It Has To Be Perfect&apos;, which is both his mantra and an indication that his co-author David Winner wasn&apos;t a Fairground Attraction fan. &quot;Well, you set yourself goals, targets,&quot; he says in this extract from the book. &quot;And once you&apos;ve got there you want to move on and go further. You keep raising the bar and therefore it&apos;s never good enough. You want perfection. It&apos;s never good enough but it&apos;s within your reach. You climb one mountain and see the higher one.&quot; On 4 July 1998, Bergkamp climbed the highest mountain for 2.11 seconds \u2013 the time it took for him to produce the three divine touches and score the penultimate-minute winner against Argentina that put Holland into the World Cup semi-final. &quot;Perfect&quot; was Ruud Gullit&apos;s description on ITV that night. &quot;You never play the perfect game,&quot; said Bergkamp later, &quot;but the moment itself was, I think, perfect.&quot; Both stalled over the P-word, as if they would be sent straight to hell for sacrilege should they misuse it, before realising that, actually, yes, that was the only way to describe it. Given Dutch football&apos;s obsession with creative purity, you know something special has happened when a Dutch footballer describes something as perfect. In One Moment In Time, her rhapsodic treatment of spiritual fulfilment, Whitney Houston beseeched: &quot;Give me one moment in time, when I&apos;m more than I thought I could be.&quot; For Bergkamp, this was it. &quot;You&apos;re in that moment,&quot; said Bergkamp. &quot;That&apos;s the feeling. After the first two touches \u2026 that moment! You give absolutely everything. It&apos;s like your life has led up to this moment.&quot; The reprieve One man never gets the thanks he deserves for his part in Bergkamp&apos;s goal. Not Frank de Boer \u2013 whose creation of the goal is regularly acknowledged \u2013 but Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda-Aranda. He was the Spanish referee who inexplicably declined to send Bergkamp off for stamping on Sinisa Mihajlovic during Holland&apos;s 2-1 win over Yugoslavia in the second round five days earlier. Bergkamp misplaced the plot, as was his occasional wont, and should have walked. &quot;I haven&apos;t the faintest idea why I did that,&quot; he says. &quot;I was startled by my own behaviour.&quot; He was not alone in that. On the morning of the game, most papers focused not on the prospect of an immense quarter-final but on Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s criticism of Bergkamp, who had been the Player of the Year in Arsenal&apos;s domestic double that season. It may have been on Bergkamp&apos;s mind, because he was quiet for large parts of the game. Indeed apart from producing one of the World Cup&apos;s greatest goals and one of the most imaginative assists, he did the square root of bugger all.           Bergkamp argues that he did two great things that day, and he&apos;ll be thrilled to know that we agree with him. The first came in the 12th minute, an ingenious falling header to create the opening goal for Patrick Kluivert. The more you watch it, the better it gets. Bergkamp almost invents a new type of pass, the square through ball. He was always as much an architect and geometrician as he was a footballer \u2013 as a child he was obsessed with geometry \u2013 and was forever highlighting that a football pitch was so much bigger than it seemed as 20 men were magnetised towards the ball. Bergkamp could find acres of space and strip a defence naked with one pass, as shown in Jeroen Henneman&apos;s diagram (&quot;One moment the pitch is crowded and narrow. Suddenly it is huge and wide \u2026 A miracle&quot;) in Winner&apos;s book Brilliant Orange. In football it&apos;s often said that the run makes the pass. With Bergkamp, the pass regularly made the run \u2013 either by ushering a player like Nicolas Anelka into a certain area, or because those like Anelka and Kluivert know from experience what Bergkamp would explore. In this case, forewarned was dangerously forearmed. Bergkamp was among that small, counter-instinctive group of players who seemed to get as much joy from an assist as from a goal. Thus in many ways this pass to Kluivert, rather than the goal, was truly representative of his career: the awareness and creation of space, the quick wit and, of course, the gentle touch. In a split-second, he worked out all the angles \u2013 in both senses \u2013 and utilised an extra-sensory perception in a way that evokes those breathless, deductive visual analyses so beloved of Benedict Cumberbatch&apos;s Sherlock Holmes every time he meets a stranger or finds a dead body. Ronald de Boer&apos;s pass is flat and hard and waist high too high to control with my foot and too low for my chest so I have to fall to my left and squash my body so that I can cushion it with my head but where do I cushion it out of the corner of my eye I see Kluivert making a run off Chamot if I head it towards him between Sensini and Chamot the control will be too difficult at high speed besides there isn&apos;t much space there the space is between Sensini who has come towards me and Ayala who has gone out to meet de Boer so I need to play almost a square pass with my head the other side of Sensini into the angle of Kluivert&apos;s run I can&apos;t cushion it as gently with my head as with my foot but that&apos;s fine because the space is fairly big and if I head it too softly Roa will stay on his line and stay big so it&apos;s okay to put a fraction more on it to entice Roa from his line because if he comes out Kluivert has a much easier finish.     Bergkamp flicks the ball past Roa. Photograph: Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty Images    It&apos;s often said of more prosaic footballers that they are much better when they don&apos;t have time to think. Bergkamp was one of the most thoughtful footballers of all, yet the same rules applied to him. His greatest gift was his instinctive intelligence. When he had time to consider things he was often less effective \u2013 look at his penalty record for a start \u2013 and his best work was done when he had barely a split second to compute everything. When he was in that moment. &quot;It&apos;s like solving a puzzle,&quot; he said in FourFourTwo. &quot;I always had a picture in my head of how things would look two or three seconds later. I could calculate it. There&apos;s a tremendous pleasure in doing something that someone else couldn&apos;t see.&quot; The Dutch have always seen football through different eyes to the rest of the world. Yet for all the grandiose talk and pompous riddles of someone like Johan Cruyff, the way the Dutch play football has always been very simple and unpretentious. With the exception of that goal at Newcastle, not so much a blockbuster as a brainbuster, Bergkamp&apos;s work was always straightforward and accessible, which is not always the case with great footballers. Bergkamp was a reminder of the economy, minimalism and humility of most great sportsmen. He frequently played one-touch and there was scarcely any indulgence or attempt to show how clever he was. It&apos;s so much harder to make something complex look simple than the other way round. That was one of Bergkamp&apos;s greatest qualities. &quot;I don&apos;t like tricks,&quot; he says. &quot;My game is about first touch, control, passing. Art for art&apos;s sake isn&apos;t interesting.&quot; If Bergkamp was accessible to the layman, that doesn&apos;t mean those who played alongside him didn&apos;t find an extra layer to appreciate. Bergkamp was very much a players&apos; player, the subject of rare reverence from those he played against and particularly with. &quot;I honestly didn&apos;t think a professional player could be that good,&quot; said Paul Merson. Ian Wright said he was &quot;the greatest signing Arsenal will ever make&quot; and Henry, whose list of team-mates includes Zinedine Zidane and Lionel Messi, says Bergkamp was the greatest he played alongside. Moments like the Kluivert assist explain why he was so revered.     Bergkamp wheels away after scoring the winning goal. Photograph: Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images    After Holland took the lead Bergkamp began to drift out of the game. Claudio L\u00f3pez equalised for Argentina in the 17th minute, nutmegging Edwin van der Sar in a manner so cocky as to remind us why the one-on-one is football&apos;s greatest masculinity-waving contest. Thereafter the game flowed beautifully, and has a strong case for being the best match in a World Cup full of excellent contests. It was the kind of classy, open game you only get when two teams are formidably comfortable both in their own skin, and with the ball at their feet. It was also a match loaded with significance, the first competitive meeting between the sides since Argentina beat Holland in the 1978 World Cup final. That match was Bergkamp&apos;s first memory of football: he was eight years old, standing at his home at Amsterdam, watching with confused childish distress as Rob Rensenbrink hit the post in the last minute of normal time before Argentina went on to win in extra-time. Twenty years later, Wim Jonk and Ariel Ortega rattled the post in the first half. In the second, Gabriel Batistuta staged an impromptu test of the quality of the craftsmanship of the official Fifa World Cup goalframe, walloping the post from 15 yards. The match seemed to swing Argentina&apos;s way in the 76th minute, when Arthur Numan was sent off for a second yellow card. Holland moved tactics expert Philip Cocu to left back and, although Argentina inevitably dominated possession thereafter, Holland were not unduly stretched \u2013 until the 87th minute, when a sensory overload of action changed everything. Ortega, a strong contender for the player of the tournament at that stage, ran at Jaap Stam in the box and dived. The referee gave nothing \u2013 a brilliant decision that could easily have gone the other way, with the dive only really apparent in slow motion. As Van der Sar came to remonstrate, Ortega, bristling with the kind of righteousness that only the guilty can summon, rose from the floor to stick his head into the underside of Van der Sar&apos;s chin. What was going to be a yellow card for diving morphed into a red, and both sides had a couple of minutes to consider the changing circumstances before entering a 10-a-side golden goal period. It didn&apos;t get that far. Fifty-three seconds after play restarted, Bergkamp produced his masterpiece. The quality of the goal is what is most spoken about now, but at the time the savageness of the swing was the most significant aspect of the overwhelming joy it created among the Dutch fans. One moment Holland had been hanging on with 10 men; the next they were 2-1 up and in the semi-final. Bergkamp said it was like his life had been leading up to this moment. The game certainly hadn&apos;t. For much of the second half, and particularly in the buildup to the goal, Bergkamp was dreadful. This is not the playful hyperbole of which modern writers are regularly guilty but a legitimate appraisal of his performance. He looked like he&apos;d won a competition to play in a World Cup quarter-final. Between the red cards for Numan and Ortega, Bergkamp touched the ball only three times in 11 minutes. Once he conceded a throw-in with a tackle, twice he misplaced simple passes \u2013 the second, in a dangerous area in his own half, launched the attack in which Ortega had a penalty appeal and was sent off. Even after that, in the 53 seconds between the restart and the goal, Bergkamp had time for his worst touch of the match \u2013 he tried to play a simple short pass to Marc Overmars, kicked it against his standing foot and launched an Argentina break. When that attack broke down, Holland pottered about at the back for a few seconds before Frank de Boer spotted some movement up front \u2026 Occasionally great goals come in the context of dismal personal performances. It&apos;s the great players&apos; beautiful interpretation of &quot;winning ugly&quot; \u2013 demonstrating the ability to bend games not to their will but to their skill. Ryan Giggs against Arsenal in 1999 is another significant example. Perhaps playing so poorly creates a certain freedom, an &quot;oh-bugger-it&quot; attitude (as Matthew Engel, on these pages, memorably described England&apos;s cricket against South Africa during a famous victory in 1994). Or maybe, as with so much great sport, it just happened. Frank de Boer got things going with a refresher course in the difference between a long ball and a long pass \u2013 &quot;a stretch-limo of a pass,&quot; as Cris Freddi describes it in his definitive World Cup history. Indeed, needing only four touches as it did, this was that rarest of goals: the kind that could be appreciated equally by Johan Cruyff and Charles Hughes. After the pass came the holiest of holy trinities, three perfect touches from Bergkamp. The first would have been a breathtaking piece of control even if that was the extent of the exercise. Bergkamp was so high in the air that it&apos;s almost a surprise his fear of flying didn&apos;t kick in. He was also running at full pelt, yet still managed to kill the ball with a telescopic leg and a right boot made of velvet and velcro. Even in that split-second, Bergkamp processed that he had to control it with his instep rather than the side of his foot. This interview gives an insight into the staggering amount of information a human being can process in just over two seconds: Bergkamp factored in everything from the wind to the line of the ball to the defender&apos;s movement to the angle of an eventual shot and consequent need to use his right rather than his left foot. It&apos;s easy to think Bergkamp is embellishing it but we have seen this so often; Diego Maradona, for example, showed startling total recall during a similarly career-defining goal against England in 1986. Bergkamp is unusual in that most of his great goals \u2013 Argentina, Leicester, Newcastle, Spurs \u2013 are remembered more for the first touch than the finish. He loved making goals, and it&apos;s almost as if that was his way of supplying an assist for himself. If you wanted to go the full pseud, you could call it a pre-goal. In this case, Bergkamp still had a serious amount to do even after the immaculate control. His game was all about the manipulation and creation of space \u2013 but usually that involved through balls into the spacious area behind defences. This time, with the sweeper Roberto Ayala roaring across full of misplaced determination, Bergkamp had a phonebox to work with at best. No matter; his second touch ushered Ayala off towards the wrong fire, and set him up for the shot. &quot;After the second touch I know this can&apos;t go wrong,&quot; he says. &quot;No chance!&quot; That&apos;s one way of looking at it. The other is that with each brilliant touch, the pressure to make it count becomes greater. Look at Rivaldo here after another long pass from Frank de Boer; Barcelona score, but he looks like a man who has just realised he&apos;s accidentally put the family chihuahua in the slow cooker. His face is a picture of repressed distress because he knows he missed the chance to score one of the greatest goals in history. Bergkamp took the chance to do so. By then he was in that zone \u2013 &quot;that moment&quot; \u2013 and nothing could go wrong. With the outside of his right foot, he flicked the ball past Carlos Roa and into the top corner, an appropriately elegant finish. Confirmation of the rare quality of the goal came from the BBC commentary box. &quot;Beautifully pulled down by Bergkamp \u2013 OH WHAT A GOAL! DENNIS BERGKAMP HAS WON IT FOR HOLLAND. That was absolutely brilliant.&quot; Barry Davies had not shouted as loud in the commentary for 27 years, since the &quot;Leeds will go mad&quot; game. &quot;The sound supervisor only just managed to keep my voice in range,&quot; he said later. Davies is the greatest commentator there has ever been; when he cries wolf, you know the sheep are about to get eaten. The same with Martin Tyler&apos;s commentary at the height of Serie A&apos;s most dramatic game. In Holland it was even better, with Jack Van Gelder repeatedly screaming &quot;DENNIS BERGKAMP!&quot; Van Gelder was not the only one who seemed on the cusp of tears. Bergkamp&apos;s face almost dissolved. If he was startled by his own behaviour against Yugoslavia, when he stood on Mihajlovic, he was overwhelmed by it here. He thrusted his hands straight over his face in shock. Whether subconscious or coincidental, it became a charming nod to Rinus Michels&apos;s similar reaction 10 years earlier when Marco van Basten scored his staggering volley in the European Championship final against the USSR. The Dutch have a football imagination like no other, yet sometimes they even shock themselves. As Bergkamp collapsed on his back, the camera showed a sea of Holland shirts behind the goal on a gorgeously sunny day: brilliant orange in the stands, blindingly brilliant orange on the pitch. After the game, Bergkamp was coming to terms with what he had achieved. In his post-match interview, he was a picture of self-satisfaction \u2013 the good kind. He looked like the cat who first discovered cream. Bergkamp has not watched the goal since 1998. &quot;It&apos;s still in your mind,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t really need to see it on television, I know exactly how it went.&quot; The consummate footballer-artist Dennis Bergkamp is rarely ranked among the 10 or 20 greatest players of all time. Last year, when World Soccer asked 73 journalists, managers and former players to select their all-time XI, Bergkamp did not get a single vote. He never won the Ballon d&apos;Or (though he did finish second in 1993). Yet he will endure, and with good reason. It will be seen as a bit pseudish, but the fact is that to many people Bergkamp is the consummate footballer-artist. We all want to align ourselves with the beautiful people, and Bergkamp was inevitably the subject of a kind of aspirational admiration, as if &quot;getting&quot; him would somehow imbue the 5.24am train commute and the rest of your life with greater romance and meaning. For all the brilliant things that footballers do, the pass and the first touch is the really good stuff, and Bergkamp specialised in those. His best moments represent football at its most profound. Bergkamp had a supernatural capacity for creation that hinted at a tantalising level of intelligence and technique we could appreciate even if we couldn&apos;t understand it. He specialised in moments \u2013 or rather, in moments \u2013 and Argentina was the pick of those. It was \u00fcbergkamp. &quot;You play football with your head,&quot; says Cruyff, &quot;and your legs are there to help you.&quot; If the brain is the most erogenous zone of all, then Bergkamp might be the sexiest football of the modern era. Yet all this would be try-hard horse pucky if it didn&apos;t amount to anything. Bergkamp practised what he preached when he said that &quot;art for art&apos;s sake isn&apos;t interesting&quot;. And that&apos;s why the goal against Argentina meant so much to him, more than any other. &quot;Every boy has a dream: &apos;I want to score in the World Cup.&apos; Score the winning goal in the final, of course. But in this way \u2026 to score a goal like that, in my style? The way I score a goal, on that stage, in a game that really means something, because that&apos;s important to me too. I love good football, nice football but it has to mean something.&quot; It was deep and meaningful against Argentina. &quot;I should be more of a killer,&quot; Bergkamp says in Brilliant Orange, &quot;but it&apos;s just not a quality I have.&quot; He had it for those few seconds. He was creator and killer, everything he knew he could be and something he thought he couldn&apos;t. That context is why the goal is so special to us, too. It&apos;s the point at which the two schools of football \u2013 football as art and football as a results business \u2013 come together in harmony to create a unique moment, and a perfect goal.

It would have been hard to imagine that one day we might hold the developed nations responsible and start talking about redress for victims of climate change, as we did in 2000. The nub of &quot;climate justice&quot; is the idea that the developed world made the mess and therefore the developed world should pay the price for fixing the problem. The first climate justice summit was organised to coincide with Cop 6 \u2013 the sixth session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference at the Hague in 2000. It was put together by the Rising Tide network as a radical alternative to the official talks. Roger Geffen was at the summit as a civil society activist. He says: &quot;the message we wanted put out was that what&apos;s going on at [Cop6] was the wrong ideas being discussed by the wrong people. &quot;There were all these people in the developing world who were the real victims of climate change who had not got a voice in the process.&quot; Ivonne Yanez from Oilwatch International in Ecuador co-ordinated one of the panels at the summit. Her organisation helped to bring representatives from grassroots organisations to the Hague to tell their stories. She remembers very clearly the experience of meeting Columbian grassroots representative Roberto Afanador Cobaria from the U&apos;wa people. At the time the U&apos;wa people were in the midst of a bitter battle with the oil giants Oxy, who wanted to drill on their sacred land. The U&apos;was believe that the world will end if their lands are disturbed, and they threatened to commit mass suicide if drilling began by jumping from their sacred Cliff of Death. They believed it would be better to die together than to see the end of the world. The U&apos;was eventually won their battle in 2002, and Oxy left their lands. She adds: &quot;I remember it was the first time Oilwatch really started to argue that we must &apos;leave the oil in the soil&apos; to address climate change.&quot; Kevin Smith now works for the campaign group Platform but at the time of the summit he was living in Amsterdam and working for European Youth for Action, which was part of the Rising Tide network. He says: &quot;we were inspired by the incredible resistance that was going on in the global south \u2013 the people who were on the frontline \u2013 the actions of the Ogoni people, who had been led by Ken Saro Wiwa, in resisting Shell in Nigeria was a huge inspiration for me. Those were the people who were preventing climate change \u2013 preventing climate change wasn&apos;t about a bunch of northern bureaucrats being lobbied by fuel companies in a conference centre, it was about groups like the Ogoni people who were preventing Shell from operating in the Niger Delta. &quot;These are UK companies, so I got involved because I wanted to take some responsibility for the actions of UK oil companies abroad.&quot; Fake conference passes enabled activists to get in and disrupt the COP talks. Someone put a cream pie in the face of the lead US negotiator Frank Loy during a press conference, activists got on the roof beams and showered the delegates with fake carbon credits. All the protestors&apos; activities were published in a fanzine that was distributed after the event. Yanez thinks that coming together to share ideas is always a useful process. She lists the battles that grassroots organisations have won since that first climate justice summit in 2000: the U&apos;was battle to rid themselves of oil giant Oxy; the achievements of the Ogoni people against Shell; Costa Rica&apos;s decision to declare the country an oil-free zone and the Bolivian government&apos;s decision to give greater rights to its indigenous peoples. But she also warns that there are many battles left to fight: &quot;Just yesterday we presented the Ecuadorian government with a petition signed by 750,000 people calling for a referendum on drilling for oil in the Yasuni national park. We are in a race now to save the Yasuni.&quot; The battles are the same as they ever were: people trying to minimise the effects of fossil fuel use. The difference is that after the first climate justice summit the language changed: it became more focused. Campaigners started pointing to the countless examples of people whose lives have been ruined by climate change \u2013 the subsistence farmers whose lands have been plagued by droughts and desertification \u2013 and asking very specifically: where is the justice in this? Organisations such as the the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance today links hundreds of church groups with development and humanitarian aid organisations who are working together to exert pressure on western governments to pay their dues. Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, from the alliance, told the Guardian&apos;s John Vidal: &quot;An international mechanism to address loss and damage from climate change is a clear demand of people in developing countries. Our governments cannot back down from our demand for compensation for the harm caused by the climate change locked-in by the pollution of the rich.&quot; While it may be hard to pin down the exact origins of the idea of climate justice, it is clear that the summit in 2000 was a turning point for its prominence in the climate change movement. Today we see the language of justice in the campaigns not only of grassroots organisations but that of international campaigners such as Oxfam.

Accountant and campaigner Richard Murphy said the coffee chain&apos;s small head office operation, currently in Amsterdam, was little more than a &quot;conduit or moneybox&quot; used by Starbucks to collect royalty payments and move them on to other parts of the group. &quot;There has never been an intention to make serious profits in the Netherlands and I am sure there won&apos;t be in the UK.&quot; Starbucks&apos; European head office was at the centre of criticisms 18 months ago that it had been depressing the group&apos;s tax bills around Europe by charging sister companies heavy royalty fees. Moving these headquarter operations to London is the latest example of a wave of multinationals arriving in Britain after a series of controversial tax reforms pushed through by George Osborne to woo international firms. The relocation will have no impact on the tax position of the group&apos;s coffee chain business in the UK. This operating business was heavily criticised by MPs and tax campaigners in 2012 after it emerged that the business had paid just \u00a38.3m in tax since coming to the UK in 1998, despite sales of more than \u00a33bn. On Wednesday Starbucks claimed that the head office move would &quot;mean we pay more tax in the UK&quot;, but the amount is expected to be negligible based on an analysis of head office operations in Amsterdam. Accounts filed in the Netherlands show the existing head office operation has been loss-making since 2010, and paid just \u20ac342,000 (\u00a3281,500) in tax last year. Despite amassing revenues of \u20ac92.5m for the year to September 2013, mainly in Starbucks royalty fees from regional coffee shop chains across Europe and the Middle East, Starbucks&apos; European head office made a pretax loss of \u20ac3.9m. This was after heavy deductions, including \u20ac27.8m of salary costs, primarily for executives; and a \u20ac52m payment to sister entities within the Starbucks group related to yet more royalty agreements. Not all deductions at Starbucks&apos; European HQ were allowable for corporation tax, so it did pay a small amount of tax. Any new UK tax liability arising from the shifting of the European headquarters is expected to be similarly modest. Faced with a consumer boycott, Starbucks responded with &quot;a commitment \u2026 to pay a significant amount of corporation tax during 2013 and 2014, regardless of whether our company is profitable&quot;. In truth, Starbucks did not make voluntary tax overpayments, as many had understood this promise to mean. Instead, Starbucks agreed to temporarily unwind aggressive intra-group transactions \u2013 including royalty payments \u2013 which had depressed UK taxable profits. This moratorium will expire in September. The shift to the UK is expected to involve only a handful of senior executives transferring to offices in London. Starbucks said that the move would help its executives oversee the company&apos;s largest European operation, in the UK. The group&apos;s London-based European boss Kris Engskov, who had been about to move to the Netherlands, has cancelled these plans and will remain in the UK. Engskov was previously a close adviser to Bill Clinton as US president and worked on his 1992 election campaign. During the campaign the Clinton camp attacked George Bush Sr, accusing him of being soft of taxing big business. They told voters, if elected, they could collect an additional $45bn in tax by clamping down on foreign multinationals that were aggressively shifting taxable profits out of the US. The move is not expected to impact Starbucks&apos; operational hub for Europe and the Middle East, which will continue to operate out of Amsterdam and employ more than 200 staff. This business, which supplies coffee to Starbucks coffee chains has also been the target of criticisms for the prices charged to sister companies. Critics say these prices do not reflect a market price and are designed to shift profits to more favourable tax jurisdictions \u2014 allegations Starbucks has always denied. The G20 group of countries last year ordered an overhaul of the tax treaty guidelines that govern how multinational companies transact with themselves across national borders in the wake of a series of controversies involving Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple as well as Starbucks. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last year, David Cameron appeared give his backing to public outrage at Starbucks&apos; aggressive tax treatments in the UK. He told an audience of business leaders: &quot;Some forms of avoidance have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these are ethical issues and it is time to call for more responsibility and for government&apos;s to act accordingly.&quot; In a thinly veiled jibe, he urged multinationals to &quot;wake up and smell the coffee&quot;. Behind the rhetoric, however, other G20 nations, including Germany and the US, have been growing increasingly frustrated at unilateral tax reforms pushed through by Britain which have been attracting large numbers of multinational companies to relocate their headquarters in London.

Updates on the Ashes, which England won, and prominent television coverage of the World T20 in Bangladesh, where Australia gained some revenge in the final. Now, right off the bat, it must be noted that this interest is long overdue and absolutely the least it should be. But it does start you thinking: why now? England&apos;s women cricketers have been pioneers for a while and the best team in the world for most of the past decade. So what changed? There have to be multiple contributing factors, beginning with an overall increased awareness of women&apos;s sport in Britain. Bouncing off the Olympics and Paralympics in 2012, the argument that there is no appetite for watching women compete has been shown resoundingly to be misinformed. Historically, around 5% of media coverage has been dedicated to female sports \u2013 the majority of it tennis \u2013 but last year the BBC broadcast more than 1,000 hours of women&apos;s competition, almost 20% of their sports coverage. We also can&apos;t ignore the drip-drip effect: if you do something good enough for long enough, people will eventually take notice. This is certainly true with women&apos;s cricket, where the skills of Charlotte Edwards, Sarah Taylor and Katherine Brunt have been obvious for a while. England becoming the first full-time salaried women&apos;s team from 1 May is both proof and reward of that. Something similar can be seen in women&apos;s cycling, which will belatedly now have a five-day Women&apos;s Tour across England in May and a one-day race alongside the Tour de France in July. Sadly, another factor cannot be discounted \u2013 largely because it was brought up so recurringly in the news reports. The dominance of the England women&apos;s cricket team has come at a time when their male counterparts are getting stuffed by the Netherlands \u2013 a team whose star performer was a former assistant manager of Burger King at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport. Desperate for a silver lining, the logic follows, we have turned to the motivated and cohesive women for some consolation. Does this mean we should only be interested in a sport when we are not losing at it? In recent times, Britain has enjoyed unprecedented sporting success: punching above its weight in global competitions such as the Olympics and winning events where we had been making up the numbers for decades, such as Wimbledon and the Tour de France. It has been so intoxicating that it is almost hard to remember a period when Britain did not bestride almost every sporting arena we entered. You could argue that the nation&apos;s self-esteem has been bolstered, we have walked a little taller because of these victories. And the results have certainly had a direct impact on how sport is funded. When UK Sport had to decide how to allocate \u00a3200m for Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, it rescinded all financial backing for basketball; a sport that more than 300,000 British people (70% of whom are under the age of 25) play every month. As part of a policy called &quot;no compromise&quot; \u2013 in short: no medals, no money \u2013 water polo and synchronised swimming were also cut adrift. Cycling and boxing were among the beneficiaries \u2013 as well as low\u2011participation sports such as shooting, sailing and modern pentathlon. The policy led one newspaper to compare Britain to the former East Germany: the country is equating medals with success, and confusing that sporting success with national wellbeing. This hard-headed philosophy loses sight of what sport is meant to stand for. In a week in which British Basketball has confirmed that it will not appeal against its loss of \u00a37m funding, it is hard not to feel that perhaps the country&apos;s priorities have become skewed. Team\u00a0GB may not enjoy a comparison to East Germany \u2013 it would prefer Australia in the 1990s \u2013 but the gold rush has turned into a stampede with weaker sports trampled underfoot. Britain, you may have noticed, is not a country of wildly fluctuating meteorological extremes. We do not have a magnificent spine of mountains running the length of the land. This has always made the Winter Olympics something of a low-stakes novelty for us, like singing karaoke when you don&apos;t know anyone in the audience. But now we are the all-conquering, limitation-defying Team GB; we demand results from the \u00a313.4m that UK Sport invested in the recent Sochi Olympics from lottery and exchequer funding. And in a sense we got it: the four medals (a gold, silver and two bronzes) equalled the previous best tally, which Britain claimed at the inaugural Winter Games in 1924. We were reminded of this historic achievement every hour on the sports bulletins and each evening in a jaunty graphic on Clare Balding&apos;s wrap-up programme. Just don&apos;t mention that the haul was scarcely better than Norway achieved in one event: the women&apos;s 30km cross-country. It wasn&apos;t always quite so jingoistic: self-deprecating eccentrics such as Eddie the Eagle and Frank Bruno would not become sporting heroes in modern Britain. Perhaps that&apos;s right and proper: if we are never going to be the best at, say, basketball, what&apos;s the point of pumping money into it? But now there&apos;s little doubt that it&apos;s not the taking part, it&apos;s the winning that counts. The problem with allocating money depending on success is that it ignores the cyclical, fast-changing nature of sport: Manchester United cannot dominate for ever, just as Liverpool couldn&apos;t in the 1980s. A decade ago, Britain had no culture of road cycling, now our riders have won the world&apos;s greatest race twice. England men&apos;s cricketers can be thankful that they are not dependent on funding in the same way that Olympic sports are. After the winter they&apos;ve had, they wouldn&apos;t have the cash for a Kwik Cricket set. As it is, they will be given time and resources to rebuild and return to their best. This is good news but let&apos;s just make sure that we don&apos;t forget about the women cricketers when the men do start winning again.", "sentences": ["The dominance of the England women&apos;s cricket team has come at a time when their male counterparts are getting stuffed by the Netherlands \u2013 a team whose star performer was a former assistant manager of Burger King at Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport."], "title": "Why weaker sports should not be trampled under the gold rush | Tim Lewis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/apr/19/weaker-sports-trampled-gold-rush-medals", "tags": ["Sport", "Women's cricket", "Basketball"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-20T17:00:01Z", "article": "Danny Jarvis is a football coach with a degree in leisure management. He is funny, has an independent mind and loves his job. He also suffers from cerebral palsy and relies on a full-time carer to wash and feed him. At 32 he was still a virgin until his friend, Jennie Williams, took him to a brothel in Amsterdam. For Jarvis it was a sexual awakening; for Williams, it was a wake-up call. Speaking to Jarvis after his first sexual experience, he told her he was worried it had gone badly because he didn&apos;t climax immediately. This surprised Williams, who is also managing director of the disability charity Enhance the UK. &quot;In\u00a0every other way, Danny is sociable and knowledgeable,&quot; she says. &quot;But when it came to sex he didn&apos;t know anything because he&apos;d never experienced it and no one had ever told him about it.&quot; Williams began researching sex and relationships education (SRE) for disabled people. She found that very little was available. Despite recent TV programmes and films such as Sex on Wheels and The Sessions having brought the sexuality of disabled people into the open, many are still being neglected when it comes to receiving a proper sex education. This has worrying implications for their safety, self-esteem and sexual health. According to a 2010 report by the disability charity Leonard Cheshire, almost 50% of disabled people surveyed said that they received no SRE at school. At the same time, people with severe physical disabilities are not exposed to the same everyday situations in which other young people learn about sex. They often also lack the ability and privacy to experiment with their own bodies. Jarvis&apos;s condition means that he occasionally ejaculates involuntarily. The first time this happened, he had no idea what was going on, simply because no one had taken the time to explain sex to him. His mother found it\u00a0difficult to discuss the subject and it was not addressed at his school, either.\u00a0This began to have a serious impact on\u00a0Jarvis&apos;s self-esteem. &quot;At school I was under the impression that no one would want to have sex with someone in a wheelchair,&quot; he says. By the time he was in his 20s he decided to take counselling. People with disabilities \u2013 especially those requiring round-the-clock care \u2013 can often feel desexualised, Williams says. &quot;If you have to have your bottom and face wiped for you, these are things that are associated with being a child. It is then assumed that you do not have adult sexual needs and, in the eyes of others, you become completely asexual, even if you&apos;re not.&quot; Teresa Doyle, from the sex education charity Brook, agrees. She says that schools and parents often display &quot;an utter blindness&quot; to the sexual needs of disabled pupils. In one instance, Doyle was called to a school to\u00a0help a girl with a learning disability who required a pregnancy test. The girl&apos;s teachers were convinced that she was lying because they did not believe that someone like her would\u00a0be\u00a0sexually active. The girl&apos;s pregnancy test proved positive. Doyle explains that the girl had &quot;ended up having sex because she didn&apos;t know what it was&quot;. Doyle&apos;s experience shows that SRE is vital for people with learning disabilities. A 2008 paper on teenage pregnancy in Wolverhampton states that around 28% of teenage mothers have some form of learning disability. The paper also includes figures from a special school in the same area that 40% of its female pupils had become teenage mothers within 18 months of leaving. Meanwhile, research in the Netherlands has shown that men with a learning disability are eight times more likely to contract sexually\u00a0transmitted infections than those without. In the UK, Ruth Garbutt \u2013 a research\u00a0fellow at Leeds University&apos;s centre for disability studies \u2013 has produced the report Talking About Sex\u00a0and Relationships: The Views of Young People with Learning Disabilities. It shows that sex education provision for people living with disabilities is inconsistent, both at\u00a0mainstream and special schools \u2013 and that teenagers are left vulnerable because of these shortcomings. One parent told Garbutt that her son had pulled out all his pubic hair because he was ashamed of it. Another reported that their son was caught having sex with men in public toilets. &quot;If he&apos;d known more about what was safe and unsafe, and what was public and private then he might not have got into that situation,&quot; Garbutt says. Garbutt also heard that some doctors and teachers were advising parents not to talk about sex to their disabled children. Williams believes this sweep-it-under-the-carpet approach must change. &quot;The truth is that disabled people have sex and disabled people like sex.

He is also chief conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra; his current contract there comes to an end in 2018. Jansons&apos; leadership of the Amsterdam orchestra has been a period of especial success and acclaim. In 2008 the orchestra was voted &quot;the world&apos;s greatest&quot; by an international panel of music critics; CDs and DVDs by Jansons with the RCO on its own label, RCO Live, have received countless international prizes, and in 2011 Jansons was named &quot;conductor of the year&quot; by German magazine Opernwelt. His recent residency with the orchestra at London&apos;s Barbican saw him hailed as a &quot;master of balance and texture.&quot;  In a press release, the orchestra, the management and the chief conductor stated that they are parting on excellent terms and with deep mutual respect.

The RCO announced on Tuesday that the celebrated conductor will retire at the end of the 2015 season from what is widely considered to be one of the greatest posts in the orchestral world. The news of his departure came as a surprise even to those in his orchestra, despite health concerns. In April 1996, Latvian-born Jansons nearly died on stage in Oslo from a heart attack while conducting the final pages of Puccini&apos;s La Boh\u00e8me. An official at the RCO said: &quot;It&apos;s no secret that he has health problems.&quot; The exact date of the 71-year-old&apos;s last performance has not been determined, the RCO said, adding: &quot;The orchestra, management and the chief conductor want to make a point of stating that they are parting on excellent terms and with deep mutual respect.&quot; It said: &quot;Mariss Jansons has always been able to inspire the orchestra and lead it in great performances. Due to his knowledge, commitment and involvement, he is much loved by both musicians and his audiences.&quot; The son of a conductor, Jansons studied violin in St Petersburg before travelling to Vienna and Salzburg to learn under the internationally renowned conductors, Hans Swarowsky and Herbert von Karajan. He went on to conduct the BBC Welsh Symphony orchestra before becoming chief conductor at the RCO in 2004. Musicians and classical critics played tribute to Jansons&apos;s long and eminent career as a conductor. Dominic Seldis, the RCO&apos;s principal double bass player, said Jansons was &quot;more dedicated than anybody I&apos;ve ever worked with&quot; and he would miss him terribly. &quot;Mariss pushes himself so incredibly hard and he worked fifty times harder than all of us put together,&quot; said Seldis. &quot;Yes, news of his departure was a surprise but in a way it&apos;s a relief because his health has not been getting any better.&quot; He continued: &quot;We will all remember him for his detail, passion and immense musicality and knowledge. He is the don. There is nothing in every score he conducts that he hasn&apos;t read, researched, discussed, thought about and worried about. &quot;Working with him, the depth of knowledge and musicality is amazing. It was a complete and utter privilege to have worked with him and it is even more of a privilege to call him a friend. I will miss him but I&apos;m delighted that he has finished on a high that is fitting to both a great conductor and a great man.&quot; Seldis said that while Jansons&apos;s replacement still remained unknown, he believed the RCO was ready for the next chapter. &quot;The orchestra is on great form,&quot; he added. &quot;We&apos;ve had the most unbelievable year, with our 125th anniversary, so we are now just looking forward to whoever steps up.&quot; Jansons was appointed assistant to the conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky of the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra in 1973. From 1979 to 2000 he was chief conductor at the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra. The classical critic Geoffrey Norris described Jansons as &quot;one of the greatest conductors of his generation&quot; and praised his inspiring and humanising touch. &quot;Jansons always said that he likes his performances to be cosmic and I think when he&apos;s at his best, this is what you get,&quot; said Norris. &quot;You find yourself completely transported by his musicianship and the way he can inspire orchestras to achieve their absolute best.&quot; He added: &quot;I&apos;ve been following Jansons since the 1980s when he was conductor of the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra. He cut his teeth there and I remember even in those days you felt that you were listening to a musician of extraordinary ability who could really transform you as you listened. &quot;He has a very rare ability to communicate his ideas to orchestras and inspire them in their music making.&quot; Nicholas Kenyon, the managing director of the Barbican, which hosted the RCO in 2012, also paid tribute. &quot;The partnership between Mariss Jansons and the Concertgebouw has been one of the world&apos;s great musical relationships over the last decade and they have just given us three unforgettable Bruckner symphonies at the Barbican,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s of course a huge pity that will be coming to an end next year and I hope Mariss will continue giving us his peerless music-making for many years to come.&quot; Jansons will continue in his post as chief conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in Munich, where his contract lasts until 2018.", "sentences": ["The chief conductor of Amsterdam&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Mariss Jansons, is to step down after leading the world-famous ensemble for a decade."], "title": "Mariss Jansons, renowned conductor, to step down", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/22/mariss-jansons-conductor-concertgebouw-step-down", "tags": ["Mariss Jansons", "Classical music", "Netherlands", "Europe", "Music", "Culture", "World news", "Conducting"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-22T19:39:00Z", "article": "Labour&apos;s decision to double-down on squeezed living standards \u2013 as exemplified by last week&apos;s appointment of Obama adviser David Axelrod \u2013 reflects a gamble at the top of the party that the issue will continue to resonate despite what is expected to be a daily drumbeat of better economic news. Party officials have discussed at length the so-called &quot;crossover&quot; \u2013 the moment when wages rose faster than prices \u2013 and rejected any suggestion that it meant the living standards agenda had reached political or intellectual exhaustion. They believe the subject is a symbol of an economy that is not working for most people, opening a wider argument about a government for the elite. Labour&apos;s persistence may be justified by recent polling: YouGov published figures at the weekend showing 84% agree that &quot;in the last few years most people&apos;s incomes have not kept pace with rising prices&quot; \u2013 a figure that the latest wage and inflation figures last week have not altered. Those that follow the living standards debate most closely, such as the thinktank Resolution Foundation, say there is no chance that over the five years of this parliament living standards per head will have risen. The two big flaws for Miliband \u2013 which his staff were warned were likely to happen \u2013 are first that wages will rise faster than prices in most of the final year of the parliament, and second that few Britons directly blame the government for the living standards squeeze. YouGov&apos;s polling this weekend shows only 21% blame the present government for this, while 22% blame the last Labour government. Peter Kellner, the YouGov President wrote &quot;Most people, 57%, don&apos;t take sides: they blame both parties, or aren&apos;t sure, or don&apos;t think there is a crisis, or fear the problem is beyond the control of politicians&quot;. According to Kellner, the figures then get worse for Labour. He wrote: &quot;On three aspects where Labour held clear leads six months ago, the race has tightened: providing more jobs (Labour lead down from 8% to 1%), keeping prices down (lead down from 6% to 1%) and &quot;improving the standards of living for people like you&quot; (9% lead down to 4%). &quot;In contrast, two big Tory leads have grown even bigger \u2013 on managing the economy (lead up from 15% to 21%) and tackling the government&apos;s deficit (lead up from 22% to 29%).&quot;      Of course anyone who sets their political compass according to the oscillating mood of the YouGov daily tracker, will be seriously disorientated. But one Labour insider who has pressed for the party to say more about the deficit for two years concedes the party has no choice but to stick with the current script. He said: &quot;Until recently I would have said there are centrifugal forces at every general election that drive the agenda onto tax, spend and the deficit. I would have also said talking only living standards and high prices will look like to a lot of the electorate as way of avoiding the main subject \u2013 the deficit \u2013 and if voters can sniff out evasion, they will act accordingly. &quot;There is a danger than Labour will try to avoid the subject by talking about a zero based spending review after the election and some tax rises. Talking about closing a few fire stations is not really enough. But now I think Labour should stick with living standards.&quot;The bigger prize for Labour is to broaden &quot;living standards&quot; into something more than a moan about high prices, but a wider discussion about the recovery, the inbuilt unfairness of modern capitalism and why the link between the wealth of the country as a whole and people&apos;s own finances, has broken. It is something Obama and Axelrod have articulated in their attacks on the way the top 1% have drifted away from the rest of society. Miliband and his chief thinker Lord Stewart Wood, have tried to articulate something similar, but have so far held back fearful of something that ends up as bash the rich. The impression now is the Left across Europe is coming to a similar analysis about inequality, and that without structural remedial action this will be another recovery for the rich. Policy Network, the thinktank probably closest to social democratic thinking in Europe, is holding a conference on Thursday in Amsterdam on what it describes as the emergence of a &quot;5-75-20&quot; society, one in which an increasing share of GDP is flowing to capital at the expense of labour. By this it means roughly 5% at the top \u2013 professionals working in finance and those who inherit wealth \u2013 are enjoying &apos;runaway&apos; rewards as asset prices and returns to wealth have soared while there are 20% at the &apos;bottom&apos; of society are at risk of permanent marginalisation. The middle 75% are usually in work or have retirement incomes, but are apprehensive: they not only comprise &quot;blue-collar&quot; employees threatened by outsourcing, but middle-class professionals who fear their jobs will be next. The Policy Network argues a stable governing majority cannot be fashioned on the basis of appealing simply to the bottom 20%, even with factoring in the votes of an altruistic middle class. Nor can a credible electoral programme be devised for a strategy of redistribution from the elite: from conventional sources of income tax, there simply isn&apos;t enough money to spread around. &quot;Social democracy&apos;s new majority has to be built on something more radical than compensatory redistribution,&quot; it concludes. These arguments have been given intellectual historical ballast by Thomas Piketty, the French economist author of Capital in the Twenty-First Century, a 700 page journey through the history of wages and incomes laced with graphs, Jane Austen and Balzac. He argues there is a deep historical tendency for the rate of return on capital to outstrip the overall rate of economic growth, leading to greater and greater concentrations of wealth at the very top. Piketty writes: In the book the economist warns &quot;There&apos;s a real risk that we will wake up to find a society even more inegalitarian than that of the 19th century, because it will combine the arbitrariness of inherited inequalities with a meritocratic discourse that makes the &apos;losers&apos; responsible for their situation,&quot; Piketty writes. Piketty has attracted the interest of Milbandites and is due to give lectures here next week at left leaning thinktanks. A book tour in New York has seen him propelled to number one on Amazon&apos;s best seller list, pushing aside science fiction mega-hit &quot;Divergent&quot; . Selling a book about capitalism&apos;s iniquities to liberal New Yorkers may not be the same as winning over a sceptical swing voter in Milton Keynes, but either way Miliband has made his choice. This will, if he has his way, be the living standards election.", "sentences": ["Policy Network, the thinktank probably closest to social democratic thinking in Europe, is holding a conference on Thursday in Amsterdam on what it describes as the emergence of a &quot;5-75-20&quot; society, one in which an increasing share of GDP is flowing to capital at the expense of labour."], "title": "Labour bets on living standards being key issue as 2015 elections near", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/22/labour-bets-living-standards-elections-miliband-economy", "tags": ["Pay", "Labour", "Ed Balls", "UK news", "Politics", "Family finances", "Inflation", "Ed Miliband", "Economics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-23T12:27:47Z", "article": "Justin Bieber has apologised after posting a photograph that showed him standing in front of the controversial Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo. The Canadian pop singer removed the image but only after it had been tweeted to his 51.1 million followers and attracted 660,000 likes on Instagram. Bieber, who earlier in the week made a trip to the less politically combustible Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, later said he had been unaware of the shrine&apos;s controversial role, and issued an apology. &quot;While in Japan I asked my driver to pull over for which I saw a beautiful shrine,&quot; he wrote on Instagram. &quot;I was mislead to think the shrines were only a place of prayer. To anyone I have offended I am extremely sorry. I love you China and I love you Japan.&quot; China and South Korea regard Yasukuni, which honours leaders executed for war crimes among 2.5 million Japanese war dead, as a potent symbol of Japanese militarism. Pilgrimages by Japanese politicians provoke angry outbursts from China, which sees the visits as evidence of Tokyo&apos;s failure to atone for atrocities committed on the Asian mainland, including in parts of China, in the 1930s and 40s. Bieber&apos;s &quot;impromptu&quot; stop at Yasukuni came a day after 150 Japanese MPs paid homage at the shrine. Earlier in the week, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, sent a ritual offering but stopped short of visiting in person, in an apparent attempt to avoid controversy on the eve of Barack Obama&apos;s arrival in Tokyo. One Instagram photo showed Bieber, dressed in a white baseball cap, long hoodie and boots, standing in front of the shrine next to an unidentified person who has his head bowed. The caption reads: &quot;Thank you for your blessings.&quot; In another, the 20-year-old&apos;s hands are clasped together in prayer as he stands beside a shrine employee in religious robes. The posts prompted a flurry of comment online. &quot;Hey Justin, do u even know where that is?&quot; wrote Instagram user vivien\u2014kong. &quot;Yasukuni shrine is the place where to worship the Japanese WWII soldiers. And do u have any efing idea that how the Japanese Nazi killed American and other Asian countries innocents?&quot; Others were more critical. &quot;Maybe you are a giant in Japan and thats the reason why you like Japan,&quot; a Chinese user commented. &quot;Anyway, please dont come to China forever, we really dont like stupid people.&quot; Another pleaded with him to remove the image. Officials in Beijing said they were unaware of the visit, and appeared to give the singer the benefit of the doubt. Qin Gang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said he hoped Bieber had left Yasukuni with &quot;a clear understanding of Japan&apos;s history of invasion and militarism, and of the source of Japan&apos;s militarism&quot;.

He had read an article in the Observer and decided that I was producing the kind of theatre that he wanted to be involved with. British labour laws prevented me from hiring him, but I said that he could participate in the activities of the theatre, so he left his job running a Dublin detective agency and moved to Edinburgh. He directed a number of Traverse productions, the two most successful being The Fantasticks and A Child&apos;s Christmas in Wales. Jack was a voracious play-reader. One day, he announced that he had discovered a playwright who should become a Traverse writer. This turned out to be CP Taylor. The Traverse produced a half-dozen or more of Taylor&apos;s plays. When, in 1966, the Traverse opened a London offshoot, Jack assisted. We had two plays transfer to bigger theatres, both directed by Charles Marowitz: Joe Orton&apos;s Loot and two one-acts by Saul Bellow. Jack played a major role when I started the Arts Laboratory in Covent Garden in 1967, co-directing one of our big hits, Jane Arden&apos;s Vagina Rex and the Gas Oven, and designing both our cinema and our theatre. He created the first video cinema by converting old pre-war British TV sets into video projectors, and founded Videoheads, a collective of artists interested in using the new video technology in their work. Jack wrote many articles for the underground paper IT (International Times), as well as acting as editor, and was also active in the pop club UFO, the newspaper Suck and the Wet Dream film festival. When, after three years, the Arts Lab closed, Jack moved to Amsterdam, where he helped to create a similar venture, the Melkweg (the Milky Way), and became more and more involved with video. He worked with Unesco and the Sony Corporation, teaching and installing video units in India, the Middle East, and Central and South America. Jack was born in Oklahoma, and began studying engineering at the University of Oklahoma, but switched to the theatre department, and upon graduating headed for New York City, where he worked on Broadway and off-Broadway. It was during this period, while visiting the family of a friend, that he was offered the job in Dublin. Openly gay, he came out of the closet extremely early.

We were the merry pranksters of Britpop. A punk, a rocker and a soul boy. I was the one who worked in a record store and used to put Crass records inside Duran Duran sleeves. In 1994 we were recording our second album at the same time, and in the same studio, that the Stone Roses were making theirs. That&apos;s where the [Ian Brown as] King Monkey thing comes from. The Guardian&apos;s Caroline Sullivan phoned us up and said: &quot;I hear you&apos;ve been in the studio with the Roses, have you got anything to say?&quot; So we told her that he only answered to the name King Monkey, and that they&apos;d been doing a version of [the Gap Band&apos;s] Oops Upside Your Head. Total fabrication. Mathew [Priest, drums], Andy [Miller, guitar] and I moved down from Worcestershire in 1988. All the bands were shoegazey or &quot;grebo&quot; like Pop Will Eat Itself and the Wonder Stuff. And then came grunge, and we weren&apos;t into that. We wanted melody. It was a hark back to the 60s. Looking back it was a bit of a golden age. Glastonbury 1997 was the high point. We were third on the bill. People come up to me and say: &quot;That was the greatest festival of my life!&quot; You&apos;re somehow in people&apos;s lives without even realising it. We weren&apos;t really a Britpop band. We just got caught up in it. We were a displaced American band, influenced by Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. Going on Top of the Pops with Good Enough was a highlight, but really my life carried on as usual. I was already 30 and had a three-bedroom semi in Stoke Newington, and a Jeep because I had kids. By 1998, the excitement had gone, so I moved back to Worcestershire. I taught music technology for a couple of years \u2013 I actually taught a Britpop course, although admittedly I was a bit biased towards Dodgy. Then I worked with troublesome kids and homeless people, teaching them songwriting. In 2007, Dodgy got back together \u2013 for creative reasons, not for the nostalgia. We put out a new album two years ago and we&apos;ve just started another one. These days, I live with my partner and two teenagers, Mathew teaches drums down in Dorset, and Andy lives in Hackney.

Drink Me got to No\u00a016 in the album charts. We thought it was fantastic. People were recognising us, and we were having so much fun on the road travelling through Europe on our minibus, in our little cocoon. I thought: &quot;This is the life.&quot; Then we got the confidence knocked out of us. Nobody can be prepared for the music industry. It was very catty and playgroundish. Blur asked us to support them on tour, and Justine Frischmann [of Elastica] wouldn&apos;t talk to me because she was the frontman&apos;s girlfriend. She confessed that she was a little bit nervous that he might fall in love with me! Later we became friends. The media created competition between us and the so-called Female Fronted Indie Bands [Elastica, Sleeper, Echobelly et al]. We thought we were very different from them, in terms of chord changes and subject matter. Drink the Elixir, our best-known song, was about a man who drank a young woman&apos;s pee. We carried on till 1998. We had a second album, Ice Cream, which we should have called Bridesmaid&apos;s Gimmicks after our song of that name. We didn&apos;t because our manager&apos;s wife didn&apos;t like it. We didn&apos;t know who we were any more.

That&apos;s why we called our debut album Expecting To Fly \u2013 it was a nod to Buffalo Springfield. We were a bit more transatlantic than the Fred Perry and Adidas brigade. We never asked to become part of the Britpop club \u2013 all that Cool Britannia shit: Noel Gallagher shaking hands with Tony Blair. I thought: &quot;It&apos;s not meant to be cosy!&quot; Success happened so quickly. We were getting used to playing gigs of 250, so to go from that to playing to thousands was mindblowing. It felt awkward, like we crashed someone else&apos;s party. We didn&apos;t realise we&apos;d be on that many front covers or TV programmes. A big hit single elevated us to a league where we didn&apos;t feel comfortable. It was like the Last Days of Sodom. We went from one party to another. We had tables at the Brits next to Prince and Sheryl Crow. We didn&apos;t have to go and score. We had people offering us drugs left, right and centre. Heroin didn&apos;t ever really enter our orbit, but we were five guys from Hounslow who wouldn&apos;t have got a second look down at the local disco. All of a sudden we were big news. You do that to a 24-year-old and there are going to be consequences. By 2000, we seemed old hat. It&apos;s like Logan&apos;s Run \u2013 it&apos;s a young person&apos;s game. We had small children and we weren&apos;t making it work, so we called it a day in 2011. Our last gig was in Osaka, Japan. It was the best place to do it because it afforded us the opportunity to be together, without any friends or obligations. The crew left us alone and we had time to reflect. I&apos;m making it sound like a trip to the vets! But we were actually kissing goodbye to our youth. It was heartbreaking. Then we got embezzled out of thousands of pounds when our manager did a moonlight flit. That was pretty bad. But it hasn&apos;t soured the memory of it all. We had a bloody good time. I just released my second solo album. Adam [Devlin, guitar] plays guitar for new bands and he and his girlfriend do photography. Scott [Morriss, bass] is an animator \u2013 he just did the video for my next single. Eds [Chesters, drums] is a fully qualified osteopath. We still get royalties, even if it&apos;s not quite enough to crack open the cava. You can&apos;t live off one platinum album, even if I do think it&apos;s a bit of a lost classic.

I was living in Macclesfield \u2013 I used to pay Ian Curtis regular visits in the local cemetery. We were influenced by the Smiths, Joy Division and We were both being pitched by the NME as stars of 1994. We were all 17 to 18 and had lived safe suburban, sheltered lives, so it was great to be part of the Manchester scene and meet all the characters. It took a year to get our songs together, buy some nice clothes and instruments and become the hip young people we wanted to be. We got record companies interested, and there was a bidding war. All the labels came up to see us, and we got absolutely legless. We toured with Radiohead and Morrissey \u2013 touring with Morrissey remains one of the highlights of my life. He was so charming and funny. And Radiohead were amazing. Thom Yorke said Marion had emerged in the same way as Radiohead, without hype, by gigging hard. I felt honoured that they made that connection. Sleep was used in a Citro\u00ebn car advert. We ended up getting about \u00a3150,000. I spent my share on clothes, drink and drugs. It was an incredible time to be travelling the world. There was Marionmania in Japan. They even made Jaime dolls. We worked so furiously creating [debut album] This World and Body, touring it worldwide for two years, that by the time we came back to work on [1998&apos;s] The Program we&apos;d hit a brick wall, energy-wise. Joe helped massively by bringing in Johnny Marr [for production], and he breathed life into it. We wouldn&apos;t have done a second album without him. Then I started doing way too many drugs \u2013 the wrong drugs. I&apos;d always used speed and cocaine but the heroin really took hold round the making of The Program. Johnny hated it because he&apos;d dealt with that part of his life a long time ago. We were supposed to get Chrissie Hynde in for backing vocals but she&apos;d had bandmates who&apos;d died from drug use and she&apos;d have been disgusted. Johnny and the band, and Joe, stuck by me for way longer than they should have. But by the time the record was finished, I was good for nothing. I&apos;m 39 now and I&apos;ve been trying to recover ever since. I blew one of my heart valves from injecting heroin and crack in 2006, so I had to have open heart surgery and a metal valve placed in my heart. It was a year being in and out of hospital for six weeks at a time. The amount of medication I have to take now for my heart condition and my opiate addiction is quite a battle. I moved back to Manchester recently. I live alone with my cat, Bolanboogie. I&apos;ve started playing guitar and Joe is managing me again. I&apos;m getting stronger all the time. I&apos;m not clean \u2013 it&apos;s going to take a good while longer. But I&apos;ll get there. I&apos;m still cool as fuck, so I&apos;m going to have a go. I&apos;m not physically in a position to get a job so I survive with the generosity of friends and by living frugally. I don&apos;t have expensive tastes any more. I love to read and watch movies. I&apos;ve been doing Marion on and off since 2006. We recorded a live album at Manchester Academy in 2011. We did a tour in April 2012 and that was amazing \u2013 we sold out Islington Academy in London and that was an incredible show. But then Phil [Cunningham]&apos;s New Order commitments took over. Johnny used to say of Marion that we had the respect of our peers. If we&apos;d have held it together into the period of bands like Coldplay and Travis, I think we would have done commercially massively better.

Originally it was me, him and Chris [Gentry, guitar]. Menswe@r&apos;s name was given to us by Steve Mackey of Pulp who we knew because we&apos;d been in the video to Do You Remember the First Time?. I thought it was hilarious, and very knowing. We were reacting to grunge. I&apos;d started wearing suits, and then [Blur&apos;s] Modern Life is Rubbish happened. Young people in Britain were ready for something they could relate to. Britpop was a mixture of Merseybeat, glam, punk, even new romantic. To me it also included the Chemical Brothers and the Prodigy, even Underworld \u2013 Born Slippy was a Britpop anthem. Melody Maker put us on the cover very early on, which was the reason we became whipping boys. We did more interviews than write songs. It was too much. Everyone seemed to lose it. Record companies were throwing money around like crazy. We got 90 grand from London, and our publishing deal was half a million. There was a lot of heavy Class A action. It&apos;s probably no coincidence that the big Britpop movie was Trainspotting. We did have a No 11 album and three top 20 hits. All our singles got in the top 40 and we were on Top of the Pops quite regularly. Def Leppard said it was nice that there was another band on TOTP who rocked. Lionel Richie was really nice \u2013 he even asked for a copy of Being Brave, which was pretty surreal. From the outside it all seemed like a jolly pastiche of 1966 London and everyone was doing the Lambeth Walk, but at the centre of it all it got quite dark. The behaviour was monstrous. I saw a lot of things that would make other people&apos;s hair curl. We were kids, with an average age of 19. We had no idea how the music business worked and it can be a nasty place. I didn&apos;t want to know any more by 1998. For some reason, it was decided that our second album should be country rock. By then it was all causing us a lot of mental damage. It was doomed. After leaving the band, I became depressed, although I&apos;ve had problems with depression since I was a kid. I did temping for a while and worked in offices, trying to pay the bills. I had a massive breakdown and was put on a psychiatric ward. I always suspected I might have a neurological condition, and eventually I was diagnosed with Asperger&apos;s and pervasive developmental disorder. Now I work a lot with the National Autistic Society. I&apos;m 42, and living a quiet life in Teddington. Last year I did a David Bowie tribute gig \u2013 it was my first time onstage for 15 years. And I&apos;ve been gigging as Menswe@r. As long as the singer&apos;s singing, it doesn&apos;t really matter who&apos;s playing the instruments. Chris and Simon [White, guitar] manage Bloc Party and Phoenix, Matt [Everitt] is on BBC Radio 6, he does the Music News, so they&apos;re all doing well. But I don&apos;t want anything to do with them. You should be careful who you form a band with and make sure you&apos;re on the same page. We weren&apos;t, and that caused problems. Menswe@r divided opinion and we still do. You either loved us or absolutely hated us. But that&apos;s great. I didn&apos;t want to be Coldplay. Britpop was a party, one that Menswe@r gatecrashed. And although the hangover might have lasted 20 years, at least I was there. \u2022 Michael Hann: Britpop was a cultural abomination", "sentences": ["I also do voiceovers \u2013 I was the announcer on the nominations packages for the MTV Europe music awards in Amsterdam."], "title": "Britpop casualties: 'It felt like we crashed someone else's party'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/24/britpop-bluetones-dodgy-salad-marion-menswear-indie-90s", "tags": ["Britpop", "Indie", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-24T18:29:02Z", "article": "There are some very big guns in the running for the 2014 Museum of the Year, literally in the case of the Mary Rose Museum, and then there is a minnow: a small centre celebrating the amazing artists who were attracted to the pretty South Downs village of Ditchling. On Thursday evening The Art Fund named a shortlist of six organisations which will be finalists in this year&apos;s award, with the winner receiving \u00a3100,000. They are Tate Britain, the Hayward Gallery, London, Yorkshire Sculpture Park near Wakefield, the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth, the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in Norwich, and the Ditchling Museum of Art and Craft in East Sussex. The chairman of the judges, Stephen Deuchar, who is the director of the Art Fund, said the quality of applications this year had been extraordinary. &quot;It is almost as if imaginative and innovative curatorship, combined with the highest standards of presentation, is no longer the exception but the rule,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a curatorial intelligence which underpins the success of the displays and people like Penelope Curtis at Tate Britain, Ralph Rugoff at the Hayward and Paul Greenhalgh at the Sainsbury Centre are remarkable curators as well as directors.&quot; Tate Britain is shortlisted after its \u00a345m redevelopment which brought strengthened floors, revamped galleries and helped restore a lot of the original building&apos;s glory. There was also a complete rehang of its permanent collection, more than 500 works displayed chronologically to give visitors a walk through 500 years of British art history. Its shortlisting will be particularly pleasing for the Tate given recent criticism directed at its director Curtis - the Sunday Times critic Waldemar Januszczak declared the gallery such a mess that she had to go. The \u00a327m Mary Rose Museum opened last spring and has attracted around 400,000 visitors. It sits about 20 yards from where the warship, the flagship of Henry VIII&apos;s navy, was built in 1510. It displays thousands of artefacts from the ship and at its centre, most thrillingly of all, is what remains of the Mary Rose. The Ditchling museum reopened last year after a \u00a32.3m revamp that improves the presentation of its collection while examining the remarkable number of talented artists, weavers and silversmiths who were attracted to the village&apos;s bucolic charms. The Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts also redeveloped its galleries and redisplayed its permanent collection, a remarkable modern art collection that was originally left to it by Robert and Lisa Sainsbury in 1973. One notable event for the Yorkshire Sculpture Park was successfully saving Roger Hiorns&apos; work Seizure, a remarkable project in which the artist covered the walls of a Peckham council flat with copper sulphate crystals. It opened in June. IThe Hayward is shortlisted after a year in which very little was spent on its infrastructure \u2013 it is nominated instead for eclectic and experimental programming which included touring exhibitions such as All That Is Solid Melts Into Air, curated by Jeremy Deller and shows in its South Bank home which brought the &quot;unknown and unexpected&quot; to UK audiences. A judging panel consisting of Sally Bacon, the executive director of the Clore Duffield Foundation, the artist Michael Craig-Martin, Wim Pijbes, director of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and Anna Somers Cocks, the chief executive of The Art Newspaper, will now visit all six museums before the winner is named on 9 July.

Film reviewers and pop journalists were joined by movie critics and rock writers, who brought scholarly rigour to the study and interpretation of films and songs. One of the most influential of this new breed was Phil Hardy, who has died aged 69 after a heart attack. Phil was a pioneering writer and encyclopedia editor, and in later years a respected and independent-minded commentator on the international music business. Phil was born in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, the only child of a Polish father and Yorkshire-born mother, whose surname he took. After attending St Aloysius grammar school in Highgate, north London, he went to Sussex University. There he pursued American studies, and his love of American culture blossomed during a year at the University of California, Berkeley (1968-69). He returned to the Sussex campus with a stash of LPs by the likes of Frank Zappa and Quicksilver Messenger Service, and a collection of psychedelic posters. He was by now an ardent film enthusiast, and with a group of friends staged an electoral coup to take control of the university film society. The society&apos;s funds supported the Brighton Film Review, a critical journal co-founded by Phil, Gary Herman and Thomas Elsaesser, now professor of cinema at the University of Amsterdam. Next, Phil conceived and edited Rockbooks, a series of intelligently written and elegantly designed studies of individual artists. Four of these appeared in 1971, but the series foundered as its production company went under in controversial circumstances. Undeterred, Phil pressed on to co-edit with me a three-volume Encyclopedia of Rock, whose success was due to its distinguished consultant editors, who included Charlie Gillett and Greil Marcus, and to the dynamism of our publisher at Panther, Nick Webb. In the late 90s, we were able to reprise this project as the Faber Companion to 20th-Century Popular Music. By the end of the 70s, Phil had begun to investigate the activities of the music business. He became an adviser to the Greater London Enterprise Board, an offshoot of Ken Livingstone&apos;s Greater London council, and in 1986 he travelled to East Africa to research and script Food, Trucks and Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll, a documentary film examining how the funds raised by Band Aid had been spent. Much later, he was to advise the World Bank on its plans to invest in the African music industry. From 1992, Phil was the editor of Financial Times Music &amp; Copyright, an industry newsletter widely read by record company executives, media analysts and policymakers. This was launched after Phil and I, as his co-founder, had managed to persuade sceptical FT managers that the music industry was more than just a bunch of overpaid exhibitionists and drug takers. Phil edited the newsletter for more than 20 years until its new owners decided it should be run in-house. He refused the offer of a consultant role, cherishing his freedom of action. If it is true that freelances either have many bosses or only one (themselves), Phil was always of the latter camp. He briefly ran an online publication, before setting out in 2010 to write a series of books about the history of the music industry. Download! came out in 2013 from Omnibus Press, which will issue his study of music publishing later this year. At the time of his death, he was working on a volume charting the rise of Universal Music, the world&apos;s largest record company. Phil never lost his love of cinema. He wrote studies of the directors Sam Fuller and Raoul Walsh in the 70s, and in the 80s edited five definitive encyclopedias of individual genres. A British Film Institute Companion to Crime followed in 1991. Phil was married to Carole James, a polytechnic lecturer, who died in 1989. He later formed a partnership with the Oscar-winning set decorator Stephenie McMillan. The couple moved to a farm in rural Norfolk a decade ago. Stephenie died in 2013. Phil is survived by Joel and Emily, his children with Carole, and two grandchildren. \u2022 Philippe George Hardy, author, journalist and editor, born 7 April 1945; died 8 April 2014", "sentences": ["The society&apos;s funds supported the Brighton Film Review, a critical journal co-founded by Phil, Gary Herman and Thomas Elsaesser, now professor of cinema at the University of Amsterdam."], "title": "Phil Hardy obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/25/phil-hardy", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Music", "Books", "UK news", "Film", "Film", "Law", "Sentencing", "Judiciary", "Media", "Barristers", "University of Cambridge", "Working Title"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-25T13:39:00Z", "article": "A flashing neon sign hangs over the grand entrance to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Art Is Therapy, it reads, mirroring the cover of Alain de Botton&apos;s recent book Art as Therapy, written with the philosopher and art historian John Armstrong. The Rijksmuseum reopened last year after major reorganisation and restoration, to almost universal acclaim. It had more than 3 million visitors in 2013. They thought they had a museum; what they have is a crammed-to-the-gills tourist attraction. It&apos;s the Tate Modern effect. Perhaps troubled that 3 million visitors was not quite enough, Rijksmuseum director Wim Pijbes invited De Botton and Armstrong to make an &quot;intervention&quot;. The authors have filled the place with loud, intrusive labels \u2013 giant Post-it notes that often dwarf the exhibits \u2013 along with a number of thematic displays.     No escape \u2026 one of the philosophers' labels at the Rijksmuseum. Photograph: Olivier Middendorp    You can&apos;t avoid the crowds, and there is no escape from the labels: in the entrance hall, on the stairs, in the grand salons that connect the galleries, as well as beside and beneath the exhibits. People are spending longer reading the damn things than looking at the art. &quot;You suffer from fragility, guilt, a split personality, self disgust,&quot; reads a note next to Jan Steen&apos;s 1660s genre painting The Feast of Saint Nicholas. &quot;You are probably a bit like this picture,&quot; the label goes on. &quot;There are sides of you that are a little debauched.&quot; The labels tell us what&apos;s wrong with us, and how the artworks and artefacts they accompany can cure our ills. In front of Rembrandt&apos;s Night Watch, the crowning glory of the collection, another big yellow label tells us what it believes we are thinking: &quot;I can&apos;t bear busy places \u2013 I wish this room were emptier.&quot; De Botton sees the Night Watch as an image of communality, which I suppose it is. There&apos;s not much fellow-feeling in the audience around it, and I guess that&apos;s the point, too.     One of the exhibition's yellow labels \u2026  Photograph: Olivier Middendorp    Next to Vermeer&apos;s Woman Reading a Letter and his quiet Delft street scene, beside teapots and Chinese gods, alongside an Yves Saint Laurent dress and a Rietveld chair, the labels proliferate. De Botton is trying to mend what he sees as a disconnection between art and life, between past and present. This is an unexceptional ambition. Artists and designers do it all the time. Why do we need De Botton? In a display of 19thcentury daguerrotypes, under the curatorial theme of memory, we are told we are in &quot;one of the saddest rooms in the museum. You might want to cry.&quot; Why? All the people in the pictures are dead. They generally are in photographs this old. Banality and bathos are the stock-in-trade here. De Botton&apos;s curatorial rubrics \u2013 as well as memory, there&apos;s fortune, money, politics and sex \u2013 are anodyne, his insights and descriptions shallow and obvious. De Botton insists that art can tell us how to live: &quot;It should heal us: it isn&apos;t an intellectual exercise, an abstract aesthetic arena or a distraction for a Sunday afternoon.&quot; His petulant tone is wearing. I also dislike the self-improvement shtick. In front of an athletic bit of statuary, a label inquires why, if we can accept going to the gym to improve our bodies, we don&apos;t visit the museum &quot;to work on our character&quot;.     Banality and bathos are the stock-in-trade \u2026  Photograph: Olivier Middendorp    De Botton is like one of those &quot;Jesus is your best mate&quot; Christians, giving us not one but 150 thoughts for the day, on the ubiquitous labels, audioguide and downloadable app. He wants museums to become temples of virtue, places of instruction that go far beyond their usual remit of caring for and displaying centuries of culture. He&apos;d probably also like to replace burgeoning museum education departments with outposts of his School of Life, a sort of drop-in self-help centre which, just this week, opened a branch in Amsterdam. De Botton thinks we&apos;ve got art all wrong. He doesn&apos;t like the way museums are organised and finds the usual little wall labels, with their dates and movements and snippets of art history, unhelpful. Ideally, he envisages museums reorganised according to therapeutic functions \u2013 with a basement of suffering, leading upwards to a gallery of self-knowledge on the top floor. It&apos;s like Dante&apos;s circles of hell. De Botton&apos;s evangelising and his huckster&apos;s sincerity make him the least congenial gallery guide imaginable. He has no eye, and no ear for language. With their smarmy sermons and symptomology of human failings, their aphorisms about art leading us to better parts of ourselves, De Botton&apos;s texts feel like being doorstepped. But art contains concentrated doses of the virtues! You could coerce any art at all into his cause of mental hygiene and spiritual wellbeing. De Botton reduces art to its discernible content. He doesn&apos;t make us want to look at all. Until 7 September. Details: +31 20 674 7000.

The shelves are filled with paraphernalia such as pipes and bongs used for smoking cannabis, alongside the scales and &quot;stench-proof&quot; plastic bags popular with dealers. Behind the counter are sachets offering luridly packaged packets of Amsterdam Gold, Herbal Bush and Mayan Dream. These are among 70-odd synthetic versions of cannabis to have cropped up in recent years. They are significantly more dangerous than natural cannabis, stronger and with far higher rates of hospitalisation; they have even been linked to the deaths of young users. Aficionados find them less enjoyable, according to research. Yet they typify how the market for legal highs is booming, accelerated by the absurdity of prohibition in a globalised world. Politicians have learned nothing from the futility of their fight against conventional drugs \u2013 an abject failure that pours gold into the pockets of the globe&apos;s most vicious gangsters. So MEPs have just backed new rules cutting from two years to 10 months the time taken to assess and ban new psychoactive products. Britain, which has outlawed scores of new substances, believes Brussels is too weak; it wants to wriggle out of the European regulatory regime while a working party examines tougher controls. But these new substances \u2013 which include stimulants and psychedelics also \u2013 are made on an industrial scale in Asia, and are often sold online: so much easier for enthusiasts than chasing after dealers on street corners. They are found also at convenience stores and petrol stations. As soon as one is banned, chemists simply tweak the recipe and sell a slightly different product. The United Nations estimates that there are more than 250 legal highs on sale; experts in Europe say new substances arrive on the market at the rate of more than one each week. These products must be marked as &quot;not for human consumption&quot; \u2013 but surveys suggest that one in 10 young Britons try them each year. The fact that they are on sale in shops implies they are safe. Yet when sold as &quot;plant food&quot; or &quot;research chemicals&quot;, they come with no information on dosages or harm reduction, let alone any adequate controls over contents or buyers. Sometimes they contain prohibited substances. The result is a rising number of fatalities alongside rising usage, seemingly filling the gap as the popularity of conventional drugs such as cocaine and heroin wanes. There were 29 reported deaths linked to legal highs in 2011, but nearly twice that number the following year. In Scotland alone, they were discovered during toxicology reports into 36 deaths. Meanwhile, doctors report rising levels of related health issues including heart attacks, kidney failure, seizures and mental health problems. These are the victims of a new front in the deluded war on drugs. Once again, while myopic politicians preach tired sermons pioneered by President Richard Nixon about defeating the scourge of narcotics, there is a safer and more sensible alternative if only they displayed a little courage. Look at New Zealand, a country whose isolation from the main drug supply routes led to high prices for heroin, cocaine and ecstasy. So when legal highs arrived on the scene, a thriving market quickly emerged for everything from crystal meth to synthetic cannabinoids and cocaine. Eventually progressive politicians decided to regulate the market rather than rely on criminals to control this new trade; only one MP ended up opposing the move. Under a law passed last summer, synthetic recreational drugs can be sold after tests to determine safety \u2013 funded by manufacturers, and then only at licensed shops to adults. No advertising or promotion is permitted. Peter Dunne, the health minister and unlikely architect of the measure, has just revealed the number of outlets selling legal highs has fallen from 4,000 to little more than 150, while the number of products available has plunged, from 300 to 41. The risks, of course, have been reduced just as dramatically. The legal highs debate shows how utterly wrong opponents of drug reform are once again. As Dunne says, this is about protecting citizens, not approving drugs. The issue is merely one of implementing policies that are realistic and responsible. That is surely one dream worth chasing.

England and Germany are also bidding for one of the 12 hosting packages of three group-stage matches in the 24-team tournament, plus a single knockout match from the last-16 or quarter-finals rounds.

The Mercury prize-nominated band Friendly Fires were on stage, but the crowd were chatting, or gazing into their smartphones: &quot;I turned to my friends and said, &apos;There has got to be a better way&apos;.&quot; Four years on, Sofar Sounds, his company, is part of a new movement bringing big-name musicians into people&apos;s living rooms. The concept of &quot;private gigs&quot; turns out to be as popular with bands as it is with fans and business is booming in London, Los Angeles and New York. Sofar \u2013 Songs From A Room \u2013 sets up free, intimate and unplugged gigs by emerging artists. A key added element of secrecy comes from the fact that the venue is revealed only a couple of hours before the show. Invitations are sent out to those who sign up to a mailing list. &quot;It&apos;s growing faster than we ever imagined. In just three years we&apos;ve grown to over 60 gigs a month across 70 cities,&quot; said Offer. &quot;We pick acts from every genre, so you never know if you&apos;ll get an indie band, a beat boxer or even an opera singer.&quot; For the guests the aim is to catch a band early in its career. &quot;Bastille have played a couple of times, the National played at an event in Washington DC and the Staves played in Belsize Park a couple of years ago.&quot; Sofar Sounds now hosts shows from Amsterdam to Mumbai. Even small domestic spaces fit the bill and anyone keen to host a show can nominate their own lounge. On Friday night, the indie trio and Island Records signing We Were Evergreen played to 75 people in an arty flat in Paris. Another 350 people applied for a ticket but could not make it in. The London craze for homely gigs has started an international &quot;pop-up wave of events&quot;, now encompassing, cinema, music and food. Operating on a similar basis is the company Secret Concerts, which works in collaboration with the recording label UntiedArtists. Like Sofar, they ask for donations from their guests and went into business, they say, because: &quot;The most satisfying gigs are those where an intimate environment, a committed audience and a great performance combine to create a charged atmosphere.&quot; In London, Sofar gets an average of 2,000 requests for each gig. &quot;We only let about 50 or 60 in so we have a questionnaire and that helps us decide. It&apos;s very exclusive \u2013 but only because the room&apos;s small,&quot; explained Offer. &quot;We like an intimate environment. The person sitting next to you on the floor could be the person singing. We try and make sure everybody gets to come, but we do try to have a creative audience.&quot; Kaye Godleman, a television director and producer from London, offered up her home for a gig after seeing a direct request on a mailing list from a favourite artist, Canadian singer-songwriter Jane Siberry.

Some festival organisers are looking at new, odd locations and one , Freerotation, is already invite-only. Others, including Farr festival and Gottwood, are now advertised as &apos;hidden in the woods&apos;.

A day I won&apos;t forget. I felt a heaviness lift from my shoulders and, in the blink of an eye, my life fully opening up again. We\u2019ve been separated a long time. The journey that ended in divorce was one of the most difficult and painful experiences of my life.I\u2019ve never failed at anything in my life and I was raised to believe marriage is for life, so there was no way I was going to give up on mine without doing everything I could to make it work. I worked out why it took me so long to leave. I was simply unwilling to give up. I stopped recognising the man I loved during the time we were together, my ego and the love I felt for him prevented me from swallowing this painful truth and moving on. My ex husband was too busy keeping up appearances and telling me divorce wasn\u2019t part of his Arab culture and that if I, as a British Muslim found it acceptable to end a marriage it was because I was westernised. But it was the men, the wonderful gentle, kind Muslim men in my life who finally made me admit that enough was enough. They made me acknowledge that I was the only one who could claw my life back, I owe them my sanity and wellbeing. My father called me during one particularly bad day and read me the riot act - either I walk away and leave my husband or he had no choice but to cut me off, disown me. My brothers applied some tough love as only brothers can and ordered me to get a grip on myself and to move out. One of my most treasured friends in Khartoum spent months on Skype patiently helping me understand how I had lost all of sense of who I was. He was the first person I confided in about my marriage collapsing when I was on a train from Glasgow to Oxford and he popped up online to ask how I was. I found myself sobbing my heart out as I tapped away on my laptop telling him I had reached the tipping point. And finally a very wise and gentle man, an imam from Algeria, never once told me that it was my duty as a Muslim woman to put up with abusive behaviour. He told me the opposite, that I needed to get healthier in order to make a good decision about my future. He helped me to regain my confidence, to love myself again and reminded me over and over how sacred the bond of marriage is in Islam. How Islam guides us to treat our spouse with supreme kindness and love and if we are unable too, then they must leave them with respect and kindness. I found solice in my faith and took practical steps to recover, mentally and physically. I started writing and performing stand up comedy across the UK, I appeared at the Hong Kong comedy festival. I reflected on my experiences of being in a mixed race marriage, the racism and issues that arise from it and all the assumptions people make without knowing a single thing about me. After I left my ex husband I found a job, I moved to Amsterdam and then on to Pakistan where I now live and work. It wasn\u2019t easy but by isolating myself I found it easier to process everything. It also meant I could avoid the cultural baggage still attached to divorce in the British Pakistani and Pakistani communities.  My family sheltered me from the worst of the fallout and gossip. Now I\u2019m back in the UK for a few months. I feel like myself again. I feel more balanced, calmer and at peace with myself, able to cope with the snide and judgemental comments from the more traditional members of my so-called community. I\u2019ve been back in Oxford almost three months and I\u2019m truly stunned by the worst aspects of Pakistani culture and how its rammed down throats.  Recently a British-born Pakistani relative came to visit my parents. The man has himself been divorced, more than once, yet he he seemed to see an opportunity to assert his authority as he kept digging away at me. Other British-born Pakistani relatives, many younger than me, have similar tactics. One repeats over and over how I should reflect on how I had \u201cended up in this predicament\u201d and added that he felt the reason was there was \u201cvery little feminine about you\u201d. I\u2019m \u201ctoo vocal and don\u2019t know how to behave\u201d. Another one chimed in: \u201cI feel sorry for you. But you are not not exactly a typical Pakistani woman and this is something you need to think about.\u201d Another: \u201cIts best people don\u2019t know about you being divorced, we don\u2019t want your father to feel embarrassed.\u201d At first I argued with these men, then I decided I had better things to do \u2013 like live my life in the most honest, respectful and thoughtful way I can. My experience are not unique. My friend\u2019s sister has been divorced for years yet nobody in their extended family knows. Another friend felt she had to flee abroad when she left her abusive marriage.  Divorced is permitted in Islam to protect men and women from a marriage where either party are denied their rights. It safeguards dignity and needs. Nobody should be forced to carry a cultural burden of shame. @shaistaaziz", "sentences": ["After I left my ex husband I found a job, I moved to Amsterdam and then on to Pakistan where I now live and work."], "title": "The kindness of the Muslim men who helped me leave behind my miserable marriage", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/she-said/2014/apr/27/the-kindness-of-the-muslim-men-who-helped-me-leave-behind-my-miserable-marriage", "tags": ["Women", "Divorce", "Marriage", "Islam", "Pakistan"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-04-27T23:01:00Z", "article": "  Dismissed by some as tomorrow&apos;s chip paper but indispensable to others as a first draft of history, nearly 400 years of newspapers will be available for perusal on Monday in the British Library&apos;s new \u00a333m reading room. The Newsroom, offering more than 750m pages of newspapers and magazines and 4.8m archived websites, will be officially opened by the culture secretary, Sajid Javid. A hi-tech reading room, the first at the British Library in St Pancras for more than 10 years, offers researchers free access to microfilm and digital newspaper collections dating back to the English civil war. Together with a purpose-built robotic storage facility in Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, it replaces the Colindale newspaper library in north London, which closed last November. The collection&apos;s oldest English-language newspaper title was published in Amsterdam in 1620 and covered news from Italy, Germany and Bohemia. The title, A Corrant out of Italy, Germany, etc, is still used by some newspapers including the Hexham Courant in Northumberland. The reading room&apos;s oldest still surviving newspaper is the Stamford Mercury, first published in 1713,though the earliest issue held by the British Library is from 22 May 1718 \u2013 earlier editions are available in facsimile form. It is still published today as the Rutland &amp; Stamford Mercury. The collection faced its greatest threat during the blitz. A direct hit on the library at Colindale resulted in the loss of 9,000 volumes of newspapers. Today, volumes still turn up during the continuing programme to digitise work that contains lumps of shrapnel. It includes everything from every issue of the News of the World, to Oswald Mosley&apos;s newspaper, The Blackshirt, published during the 1930s. Such a wealth of material is regularly drawn on by authors, including Kate Summerscale, who researched her best-selling The Suspicions of Mr Whicher using the collection, and novelist Jake Arnott, who used it when writing The Long Firm to get a better feel for the 1960s setting of the novel. The British Library chief executive, Roly Keating, said: &quot;Newspapers are often described as the first draft of history \u2013 in fact, in many cases they are the raw material of history and very often the only record that exists of an event or an individual that otherwise would have been forgotten. The British Library&apos;s newspaper collection is a vital part of the memory of the nation \u2013 recording every aspect of local, regional and national life, and continuing to grow at a rate of more than seven metres every week. &quot;The opening of the Newsroom means that news and newspapers are no longer the Cinderella of the library&apos;s collections, but are now at the very heart of the British Library&apos;s offering to researchers. By moving the collection out of Colindale and into the world-class storage facility at Boston Spa, we&apos;re ensuring this vast, precious and incredibly fragile resource is available not just for today&apos;s researchers, but also future generations.&quot; There are 40 digital microfilm viewers, 7.8m scanned pages of historic newspapers and more than 40,000 TV and radio news programmes, increasing at a rate of 60 hours every day across 22 news channels. The fragile print collection&apos;s new West Yorkshire home is temperature- and humidity-controlled so that the 60m issues of newspapers, most of which were produced on cheap, low-quality paper that was meant to be read once then thrown away, may stand a chance of lasting well into the future. The facility, which is also a low-oxygen environment to cut the risk of fire, is off limits to people to help maintain the atmosphere. The newspapers are stored in 20 metre high racks and fetched by robotic cranes that deliver them, via an airlock, to a staffed retrieval area. When there is no digital or microfilm version of a newspaper, the aim is for print newspapers to be delivered to the St Pancras newsroom within 48 hours. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2014.

Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s side will need a victory here to stay ahead of their rivals, but look to be facing obliging opponents: a Newcastle United side who have lost their last five games, scoring just once in that time. Gwilym Mumford Vets In The Disaster Zone9pm, BBC2 Michael Mosley travels to the Philippines to observe a team of disaster-specialist vets as they help to salvage the animal life that survived last year&apos;s Typhoon Haiyan. A third of the population relies exclusively on farming, making animals valuable commodities. Under the cover of financial rescue the vets also take advantage of an opportunity to instil some progressive ideas about animal welfare \u2013 building enclosures that are roomy and self-sanitising in place of the cramped iron and concrete pens destroyed by the storm. Rachel Aroesti Prey9pm, ITV Cop John Simm is remanded in custody after a murder, but escapes when his prison van crashes. He grabs his chance and runs, determined to prove his innocence. Susan (the superb Rosie Cavaliero) is assigned to the investigation but her backstory prejudices her judgment. So much isn&apos;t said because it doesn&apos;t need to be. If this really is writer Chris Lunt&apos;s first TV gig, he&apos;s an astonishing talent. Perhaps emboldened by Broadchurch, ITV is trying something new here and it&apos;s brilliant.

First up, DCI Tom Mathias (Richard Harrington) \u2013 an ex-Met copper relocated to Aberystwyth \u2013 investigates the disappearance of 64-year-old Helen Jenkins, the former head of a children&apos;s home located at the ominously monikered Devil&apos;s Bridge.

Jonathan Wright My Brother The Terrorist9pm, BBC3 In 2011&apos;s My Brother The Islamist, Robb Leech&apos;s subject was his stepbrother Rich, a recent convert to Islam. It painted a portrait of a man revelling in religious superiority, but never quite established why Rich had so violently rejected the society he&apos;d grown up in, or why Islam was the form that rejection took. Now that his stepbrother is a convicted terrorist serving a six-year jail sentence, Robb gets back behind the camera to explore what happened and speak to the radical preacher who converted him. RA Game Of Thrones9pm, Sky Atlantic Game Of Thrones loves a morally ambiguous character, and has perhaps crafted TV&apos;s finest example in Jaime Lannister, a man who pushed a child out of a window in the show&apos;s first episode and yet has since seemed oddly likable. Whether that remains the case after that deeply controversial sexual encounter with sister Cersei last week remains to be seen, but we should get further indication of his good/bad status here, as he hands Brienne a task. Elsewhere, Jon Snow forms a team of volunteers as the Wildlings approach. GM Rev10pm, BBC2 Dark days for the remaining St Saviour in the Marshes parishioners as the church doors close for the final time, leaving Adam without a job. Despite his slipshod attempts to keep the balance sheets in check, he sets his sights on a career in managerial consulting.

Jacob is a boy in his late teens who lives with his grandmother in England. His grandmother has some unknown relation with a Danish family who live in Amsterdam. When the chance arises for Jacob to be able to go to Amsterdam, he grabs it with both hands and boards a plane. It is also apparent that Jacob is fascinated with Anne Frank who of course has many connections with the city he is about to visit. Jacob feels as though he is protective of Anne Frank as he has read her diary many times - which for Jacob feels as though it is a very personal thing- as though Anne is confiding in him only. Of course, Jacob is not ignorant enough to believe that it is true. Within the story, the city of Amsterdam gets frequently described as a spider&apos;s web - very intricate and dangerous, although beautiful all the same. In the book, Amsterdam gets portrayed as a very diverse city in which a diverse community flowers under the eyes of the spider coherently glancing at each component of the city. Within the book, all sorts of matters of opinion are grazed over: homosexuality, euthanasia, bisexuality, long distance relationships and transvestism.  One of the first characters that Jacob stumbles across (by chance) is called Ton. Ton is a strongly recognisable character throughout the book - always appearing at odd chances and situations. From the back, long hair flows down a scarcely covered back. The movement is slow, precise and seductive - much like that of a cat searching for prey within the night. Eyes flitting through endless amounts of people in the crowded bar. Focusing on one particular young gentleman who is appearing to look blatantly English. Ton in Dutch is Tony... Another character in the book who I found fascinating was Geertrui. She tells the story of her life when she was younger when World War Two was raging and corrupting her home and all those she loved. Although, Geertrui survives the war and lives just outside of Amsterdam in a hospital bed. In the book she is described as bird-like and frail although she has eyes in her head that are as strong or even stronger than a champion heavy-weight&apos;s. Geertrui decides that she wants to end her life in the most peaceful way as possible by asking to be given a drug that will send her to sleep and then being given a second drug that will stop her heart beating for good. The date has been decided and the family that will be present has been arranged. Two stories are being told within the book. One through the eyes of Jacob and the other story being told by Geertrui when she was younger. Jacob is discovering life within Amsterdam and Geertrui is sacrificing and growing up in a brutal world of war and tears.  This book instantly made me want to go to Amsterdam with it containing rich description and lively culture. One thing that I really like about this book is that there were lots of complex emotions and characters within the book which made it slightly difficult to keep up but I&apos;m sure that many of you will manage it! Initially, I thought that it would be difficult to relate to the main character, Jacob, with him being a boy. Usually, I try to avoid books with boys as main characters because I feel as though the author has to have a very good understanding of both their character and the potential audience in order to be able to pull it off. Chambers manages it beautifully and there was not one moment in which I felt that I could not understand Jacob&apos;s feelings. In fact, it has encouraged me to read more books with the main characters who are boys... thank you Aiden Chambers!  All of the characters in this book fascinated me because all of the characters were mostly in the same situations in both past and present; most interesting was how most of the characters reacted to the situations in the same way. I really enjoyed the richly diverse characters in this book. I loved not only the diverse characters, but the diverse situations in which this &apos;normal&apos; English boy got thrown into, some of them very controversial. Some parts of the book were devastatingly sad with characters dying etc, etc... However, I think that this is partly a good thing because it shows that the relationships with the characters are strong and that is something that an author has to build up to show the reader. One thing that I was not expecting was that the connections with World War Two were not that strong and I didn&apos;t feel that it was really based around battle at all or the suffering that the Nazis caused innocent people. Then again, I was happy about this because war stories aren&apos;t really my thing but I thought that the theme of war and devastation in the background of the story was something that added grit for the story to develop. I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn&apos;t mind a bit of an emotionally challenging read, and who likes a bit of romance, gritty descriptions and is (obviously) looking for a good book.

Tottenham have monitored De Boer since last December, when they sacked Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas and replaced him with Tim Sherwood who, in turn, is not expected to stay beyond the summer, and it has emerged that they have now made an official approach to the Ajax director of football, Marc Overmars. Spurs made a move for De Boer during the Dutch league&apos;s winter break only for the 43-year-old to make it clear that his future lay at Ajax. Tottenham had made Louis van Gaal their No1 target to replace Sherwood in the summer and they had been encouraged in their pursuit of the Holland manager.

De Boer, who is contracted to Ajax until 2017, had always said that he wanted to remain at the Amsterdam club for many years. He is approaching the end of his fourth season as manager and has just secured a fourth consecutive league title. It had been thought that when he did decide to leave, it would be to push for a move to Barcelona, for whom he also played, or a club of a similar stature. But De Boer&apos;s comments to the media in Holland this week represent a change of tack. &quot;When Tottenham are coming, I want to listen, after 3 May, to what they have to say,&quot; De Boer said, referring to the date of their last game of the season, at home to NEC Nijmegen on Saturday. &quot;It is clear that they have to have good plans. I would not leave Ajax for nothing. But Spurs are a club that I feel good about. They play good football. &quot;They have made their interest clear to Marc Overmars and, after the last match, I am going to think about this possibility. I am going to talk and listen and, after that, I will let my feelings speak.&quot; Ajax have not been immune to criticism this season, despite winning the title and their supporters were furious at the 5-1 cup final thrashing at the hands of unfancied Zwolle. De Boer might wonder what more there is to achieve at the club, beyond winning titles and mere Champions League survival, and there is the perennial frustration of seeing leading players sold. De Boer has spoken to the Tottenham players, Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen, whom he previously managed at Ajax, about life at White Hart Lane and he says that he is attracted by the notion of building a project. &quot;I want to add something to a club, something which people can say: &apos;That&apos;s the hand of Frank De Boer,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;Liverpool is a nice example of that, with what Brendan Rodgers is doing right now.&quot; Sherwood is under contract until 2015 and he has made no secret of his frustration at how Tottenham are actively pursuing his replacement. He has complained about how &quot;the silence is deafening&quot; at boardroom level with regard to any declarations of support for him. With the club on course to finish the season with 72 points, which would equal a Premier League record for them, he believes that he deserves the chance to continue in the role.", "sentences": ["De Boer, who is contracted to Ajax until 2017, had always said that he wanted to remain at the Amsterdam club for many years."], "title": "Frank de Boer keen for Tottenham talks after Spurs approach Ajax", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/29/ronald-de-boer-tottenham-approach-ajax-manager", "tags": ["Tottenham Hotspur", "Ajax", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-01T08:11:48Z", "article": "Miley Cyrus has postponed the first two dates of her European tour, citing ongoing complications from a recent sinus infection.

He saw. He went home.&quot; So ran the tag-line of the Irish box office smash hit comedy I, Keano, an epic musical melodrama about a Roman legion preparing for war. It was inspired by a real-life melodrama of even more epic proportions: arguably the most fractious falling-out in the history of Irish sport, a gripping and often amusing controversy prompted by Roy Keane&apos;s contentious departure from the Republic of Ireland World Cup squad in 2002. The captain&apos;s headline-grabbing exit from the squad briefly transformed the tiny western Pacific island of Saipan into the most famous places on Earth. It made a cute and goofy Labrador puppy named Triggs into a household name. It was the source of more pompous pontification in the bars of the British Isles than any number of budgets, general elections and scandals. It practically sundered a nation, driving it to the brink of something approaching civil war and prompted the Taoiseach (prime minister) of the day to offer his services as a mediator. It became the subject of more hand-wringing sanctimony and general tomfoolery than almost any incident before or since in modern Irish life. It was all about standards. Roy&apos;s standards. Depending on your point of view they were either too high or not high enough. Was Roy the perfectionist who wanted the best for his country or the traitor who abandoned it? In Ireland, 12 years on, the jury remains out.     Roy Keane was the only subject that mattered in Ireland in the summer of 2002. Photograph: Haydn West/PA    Everybody and nobody seems to know exactly what happened. The definitive version remains unconfirmed and even now, those who were privy to events as they unravelled remain understandably reluctant to talk about them in too much depth. Keane&apos;s detractors claim he walked. His supporters insist he was sent home. The truth seems to lie somewhere in between: he made his position untenable and forced his manager&apos;s hand. This much we know: Ireland&apos;s captain, then a 30-year-old volatile driving force who had almost single-handedly dragged his country through qualification for Japan and South Korea 2002 out of a group containing Portugal and Holland, decided to leave the camp out of frustration at poor preparation but then changed his mind. However, a newspaper interview he&apos;d given to the Irish Times rolled off the presses like a grenade and exploded, prompting the famous showdown at which Keane embarked on a character assassination of his manager, Mick McCarthy, that was so brutal, the object of his scorn felt compelled to say he could no longer work with his captain. In a chat with me for the Irish magazine Hot Press a few months after the event, the former Republic of Ireland international Niall Quinn insisted that &quot;Roy walked out&quot;. Later in the same interview he stressed that Keane had walked out &quot;twice in three days&quot;. He could not have been more clear: &quot;You must remember that,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re not talking about a happy bunny here, who suddenly said the wrong things for a few seconds. I think it built up and up in him. While the rest of us were prepared to get on with things, knowing how ramshackle things are, he allowed it to get in the way of his World Cup.&quot;     Roy Keane speaks to reporters before leaving Saipan on a flight home. Photograph:    Kieran Doherty / Reuters/Reuters    Keane tells it differently, stating in his autobiography that having originally become so exasperated by a rock-hard training pitch, the FAI&apos;s failure to get their squad&apos;s training kit to Saipan and a row about five-a-side goalkeeping arrangements, he decided to throw his hat at the whole jamboree and go home. A short time later, having been given time to cool down and review his position, he subsequently changed his mind only to be, in his opinion, ambushed at a team meeting called by McCarthy, who accused him of having faked an injury to avoid having to play the second leg of Ireland&apos;s successful qualifying play-off against Iran. That, according to Keane, was the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back and the cue for his outburst, which Quinn described as &quot;the most surgical slaughtering anyone has ever got&quot;. &quot;You&apos;re a fucking wanker. I didn&apos;t rate you as a player, I don&apos;t rate you as a manager and I don&apos;t rate you as a person. You&apos;re a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. I&apos;ve got no respect for you. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks.&quot;     Roy Keane keeps busy by walking his dog Triggs. Photograph: Reuters    &quot;Humiliation in front of the whole party was the result he was seeking,&quot; wrote Keane of McCarthy in his autobiography, stating that the meeting had been a set-up. Not too long after that, Keane received a phone call from his representative, the Irish solicitor Michael Kennedy. &quot;You&apos;ve been kicked out,&quot; he was told. At 6pm the next day, with the rest of the Republic of Ireland squad en route to Japan, Keane was on the next plane home. How had it come to this? Since his days as a youth footballer making a name for himself in Cork, Keane had never had much time for the FAI, an organisation that favoured players from Dublin clubs to those from elsewhere in the country. Upon becoming a senior international, he was increasingly perplexed by its amateurish approach to match preparation and was not alone, as a cursory flick through the autobiographies of any Republic of Ireland international who played through the Jack Charlton and Mick McCarthy eras will prove. Things began to go pear-shaped at the airport on the way to Saipan. Already annoyed that he had been criticised in some newspapers for missing Quinn&apos;s famously generous fundraising testimonial in Sunderland in favour of remaining in Manchester for treatment on a number of injuries that were threatening to rule him out of the World Cup, Keane was in understandably grumpy mood at Dublin airport and immediately buttonholed a couple of the journalists who had portrayed his non-attendance as a &quot;snub&quot;. The journey to Saipan had started badly and went quickly downhill. &quot;The trip is a shambles from the beginning,&quot; recalls Keane in his book. &quot;Dublin airport is packed, you can&apos;t move. We hump a month&apos;s luggage through the main concourse. Check ourselves in. We&apos;re travelling KLM, going the scenic route, via Amsterdam and Tokyo. Fans, journalists, players, officials all mingle together. The package tour image comes to mind again. Amid the chaos, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, arrives to give us a send-off.&quot; With Keane already seething, it was left to Hollywood actor Will Smith to make things worse. On the flight to Tokyo, Ireland&apos;s captain killed time watching Smith&apos;s portrayal of Muhammad Ali and was transfixed by the scene in which the boxer resists the urgings of his family, friends and advisers to accept the draft for the Vietnam war. &quot;They&apos;re all urging him to give in,&quot; recalls Keane. &quot;Take the draft. You won&apos;t have to fight. Just go through the motions, play the game, screw the things you believe in. Ali resists them all. I&apos;m doing what I think is right. It matters. You don&apos;t compromise on your principles. Watching this is very moving. I hadn&apos;t known this about Ali. Something in this scene strikes a chord with me. Don&apos;t put up with shit. I&apos;m not fighting a white man&apos;s war. It&apos;s an inspiring notion, a demonstration of conviction that I understand very clearly and I relate to my own life. Don&apos;t compromise the things you believe in.&quot; Nice one, Will. Emboldened by what he had seen on his flight to Tokyo, Keane was unimpressed when Ireland&apos;s squad eventually arrived in Saipan for what was ostensibly a week of pre-World Cup relaxation with some light training, only to discover their hampers of training kit, footballs and medical supplies had not arrived on the island. It was his nightmare scenario: Ireland preparing for a tournament in what he described as &quot;happy-camper mode with no real ambition, settling for second best&quot;. Visiting McCarthy in his hotel room, he voiced his disquiet and told his manager the team&apos;s gear should have arrived the previous week. The following morning, Monday, Ireland&apos;s players arrived at their training ground for a run to discover the surface was too hard. &quot;We could have watered it,&quot; Fifa&apos;s liaison officer told Keane. &quot;If anyone had told us you were coming down.&quot; Fail to prepare, prepare to fail. Things went from bad to worse. The missing equipment arrived that night and the following day the squad had a full training session on a pitch that was still too hard, apart from one section, which had been flooded by those responsible for watering the pitch. When the training session finished with a game, Keane was outraged to discover the squad&apos;s goalkeepers were unwilling to play on the grounds that they were too tired, having begun training half an hour before everyone else. In front of a couple of journalists, he got in a heated argument with the reserve goalkeeper Alan Kelly, one of the players in the squad he rubbed along with better than most. With Lee Carsley and Steve Finnan having picked up injuries on the training pitch, Keane decided he&apos;d had enough of Ireland&apos;s &quot;third world approach to the game&quot; and upon returning to the team hotel, he took McCarthy to one side and announced he wanted to go home. The way Keane tells it, he subsequently apologised to Kelly for the row they&apos;d had, went for a walk and was persuaded to stay on by team physio, concierge and agony uncle Mick Byrne. Upon being informed of the U-turn, McCarthy told Keane he&apos;d already asked the Celtic midfielder Colin Healy to come out as his replacement. Feeling bad for Healy, Keane left it up to McCarthy to decide what should happen next. &quot;I was indecisive,&quot; recalls Keane. &quot;I desperately wanted to play. Yet I couldn&apos;t stand the fuck-ups. There is no hero here.&quot; The indecision continued: Keane told Byrne he was definitely going, secretly hoping he&apos;d be invited to stay. With the news of his imminent departure breaking in Ireland, he spoke on the phone to his adviser Kennedy, then Alex Ferguson. His Manchester United manager told him he had earned the right to change his mind and remain in Saipan. With mere minutes to go before the Republic of Ireland were due to fax their World Cup squad to Fifa, Keane decided to stay and a potential crisis appeared to have been nipped in the bud. Determined to keep his head down and his mouth shut until the squad moved to their proper training camp on the mainland, Keane did exactly that \u2026 apart from honouring promises to give a couple of interviews to favoured journalists, one of which appeared in the Irish Times the day before the Irish squad were due to leave the island.. What could possibly go wrong? &quot;It expressed exactly what I felt,&quot; said Keane of the interview in his book. &quot;I believed the people at home had a right to know the truth. The Irish fans are celebrated for the support they give the team. Thousands of them were flying out on expensive packages to support us in the World Cup. My own brothers and cousin were coming. It was the trip of a lifetime for them. Millions more would be watching the matches at home, as I&apos;d done in 1998 and 1990. Were the people to be treated like mugs? They spent their hard-earned money, paid our wages and then we insult them with PR crap about all they&apos;ve done for us. Maybe we should do something for them to repay the debt we owed them. Like get our act together. And tell them the score now and then.&quot; The end was nigh. The interview caused a sensation in both Ireland and Saipan, prompting the team meeting which resulted in Keane&apos;s exile from the squad. At a hastily convened press conference, McCarthy confirmed the news of Keane&apos;s departure flanked by his new captain Steve Staunton, along with Kelly and Quinn in a show of solidarity. Upstairs in his room, Keane bade farewell to a procession of largely sympathetic team-mates at the door of his hotel room. His World Cup jig was very much up. Months later, Quinn expressed his regret at the manner in which events had unfolded. &quot;When Roy exploded like he did, we needed to have a 24-hour cooling off period,&quot; he told me. &quot;Looking back, I think the events of history would have been a lot different if we had done that. Roy walked out, Mick called a press conference and it seems like minutes later myself, Stan and Alan Kelly are in there with Stan [Steve Staunton] as the new captain. Obviously, at the time we were shocked by what Roy had done, but Mick had asked us to stick up for him because he knew there&apos;d be a hostile reception waiting for him. We knew we were putting ourselves in a dreadful position but we walked in with no other choice at the time. There was no way Roy was going to walk in and apologise a minute later, it was too intense for that. But at the same time, we might have prepared ourselves and structured ourselves for what was going to happen a little bit better. After that, I could give you a list of 20 other mistakes we made, all horrendous stuff. I&apos;m almost apologetic for the mistakes we made. I&apos;m certainly apologetic for the mistakes I made.&quot; Appearing at the press conference alongside McCarthy, Kelly and Staunton appears to have been Quinn&apos;s biggest mistake, as Keane saw it as an outright act of betrayal. Wounded at having been accused of disloyalty by McCarthy for feigning injury, he was outraged that none of his team-mates, particularly the more senior ones for whom Japan and South Korea represented a last international hurrah, had not spoken out on his behalf when McCarthy rounded on him. Having made his own travel arrangements with help from staff at Manchester United, he went home to a house under siege from reporters. Several daily dog-walks with Triggs around Cheshire later, with Ireland&apos;s World Cup opener against Cameroon looming, he granted an interview to RTE news reporter Tommie Gorman, who spoke of Keane&apos;s role model status, all but berated him for his use of industrial language at a private team meeting attended by grown men, pleaded with him to think of Ireland&apos;s children and urged him to reconsider his position. With the Irish football press pack listening in from Japan, courtesy of one of their relatives holding a phone up against a television in Dublin, the entire fiasco had officially entered the realms of high farce. &quot;If for one second I thought &apos;Maybe Roy, you were a little bit out of order, maybe there&apos;s a way back&apos;, I&apos;d be back on that flight,&quot; said Keane to Gorman. &quot;No doubts in my mind about that. But I went to my room and we had three players in a press conference within 20 minutes or half an hour of [the team meeting] saying they were behind Mick. People look at them as role models; they&apos;re cowards. If I went back I couldn&apos;t give 100% for my country. When they had their chance to speak up they didn&apos;t.&quot; Clearly bemused by a decidedly melodramatic interrogatory style in which Gorman pointed out that people in Ireland would be &quot;absolutely haunted&quot; by his departure from the squad, Keane was typically blunt. &quot;That&apos;ll pass,&quot; he said. &quot;People will get on with their lives. It&apos;s a football tournament.&quot; He was spot on. It did pass and most people did get on with their lives, but at the time in Ireland, such steely-eyed pragmatism went strangely unappreciated.", "sentences": ["We&apos;re travelling KLM, going the scenic route, via Amsterdam and Tokyo."], "title": "World Cup: 25 stunning moments ...

Compiled by local families and owners, it&apos;s a personal black book of suggestions and advice. Being keen on cycling, art and on a location reachable by train, we chose Amsterdam, and stayed in a beautiful wooden-floored property on Wouwermanstraat, a few minutes&apos; walk, even at toddler pace, from the Rijksmuseum and leafy Vondelpark. That said, the array of toys in the basement playroom \u2013 and there are no toys better than the toys of another child \u2013 meant it was sometimes hard to drag our two out. The five-year-old was glued to the indoor swing, a design extravagence made all the more indulgent by the lengthy diversions it allowed for us to relax in the stylish living room. The owners had left not only a couple of city guides, but a hand-drawn map of the cafe-rich local area, Amsterdam-Zuid, picking out their own favourite things to do and eat: apple pie and playgrounds featured heavily. They&apos;d also left a note on the well-stocked fridge telling us to help ourselves. Given that the property has two king-size beds, two cots and a child&apos;s bed, two families could easily stay here easily and split the (admittedly hefty) cost. Along with their iBook, the owners also provided details of trustworthy babysitters, and responded instantly to a query about vegetarian restaurants nearby.     Children's bedroom in Wouwermanstraat    They also left us the use of their cargo bike. Cyclists, of course, rule in Amsterdam, and a new cycle lane runs through the middle of the Rijksmuseum. Rembrandt&apos;s The Night Watch had a helpfully soporific effect on the toddler, and the other galleries there \u2013 particularly the 17th-century dolls&apos; houses \u2013 held our five-year-old&apos;s interest for a while, as did the Stedelijk modern art museum. Amsterdam also provides the perfect diet for a growing child.

It suggests that he may not be at one with himself. After all, to talk of one or oneself is both authoritative and yet oddly distancing. When Soleymanlou \u2013 born in Iran in the early 1980s, and raised in Paris and Toronto \u2013 told his mother that he was writing a show exploring his confusions over who he was and where he fitted in the world, she asked whether other people would find it interesting. It&apos;s a question the audience may also ask of a highly personal, low-key show that&apos;s a bit like one of those dot-to-dot drawings before it&apos;s been joined up. At its heart is Soleymanlou&apos;s relationship with the country of his birth. He speaks Farsi but cannot read or write it. He bought a book about Persian culture, but only got as far as reading the back cover. He feels both connected and disconnected: he watches footage of young people of his own age out on the street risking their lives and protesting against the rigged election result of 2009 from a place of safety. He is with them, but can never be of them. From his position of affluence and privilege, he can never really be at one with them.

But we are fascinated to hear what you make of the 10 shortlisted contenders detailed below. Check out their websites and Facebook pages as well as the App Store and Google Play to find out more. According to John Rossant, chairman of the New Cities Foundation and another of the competition\u2019s judges: \u201cThis year\u2019s line-up demonstrates how mobile apps are enhancing many aspects of city life, whether it\u2019s solving transport challenges, encouraging collaboration within communities, promoting creativity or bringing citizens closer to authorities.\u201d Community collaboration is, indeed, much in evidence among the shortlisted entries. RipeNearMe from Adelaide in Australia, for example, maps edible plants growing on public land and food being grown by citizens, so that users can locate, share, swap and sell produce. They can even ask for notification when a tree or plant becomes ripe ... Peerby, from Amsterdam, encourages neighbours to share items with each other via their mobile phones. When users post something they want to borrow, neighbours are immediately sent a \u201cpush\u201d notification to which they can respond in a single touch. There&apos;s no doubting the intention of I Change My City, from Bangalore in India, which allows users to upload a geo-tagged picture of an urban problem issue which is then reported to the city\u2019s government. Residents can also vote to draw further attention to issues that are particularly troubling them. Similarly, SIGA Chile, from Santiago in Chile, maps how accessible public places are for people with disabilities. Users can evaluate places and their facilities, upload pictures and discuss how they could be improved. Mind My Business, from New York, employs open data and predictive analytics to update small, local shopkeepers on what\u2019s happening in their areas \u2013 from upcoming roadworks to recent complaints by nearby residents. Also from New York, Social Cyclist encourages bike riders to map their preferred routes, report hazardous road conditions and vote on preferred locations for future cycling infrastructure. The app can also report problems with bike-sharing schemes. Sticking with transport, the thorny issue of car parking is tackled by two of the shortlisted apps. Blue Parking, from Valladolid in Spain, provides a real-time overview of available parking spots without the need for sensors. It also allows in-app payment, with a printable code allowing traffic wardens to check the required dosh has been coughed up. Parqueate, from Bogot\u00e1, boasts the biggest database of parking facilities in the Colombian capital and invites users to add new parking spots as well as rate existing ones. In the future, it is planned that users will be able to rent out their unused parking spaces through the app.  Meanwhile Djump, which works in Paris and Brussels, is a peer-to-peer car-sharing service that allows drivers with a car to register, users to request a ride, and drivers to answer the call. Users can track drivers in real time, then choose to give a voluntary donation at the end of the ride. Last but definitely not least, Switch Skate Guide, from S\u00e3o Paulo, allows users to add to and browse an evolving map of good (and bad) skate locations. They can geo-tag their pictures and videos to a particular spot, as well as interacting with other users. The competition judges will now assess these 10 shortlisted apps, and Guardian Cities will announce the three finalists on Wednesday 21 May. The three will be invited to the New Cities Summit in Dallas on 17-19 June, where they will each have five minutes to present their app. Following the presentations, the audience will cast a live vote to select the winner.

But while debate has thus far been limited to Britain&apos;s &quot;science base&quot; regarding jobs, wider national concerns are at stake. British science is indeed about employees undertaking research, yet also about ethical practice. While comparing the research ethics approaches of manufacturers is not straightforward, Pfizer&apos;s record of exploiting epidemics (decried by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res), dead and brain-damaged children, and forged certification in clinical trials in west Africa (as reported in the Washington Post in 2006) is less than enviable. Repeats of such episodes within an Anglo-American project would damage &quot;brand Britain&quot; and UK scientists&apos; reputation around the world. Closer to home, the clout of the larger pharmaceutical manufacturers enables them to influence UK regulation policies for safety and cost-effectiveness \u2013 as Professor John Abraham&apos;s and others&apos; research demonstrates. Further expansion of the world&apos;s largest drug company would grant Pfizer greater leverage upon policies regarding the scrutinising of drug safety (MHRA; EMA) and value for money (Nice). Patient safety and future cost-effectiveness of NHS spending would not accordingly be aided by the proposed merger, especially when the politics around pharmaceuticals is blinkered towards jobs. It thus seems naive of Shapps to advocate this merger in &quot;economic&quot; terms, especially given the reluctance of Pfizer&apos;s CEO to make promises about UK-based jobs and the recent history of the company&apos;s research and development policies in east Kent. Dr Patrick BrownAssistant professor, Amsterdam Institute of Social Science Research, University of Amsterdam \u2022\u2008A simple solution that would protect a vital centre of British research excellence and save the taxpayer billions: the NHS should create a non-profit pharmaceutical company, supplying direct to the NHS and competing in the world market. The drugs companies would be frightened into cutting their prices, because such a model would quickly be followed by most European nations. This would protect vital R&amp;D excellence as the inherent idealism of scientists in the field would be maximised to be able to follow need rather than profit.Professor Colin PritchardSchool of health and social care, Bournemouth University \u2022 Any scrutiny of the bid by Pfizer for AstraZeneca on grounds of national interest (Report, 6 May) entails an examination of the tax implications. Mergers encouraged by tax rules in the 1960s and 70s were found to have been detrimental to corporate efficiency. Britain is now perceived as a lax tax jurisdiction compared to the US. Pfizer could gain by taking advantage of lower corporation tax rates and the culture of hesitant enforcement of tax rules by HMRC by locating its tax affairs in the UK. In the New York Times (3 May), Steven Rattner points out that about two dozen US companies have changed tax residence through cross-border mergers since 2008. Gaming of corporate tax rules to reduce the burden to Pfizer may not necessarily free more money for R&amp;D. In fact the pressure to earn money through product innovation may even be reduced by increasing opportunity to earn money by the gaming of tax rules, and exercising greater market power in negotiations with healthcare providers.SP ChakravartyBangor \u2022 On bank holiday Monday Pfizer announced a 15% fall in profits in the three months to the end of March compared with the previous year, to $2.3bn (\u00a31.3bn). This was caused by falling revenues (down 9%) from patents expiring. It is still a profitable company, but shareholders will now be looking urgently for changes to cut costs and increase profits in the short term. Real risks to UK jobs \u2013 both research staff and in the factories \u2013 are obvious. David Cameron&apos;s initial enthusiasm for this deal now appears to have been naive. Grant Shapps&apos;s comment that Labour&apos;s proposal to toughen the rules was &quot;anti-business, anti-jobs and anti-jobs security&quot; now sounds foolhardy, putting short-term election politics above the UK&apos;s long-term interests. The defence industry is subject to detailed investigation prior to government approval for external takeovers of this sort. The business secretary, Vince Cable, can intervene under the Enterprise Act. He should do so and ensure that the pharmaceutical and other key industries are also protected against unwelcome takeovers. We are one of the few industrial countries without such safeguards. Lack of protection endangers both our economic recovery and UK jobs. Free trade is fine, but the UK must not become an open market for foreign companies to buy our best companies and patents at knockdown prices. Such prudent action should get support across all parties. Brian BeanLondon \u2022 As an investor, I will be bitterly disappointed if Pfizer takes over AstraZeneca. Annual dividends of around \u00a31.80 still seem worthwhile, even at the inflated share price near \u00a350 today, while Pfizer&apos;s dollar a share last year looks puny. Even if I were offered two Pfizer shares for each Astra share, I wouldn&apos;t be interested. And as investment manager Neil Woodford has reportedly said: &quot;A cashing-out exercise is no use to me \u2013 there isn&apos;t another AstraZeneca out there.&quot; City speculators who want a cash payout may welcome the bid, but long-term investors will not. Of course, we know from the Royal Mail sell-off that government ministers don&apos;t care about long-term investors \u2013 their pals in the City want short-term profits. Expect ministers to procrastinate while investors suffer.Richard CooperChichester, West Sussex \u2022 Since Thatcher, the UK has been the global model for liberalisation, taking for granted that all investment opportunities will be open to transnational and foreign investors so completely that it is never even mentioned. The results can be seen in the private sector, where we no longer own anything nationally. In the public sector, the involvement of transnational and foreign corporations in privatisations of whichever kind (contracting, sell-offs, PFIs) invokes international treaties that prevent reversals of the underpinning privatisations \u2013 even when people want them reversed. It is time to articulate what liberalisation means, that it has been a political choice and that there are alternatives. The 51% domestic ownership that many other countries enforce would be one alternative. Linda Kaucher London \u2022 The reluctance of Labour to adopt the radical policies based on fairness that, according to the polls, most of the electorate want is apparently partly based on the inevitable alarmist Tory response. This fear, however, is misguided, because whatever policies are chosen, the response is always the same. Even when Miliband proposes the eminently sensible tightening of the &quot;rules to protect key British companies&quot; the Tories take the predictable &quot;anti-business, anti-jobs and anti-jobs security&quot; stance (Coalition rift over \u00a363bn offer for UK drugs group, 5 May), Last week Labour&apos;s very moderate rent proposals, which concentrated on limiting future increases rather than on reversing recent rent hikes, inspecting rented property and taxing profiteering landlords, received similar treatment, even stretching to &quot;Venezuelan-style rent controls&quot; from Shapps (Comment is free, 1 May). Hopefully the Labour leaders will realise the obvious; no matter what the proposal, the Tory response will be hysterical, alarmist, or inaccurate, and possibly all three. Let them rant about &quot;red Ed&quot;, &quot;communism&quot; and &quot;written by McCluskey&quot; for all they&apos;re worth, because it appears that is all the Tories have; they can hardly boast of fairness. Grasp the nettle, Mr Miliband, and let&apos;s have ideas and policies that transform, not tinkering!Bernie EvansLiverpool \u2022 It has been said that those who control the land control our stomachs. Therefore it is as important for Labour to press for a change in the law to create a new public interest test to cover not just British industry but British land too (Co-op farms could be sold to China as hopes of community buyouts die, 5 May).Geoffrey Keith NaylorWinchester \u2022 Nils Pratley refers to Pfizer as &quot;seeking rent in a country where it has no roots&quot; (3 May). But as a child in the early 60s, I played on fields opposite its Sandwich premises, later covered by massive expansion. Older companions assured me that, if you got close to the buildings, you could hear the screams of the monkeys. Despite these formative memories, I agree with Nils Pratley that Pfizer should not be allowed to get away with buying AstraZeneca as a tax dodge. The imposition of much higher UK tax rates on companies in those days clearly didn&apos;t stunt their growth.Vivienne PayFrome \u2022 Cameron says &quot;the decision on any merger is a decision for the two companies and their shareholders&quot;.

Binoche, known for her on-screen roles in The English Patient and Chocolat, will take a starring role in the new translation of Sophocles&apos;s Greek tragedy at London&apos;s Barbican centre in March 2015. Binoche has a long and reputable past on the stage, having made her London debut in 1998 in Luigi Pirandello&apos;s Naked at the Almeida. In 2000 she was nominated for a Tony award for her appearance in a Broadway production of Harold Pinter&apos;s Betrayal. This will also mark her second appearance at the Barbican, having starred in the French production Mademoiselle Julie \u2013 based on Strindberg&apos;s Miss Julie \u2013 in 2012. The Barbican commissioned Canadian poet Anne Carson, who won the TS Eliot prize in 2001 for her collection The Beauty of the Husband, to translate the Greek tragedy afresh for the production. The classic play tells the story of Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus, who faces death after she defies her uncle King Creon and buries her dead brother. Ivo Van Hove, whose production of A View From the Bridge is currently at the Young Vic, will direct Antigone. He said that he and Binoche had agreed that this was &quot;the right artistic challenge&quot; for their first collaboration. &quot;The play itself has the explosiveness of a nuclear bomb,&quot; he said. &quot;It deals with all possible relationships: man against woman, political against ethical leadership, the laws of society against the right of the individual, family and its unbreakable blood ties. Antigone should resonate with everyone the world over.&quot; Toni Racklin, head of theatre at the Barbican, said she was &quot;thrilled&quot; by the new production: &quot;We bring back Juliette Binoche, following her mesmerising performances in Mademoiselle Julie here in 2012, and Ivo van Hove, with whom we have a long-standing relationship through Roman Tragedies and Scenes From a Marriage. &quot;Our international programme enabled these two world-class artists to meet and collaborate for the first time.&quot; Following its stint at the Barbican, the production will embark on an international tour to deSingel in Antwerp, Stadsschouwburg in Amsterdam, Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and finally to the 2015 Edinburgh international festival. \u2022 Tickets go on general sale on 16 May. www.barbican.org.uk", "sentences": ["&quot;Our international programme enabled these two world-class artists to meet and collaborate for the first time.&quot; Following its stint at the Barbican, the production will embark on an international tour to deSingel in Antwerp, Stadsschouwburg in Amsterdam, Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and finally to the 2015 Edinburgh international festival."], "title": "Juliette Binoche returns to London stage in new adaptation of Antigone", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/08/juliette-binoche-returns-to-london-stage-in-antigone-barbican", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Barbican", "Culture", "Juliette Binoche", "Sophocles", "Film"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-09T06:00:06Z", "article": "ODI Cricket: Scotland v England10am, Sky Sports 2 This is just the third time England have visited Scotland for a one-day cricket international and the first time since 2010.

Five teenage prodigies \u2013 Hayley Parkes, Isata Kanneh-Mason, Martin James Bartlett, Julian Trevelyan, See Ning Hui \u2013 have 16 minutes each to persuade the judges that they&apos;re worth a spot in the semi-final. Andrew Mueller The Minster8pm, BBC2 In a series first shown on BBC1 North and North East, cameras follow life at gothically splendid York Minster for a year. The first thing that becomes clear is the sheer scale of the place, so vast that 16 miles of scaffolding are needed for the restoration of the East End exterior. But there are also more human-sized moments, such as when head verger Alex Carberry ascends in a hoist to drape a cloth over a cross suspended 40ft above the floor. A watching colleague: &quot;He should have a high-vis cassock.&quot; Jonathan Wright Weekend Escapes With Warwick Davis8pm, ITV Warwick Davis&apos;s film career \u2013 in Willow, Return Of The Jedi and the Harry Potter films \u2013 is a mainstream affair. His TV career, working under the auspices of Ricky Gervais, has been a bit edgier. This series of low-key domestic travel excursions has served to put Warwick, wife Sam and his two children back in a rather more Martin Clunesy kind of place. Tonight Warwick takes his family to visit north Wales: weightlifting, singing, and induction as an honorary Jedi Knight await him. John Robinson Natural World: Pigmy Hippo \u2013 A Very Secret Life9pm, BBC2 Australian ecologist Wei-Yeen Yap heads for the rainforests of the Ta\u00ef National Park in the Ivory Coast in search of the pygmy hippo, a secretive and very much endangered beast, with just 2\u20133,000 left in the wild. Not as rambunctious or deadly as their full-scale counterparts, their reclusiveness means that we know little about how these creatures live. Ben Arnold Perception9pm, Watch Eric McCormack returns as the schizophrenic boffin who helps the police solve crimes. His assistant, Max, needs his boss&apos;s help this week when little brother Kenny turns up with a whole truckload of trouble and a subplot about racial stereotyping dragging behind him. With his unseen &quot;voice&quot; Natalie appearing to act as his imaginary schizophrenic sounding-board this should be a lot more interesting than it is. But it&apos;s essentially just Will from Will &amp; Grace not stretching himself at all while other stuff happens. Bit dull. Julia Raeside The Trip To Italy10pm, BBC2 The last leg of Steve and Rob&apos;s passive-aggressive perambulation through Italy takes them to Capri&apos;s Il Riccio. Meeting with Coogan&apos;s son Joe and all-round fixer Emma, Rob breaks the news of his burgeoning film career with confirmation of a leading role in Michael Mann&apos;s latest opus. Conversely, Steve reveals plans to settle closer to home. Changes are afoot then, but curiously there&apos;s little sense of closure here. Could a tertiary Trip be beckoning? Mark Jones Outsiders With Darren McMullen10pm, National Geographic Darren McMullen, the presenter of The Voice in Australia, meets Europeans with alternative lifestyles. It&apos;s a series that could come off as tiresomely intrusive and voyeuristic, but McMullen has an easy-going demeanour that largely heads off this possibility. His willingness to join in helps, too, such as when he pimps himself \u2013 without going too far \u2013 at the behest of septuagenarian twin prostitutes the Fokken sisters in Amsterdam&apos;s red-light district.

The occultist Aleister Crowley&apos;s first great love affair, with fellow Cambridge undergraduate Herbert Jerome Pollitt, was in ruins, and he took to poetry as his only solace. &quot;When my sick body in his love lies drowned/ And he lies corpse-wise on me, nor will rise/ Though my breath shudders, and my soul be dead,&quot; he wrote \u2013 and much, much more \u2013 in a tiny notebook of unpublished manuscript poems which has recently resurfaced. The actor and rare book dealer Neil Pearson, who will exhibit the little book at the Olympia antiquarian book fair in London later this month, concedes that this is not great poetry. &quot;The verse is rather broken-backed, and vulgar where he is trying to be honest. But it was written at a time when he was feeling heartbroken and vulnerable and it does somehow humanise him \u2013 and God knows Aleister Crowley, more than most people, needs humanising.&quot; Crowley, who called himself the Great Beast 666 and pursued a lifelong interest in magic and the wilder shores of religion and sex, was nicknamed the Wickedest Man in the World by the British magazine John Bull after a former follower made a series of lurid allegations, including the claim she and her husband had been forced to drink the blood of a sacrificed cat. Born in 1875, Crowley was a novelist, yoga enthusiast, heroin addict, occultist, sexual adventurer, magician, some say spy, and perhaps most improbably, enthusiastic mountaineer who scaled K2, the Eiger and many other peaks. His bisexuality led to his expulsion from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a society dedicated to arcane ritual and magic which flourished across Europe in the late 19th century, with celebrity followers including the poet WB Yeats, who detested Crowley. The Great Beast founded his own cult inspired by Ancient Egypt, with tortuous rituals \u2013 including anal sex \u2013 for different grades of initiates, and was later thrown out of Sicily by Mussolini for sexual depravity. He died penniless in a Hastings boarding house in 1947. In 1898 he was 22, and had fallen heavily for Pollitt, a fellow undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge, renowned in student circles as a theatrical female impersonator under the name Diane de Rougy. They met in October 1897, broke up before Christmas, wrote yearning letters to one another over the holidays, and became lovers on New Year&apos;s Eve, an event recorded by Crowley as &quot;admitted to permanent office in the Temple, midnight, December 31, 1897&quot;. A few months later it was all over. Crowley would later write: &quot;Pollitt was rather plain than otherwise. His face was made tragic by the terrible hunger of the eyes and the bitter sadness of the mouth. He possessed one physical beauty - his hair ... its colour was pale gold, like spring sunshine, and its texture of the finest gossamer. The relation between us was that ideal intimacy which the Greeks considered the greatest glory of manhood and the most precious prize of life.&quot; Pearson, who found the notebook through his interest in early gay literature, says it is the earliest known Crowley manuscript. Explicitly homoerotic and often sadomasochistic \u2013 &quot;A sailor&apos;s kiss is branded on my throat/ Where his teeth infamous bit hard the skin&quot; \u2013 the poems would have been unprintable when written, says Pearson, and only two have ever been published. However, he is intrigued that Crowley had spared the collection of eight sonnets, including &quot;He, who seduced me first&quot; and &quot;I, who am dying for thy kiss&quot;, and six other poems, all written in pencil in a cheap palm-sized notebook bought in Amsterdam, when he destroyed all his other early poetry. &quot;He destroyed the poetry because he was the priest, the master, the leader, and it didn&apos;t suit his image to be seen as weak and vulnerable. But he kept this little book all his life, so the poems obviously meant a great deal to him,&quot; Pearson adds. The book will be for sale at the fair, priced at \u00a312,500. &quot;It&apos;s one of those distillates of history that tell us so much more than the official version,&quot; he says. \u2022 The Red Lips of the Octopus, from the Amsterdam Notebook of Aleister Crowley The red lips of the octopus Are more than myriad stars of night. The great beast writhes in fiercer form than thirsty stallions amorous I would they clung to me and stung. I would they quenched me with delight. The red lips of the octopus. They reek with poison of the sea Scarlet and hot and languorous My skin drinks in their slaver warm, my sweats his wrapt embrace excite The heavy sea rolls languishly o&apos;er the ensanguined kiss of us. We strain and strive, we die for love. We linger in the lusty fight We agonize; our club becomes more cruel and more murderous. My passion splashes out at last.

One striking, bohemian-looking couple catch the eye. &quot;On 22 May,&quot; reads the legend above their black fedora hats, &quot;Jens and Sedsel will choose who&apos;s in charge in Europe. And you?&quot; Below their feet is the slogan: &quot;European elections 22 May 2014. Act. React. Impact.&quot; Perhaps the Strasbourg assembly should be careful what it wishes for. Jens and Sedsel may be signed up to the programme. But across the continent, those who may not have the best interests of the European Union at heart are marching on the parliament, from both the right and left of the political spectrum. The insurgents are certainly looking to &quot;act, react and impact&quot;, but not in the way that the designers of the Strasbourg posters may have hoped. In Britain, Ukip&apos;s Nigel Farage, pint in hand, has already pulled British politics to a place close to the EU exit door. But euroscepticism is no longer a curiosity of these islands. Marine Le Pen, leader of France&apos;s Front National, has even grander designs than Farage. Le Pen plans to use the forthcoming elections to form an alliance dedicated to wrecking the &quot;monster in Brussels&quot; from within. Her party is on course to top the polls in France. In Italy, an ex-comic, Beppe Grillo, whose anti-establishment shtick has its origins in the anarchic left, ridicules the recent succession of Italian prime ministers who have &quot;become the slaves of financial interests and economic decisions taken elsewhere&quot;. The Five-Star movement which he founded in 2007 is second in Italy&apos;s polls, predicted to win 25% of the vote. The Greek socialists of Syriza are riding high from Athens to Alexandroupoli on the back of a promise to roll back crushing EU-imposed debt repayments. Even in the land of Borgen, where consensus politics provided an unlikely template for cult television viewing, rebellion is in the air. The Danish People&apos;s party \u2013 anti-EU, anti-multiculturalism and anti-immigration \u2013 is pledging to &quot;assert Denmark&apos;s independence and to guarantee the freedom of the Danish people in their own country&quot;. The DPP, which like Ukip has profited from popular resentment at the extension of welfare benefits to immigrant workers, sits in first place in the polls, also with a share of 25%. In the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, and across much of eastern Europe, it is a similar story. Two weeks from the elections, it seems possible \u2013 probable even \u2013 that Eurosceptic parties could gain up to a third of the total vote and up to 200 of the 751 seats in the next European parliament. Given that less than half of the Union&apos;s electorate are likely to vote at all, those figures suggest an overwhelming majority of Europeans are either apathetic towards the ongoing project of a common borderless European home or actively hostile. Never mind Jens and Sedsel. If they were still among us, Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, Altiero Spinelli, founding fathers all of the EU, might be wondering: &quot;How did Europe lose its way?&quot; Left behind in the &apos;global race&apos; EU officials in search of an answer could do worse than travel to Forbach in the region of Lorraine, at the historic core of the union. A former mining town, Forbach was there at the birth of the European dream, one of the dynamos of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) brought into being after the war by victorious France and defeated Germany The ECSC, proposed by Robert Schuman, the French foreign minister at the time, and inspired by the visionary French diplomat Jean Monnet, was created in 1951 by Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The unprecedented pooling of sovereignty over vital resources was a statement of intent: the western half of a devastated continent was determined that the wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45 should never be repeated. By 1957 the ECSC had morphed into the European Economic Community, or Common Market, and the road to the European Union had begun. But six decades on, blue-collar Forbach is no longer a showcase for the federal dreams of Schuman and Monnet. In fact, it&apos;s about to vote heavily for the self-styled patriots of the FN. The last mine here closed in 2004 and nothing much has taken its place as France has been gripped by economic stagnation and austerity following the crash of 2009. At the well-funded Mus\u00e9e les Mineurs, newsreels from the postwar glory days are shown on a constant loop. A narrator in 1947 asks: &quot;How could the miners not feel proud of what they represent? The reconstruction of France!&quot; But in the Forbach of 2014 unemployment stands at 14% and is far higher among the young. Vandalism and car-burning is common in the town&apos;s bleak suburbs, where refugees and migrants now occupy the postwar estates built for generations of miners. Shops, cafes, even the last bookshop, have disappeared. The town is dying. The sorry tale of decline is repeated in industrial and manufacturing towns across the EU, where the economic crisis of the last five years has finished off communities that were already losing their place in the new global economic order. China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam are where the new Forbachs are to be found. Ageing, economically insecure and fearful for the future, more and more Europeans are listening to populist calls for retrenchment behind old borders and old certainties. A generosity of spirit towards the outsider is being replaced by an embittered &quot;welfare chauvinism&quot;, and an insistence that French, Danish, Austrian or British workers come first. In March&apos;s mayoral elections in Forbach, the FN&apos;s plausible vice-president, Florian Philippot, won the first round of voting, before losing narrowly in the runoff against the incumbent Socialist, Laurent Kalinowski. In the European poll Philippot is all but certain to become an MEP for the region, elected on a platform of reinstituting border controls, withdrawal from the euro and French jobs for French workers. A graduate of the elite \u00c9cole Nationale d&apos;Administration, the breeding ground for France&apos;s political elite, Philippot represents a new generation of FN politician, which came of age during &quot;La Crise&quot;. A youthful, articulate 35-year-old, he is a far cry from the motley crew of neo-fascists who used to assemble under the banner of Jean-Marie Le Pen. Philippot&apos;s political hero is General Charles de Gaulle. &quot;The surge in support for the FN is a protest vote, a cry of pain,&quot; says Jean-Claude Flauss, a retired archivist and local historian. &quot;What is being done to this town is shameful. A population, having been exploited, is now being left to rot; a community is in the process of being dismantled. And a place which gave so much, which gave so many resources and so much wealth, is being abandoned to its fate.&quot; Flauss insists that xenophobia is not behind the local support for Philippot, although he says the decision to place hundreds of refugees in the town&apos;s struggling suburbs has been &quot;a problem to add to all the others&quot;. In the &quot;global race&quot; constantly invoked by Europe&apos;s politicians, Forbach feels ignored, forgotten and left behind. &quot;The people of Forbach are not racist,&quot; says Flauss. &quot;This has always been a place that welcomed strangers. In the 1920s it was the Italians who came. They fled Mussolini to come and work in the mines. They arrived with helmets in their hands, ready to work. In the 1930s it was the Polish. After the war, workers arrived from the Maghreb. This is a place with a history of openness and tolerance. No one really thinks withdrawing from the euro would be practical. Over 100,000 people cross the borders around here to work. But it&apos;s not hard to see why the FN would want to implant themselves in the town. People are desperate and want to show the world they are very, very fed up.&quot; Emil Dolic&apos;s father was one of those foreigners who came to work in the local pit, fleeing Tito&apos;s Yugoslavia in 1958. Dolic himself worked down Forbach&apos;s mine for 25 years, having grown up in the suburb of Behren-les-Forbach, where last month disaffected youth attacked the mayor&apos;s offices and the town was woken up by circling police helicopters. He thinks Philippot is a &quot;good man \u2013 not like Jean-Marie Le Pen who was just crazy&quot;, but cannot bring himself to vote FN. But he is deeply pessimistic about the future of the country that gave his father a new start: &quot;The Chinese can do everything more cheaply now and they don&apos;t have the welfare costs to worry about. We can&apos;t compete with them. When people are vulnerable and suffering, that&apos;s when the FN can exploit the situation.&quot; Throughout the region, Marine Le Pen&apos;s party is doing just that. In nearby Hayange, the famous Florange steelworks closed a year ago when the Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal took his investment elsewhere. An FN mayor \u2013 a former radical socialist \u2013 has just been elected there. Nationalism reborn? At the Front National&apos;s annual May Day parade in Paris, the talk is of France&apos;s latest industrial embarrassment: the potential sale of another &quot;national champion&quot;, the energy and transport giant Alstom, to America&apos;s General Electric. Lorraine loyalists are out in force. The favoured chant of the day is &quot;On est chez nous!&quot; (&quot;We are in our own home!&quot;) which reverberates through a marching crowd drawn from Provence, Franche-Comt\u00e9, Burgundy and beyond. The slogan is an angry assertion of what should be the case but isn&apos;t, as open markets and cheap labour from eastern Europe allegedly cut a swath through traditional French life. Among the ancient flags of Brittany and the Vend\u00e9e and the fleur-de-lis which is a traditional symbol of French royalism, other banners ram home more contemporary points: &quot;Europe is our prison!&quot;, &quot;- EU and + France&quot;, &quot;They toast each other in Brussels at our expense!&quot; Walking past the Palais Royal, a new chant goes up: &quot;Ni gauche ni droite: Front National!&quot; (&quot;Neither left nor right: Front National.&quot;) Thierry Gaulot, a newly elected FN council member for Metz, around 35 miles from Forbach, insists that this is no longer about the old preoccupations of the French royalist right. In its efforts to break through, the FN has gone ecumenical, both at home and abroad, where it hopes to become the standard-bearer of a new &quot;Europe des Peuples&quot;. &quot;This is now a party that is based on a patriotism that can appeal to the left as much as the right,&quot; Gaulot says. &quot;There are plenty who have joined us from parties of the left. Nigel Farage says we are antisemitic? People who talk about racism or fascism are just not opening their minds. Listen to that chant, &apos;on est chez nous&apos;. It&apos;s about sovereignty; about the global economy being run on the terms of the multinationals who can up sticks to go where they can make more profit.&quot; When Marine Le Pen appears to speak in the Place de l&apos;Op\u00e9ra, she is dressed in marine blue. Behind her is a backdrop depicting a giant Joan of Arc, blowing away the yellow stars of the European Union flag. Le Pen has big ambitions for these elections, hoping to use the Eurosceptic surge across the continent to form an &quot;enemy within&quot; the European parliament, in alliance with the Dutch far-right Freedom party leader, Geert Wilders. To form a &quot;European Freedom Alliance&quot; in Strasbourg, she and Wilders will require a minimum of 25 MEPs from seven member states. Up to now, Farage has insisted that Ukip will not be joining. But the Austrian Freedom party and Vlaams Belang, the Flemish nationalist party, both appear to be on board. The Danish People&apos;s party and Italy&apos;s Northern League are also allies. Judging by the current polls, the threshold of 25 MEPs will be easily crossed. Once installed, the alliance will become an awkward, obstructionist presence, committed, in the words of the Northern League&apos;s Matteo Salvini, to &quot;a different Europe, based on work and peoples and not in the one based on servitude to the euro and banks, ready to let us die from immigration and unemployment&quot;. In Paris, in a Wagnerian downpour, Le Pen laments the betrayal of France. She inveighs against the &quot;gravediggers&quot; of Brussels, whose austerity measures are held responsible for the scourge of mass unemployment and economic stagnation. France&apos;s new Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, is denounced for introducing a new round of cuts \u2013 \u20ac11bn from welfare payments, \u20ac10bn from healthcare \u2013 in order to lower France&apos;s budget deficit to satisfy the European commission. &quot;Manuel Valls has no idea how to govern France,&quot; Le Pen tells the crowd. &quot;The destiny of this country is being decided in Brussels.&quot; President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is little more than &quot;the little governor of the province of France&quot;. At the same time, she says, mass immigration, attributed to the EU&apos;s &quot;ultra-liberalism&quot;, is undermining the nation&apos;s sense of identity. Immigrants must accommodate to French culture, not the other way round. &quot;The French people no longer control anything: banks, money, borders.&quot; The coming EU-US trade deal is an invitation to American farmers to put their French equivalents out of business. &quot;States have a lot in common with human beings,&quot; Le Pen concludes. &quot;A state which controls nothing becomes a depressed state.&quot; As the microphone conks out in the deluge, she joins the crowd in an impromptu mass rendition of La Marseillaise. Then there is one final message for Brussels: &quot;In other countries, other peoples are rallying to our side. We want to build a Europe of free and sovereign nations. A Europe of peoples.&quot; A strange kind of democracy It was an early 19th-century utopian socialist who first dreamed up the idea of a European parliament. As the continent suffered the ravages of the Napoleonic wars, Henri de Saint-Simon pleaded for the creation of an elite assembly to run the continent along less sanguinary lines. The body would be attended by 21 &quot;delegates of humanity&quot; \u2013 a council of experts selected in England, France, Germany and Italy. &quot;As soon as elections have been held to the Supreme Council and to the Councils of individual nations&quot;, wrote Saint-Simon, &quot;the scourge of war will be banished from Europe.&quot; The modest dimensions of that original vision now seem somewhat quaint. Directly elected since 1979, the EU&apos;s parliament is a Goliath among the world&apos;s democratic fora. In two weeks&apos; time, 750 MEPs and one president will be elected to represent an estimated electorate of 501 million people in 28 countries. However, the ways of the EP have provided some open goals to its critics. The parliament has no tax-raising powers but rewards its representatives with a notoriously handsome package of salaries, expenses and grants. There is little obligation to furnish receipts. And Farage, recently embarrassed over the hiring of his German wife as a secretary, is not the only MEP to discover that a seat in the European parliament can become a family concern. Good ideas at the time have become expensive anomalies. In recognition of the historic reconciliation between France and Germany after the second world war, MEPs still trek once a month from Brussels to the parliament&apos;s official seat in Strasbourg, at a cost of \u20ac180m a year. Acknowledging that such needless expense is meat and drink to enemies of the European idea, MEPs led by the parliament&apos;s vice-president, Edward McMillan-Scott, have launched a &quot;Single Seat&quot; campaign to abandon &quot;Alcatraz&quot;, as the Strasbourg building is known to some of its inmates. But such gripes are small beer compared to the biggest problem for the parliament: a continuing lack of credibility among the electorates of Europe. The two major groupings in the assembly, the centre-right European People&apos;s party (EPP) and centre-left Socialists and Democrats (PES) have little purchase on voters who tend, when they vote at all, to use the quinquennial polls as an opportunity to sound off at domestic governments. MEPs have no power to initiate legislation, which is the unelected European commission&apos;s job. During the three-year melodrama of the eurozone crisis, they were concerned bystanders as the &quot;troika&quot;, composed of the commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, imposed an eye-watering level of austerity in bailed-out and indebted member states such as Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, where youth unemployment rates have soared above 50% in some regions. Endlessly, parliamentarians have battled for a greater say, recently gaining new legal powers over immigration and policing. And they did eventually show their teeth over the troika, releasing a highly critical report in March. MEPs&apos; support was also crucial in establishing a eurozone banking union designed to avoid taxpayer bailouts of banks in the future. But if the EU&apos;s elected body could not directly determine policy during the biggest crisis in the union&apos;s history, some might ask, what is the point of it? The steady decline in poll turnout, from 63% in 1979 to a miserable 43% five years ago, suggests a growing number of potential voters have come to the conclusion that there isn&apos;t one. Among the under-25s in 2009, the abstention rate was a damning and surely unsustainable 71%. As the European Freedom Alliance of Le Pen and Wilders prepares to embark on a wrecking mission in the parliament, it feels like a turning-point in the history of a much-lampooned institution. &quot;Somehow we need to create a European Demos, a European consciousness,&quot; says Anni Podimata, a Greek socialist who belongs to the centre-left grouping. &quot;At a national level we need to explain properly the challenges and benefits of Europe.&quot; But how? Searching for the great leap forward How about the first-ever European presidential debates? Last month citizens of Maastricht out for a stroll were treated to an unusual sight in the town&apos;s main square. In front of the Vrijthof theatre, a modest crowd was assembled, soon to be scattered by the arrival of a dark blue coach. Emblazoned across the front of vehicle in huge white letters was the single word &quot;Juncker&quot;. This was the campaign battlebus of Jean-Claude Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg and EPP candidate for the plum role of European commission president. As the much-discussed &quot;democratic deficit&quot; at the heart of the EU has become a crisis in the age of austerity, the debates are an attempt at a bailout. Or, as the Brussels-sponsored Debating Europe website puts it: &quot;The European Union is run by unelected bureaucrats right? Well it&apos;s not so simple \u2026 for the first time ever the European parliament will be putting forward candidates for position of the European commission president, giving citizens a real say in who runs the EU&apos;s executive arm.&quot; There are six candidates, including Martin Schulz of the PES, the liberal Guy Verhofstadt and, presumably hoping to cause trouble, Alexis Tsipras, the socialist scourge of Brussels-inspired cuts in Greece. The winner will be the candidate whose parliamentary group secures the most votes later this month. Who knew? Certainly not the average Labour voter, because Ed Miliband has run a mile from Schulz, whose federalist vision of the EU&apos;s future goes way beyond the pale for British consumption in the Ukip era. Labour dissociated the party from Schulz&apos;s campaign, saying: &quot;Martin Schulz&apos;s political priorities in Europe do not represent those of the Labour party. While not being able to support the PES common candidate for this year&apos;s election, we continue to support the principle of having common candidates.&quot; The day after the debate, Guy Verhofstadt is in a chipper mood. Once the enfant terrible of politics in Belgium, where he was a youthful prime minister for nine years, the polls show him as the clear winner of the evening. &quot;It&apos;s great that this is taking place,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s never happened in 20 years. For the first time a democratic European debate is emerging on the future of Europe.&quot; Verhofstadt is a founding member of the Spinelli Group, named after the dissident Italian communist who, during the second world war, produced a manifesto for a federal union across the European continent. Founded in 2010, the group calls for a revival of &quot;the European spirit&quot;. But Verhofstadt admits that the union has an image problem. &quot;What is it? Is it a confederation or a federation. Is it intergovernmental, or is it communitarian. Is it a group of 6, 9, 12, 15, 17 or more? Who is in the Schengen agreement [to abolish internal borders] and who isn&apos;t? Who is in the euro and who isn&apos;t? Who is opting out of that and who is opting into this? It&apos;s overly complex.&quot; For Verhofstadt, the mop-haired bespectacled face of radical federalism for over a decade, there is, however, no going back. A driver of vintage racing cars for a hobby, he believes that only a future United States of Europe can compete in the global race with China, India and the other emerging economies of Asia. If places such as Forbach are to thrive in the 21st century, &quot;you have to reinvent the idea of sovereignty&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s no answer for nation states to retreat behind their own borders,&quot; he continues. &quot;The eurosceptics have no solutions, just scapegoats. Take energy. America has a common energy policy and they are net exporters. Europe has 28 different energy policies. That gives America a competitive advantage. Show me the person who will say, &apos;I want to hold onto national sovereignty even if it means higher prices.&apos;&quot; When it comes to the great austerity plan, he insists there was no alternative. The cost of borrowing in heavily indebted countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy had become unsustainable. &quot;Budget discipline was necessary and debts had to come down,&quot; says Verhofstadt. But the savage consequences of the cuts could and should have been mitigated by more solidarity between states at EU level. &quot;The Eurosceptics are right that the crisis has been badly handled. Austerity has been dictating policy, but we need to think about growth as well. We should be pooling the debt of eurozone states above 60% and we&apos;re not doing it&quot;. The future must be about deeper integration. &quot;It&apos;s not about a superstate. It&apos;s about more integration as the engine of growth, unified capital markets, a unified banking system, common debt in the eurozone. There&apos;s no credit union in the EU, so it&apos;s difficult to get credit in another country. That&apos;s crazy.&quot; For those content that the eurozone should remain at the halfway house of a single currency with national markets, he has a dire prediction: &quot;If in the end you don&apos;t fully integrate, then you may as well stop with the currency. And that would lead to the decline of Europe. The Europeans would not be able to compete with China and India.&quot; Will anyone listen to Verhofstadt&apos;s warning? It is true that the history of EU integration is punctuated by crises that have not gone to waste. The horror of the second world war led to the founding of the Coal and Steel Community. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe saw the EU expand eastwards at breakneck speed. But in the Europe of 2014, evangelists of a United States of Europe will have to fight even to get a hearing. Alongside the resurgent nationalism on view in the northern capitals of London, Paris, Amsterdam and Copenhagen, new anti-politics movements are on the rise in the south, born out of frustration with all &apos;&quot;political elites&quot;, whether national or European. Send in the clowns Beppe Grillo has been described as &quot;the most dangerous man in Europe&quot; by the German magazine Der Spiegel. The rebarbative Italian comic took that as a compliment. For over a year, this satirist-turned-populist firebrand has been laying waste to the traditional landscape of Italian politics. Piazzas have filled from Sicily to Turin, as crowds have gathered to hear messianic calls for a new grassroots, web-based, democratic culture, and a bonfire of the vanities of Italy&apos;s corrupt political caste. Opponents accuse Grillo of a facile moralism and unappealing vulgarity \u2013 his rise began in earnest with the organisation of &quot;Fuck Off Day&quot; in 2007, which outed the numerous Italian parliamentarians carrying previous convictions. The comic&apos;s fierce hostility to organised political parties has even been compared to Mussolini&apos;s attacks on parliamentary democracy. In February last year, Grillo&apos;s Five Star Movement \u2013 a loose network of local groups organised online around his own blog \u2013 gained an astonishing 26% of the vote at the Italian election. &quot;Send in the clowns,&quot; ironised the Economist. This year the 65-year-old is taking on Brussels, wrapping himself \u2013 literally \u2013 in the EU flag and touring the country performing a vituperative one-man show entitled Te lo do io l&apos;Europa (&quot;I&apos;ll give you Europe&quot;). Italians used to be the biggest Europe enthusiasts, seeing Brussels as a means of escape from the dysfunction of the state that gave the world Silvio Berlusconi. But the Europe described by Grillo to his audiences shares the DNA of the &quot;eurocracy&quot; presented to French voters by Marine Le Pen: anti-democratic and, in its pursuit of austerity, economically ruinous. According to Grillo, from the moment the unelected former European commissioner Mario Monti was appointed prime minister of Italy in 2011, in the midst of the country&apos;s sovereign debt crisis, Brussels has controlled Italy&apos;s economic destiny. &quot;It&apos;s not a mystery,&quot; Grillo writes in his blog, &quot;that (national) governments are created and destroyed in Brussels. It&apos;s happened in Greece, in Portugal, and it&apos;s happening in Italy. Three Italian governments have been decided by the EU. We need to go into Europe to change Italy. Our prime ministers have become servants of financial interests and economic strategies decided elsewhere.&quot; The Five Star Movement is calling for a referendum on membership of the euro and an immediate end to the &quot;fiscal compact&quot; designed to ensure budget discipline in indebted EU states. If the Five Star Movement can gain 20-30 seats in the Strasbourg parliament, Grillo reckons that &quot;the current balance of power will be turned upside down&quot;. Polls suggest that, at around 25% of the vote, his candidates are on course to reach that target. Grillo&apos;s MEPs will never join the nationalist front run by Le Pen and Wilders, but their presence in the parliament will open up another flank of dissent. While Europe&apos;s nationalist right is attempting to disinter the nation-state and relive the glory days of the postwar boom, the Five Star Movement has more in common with the anarchic radicalism of the Spanish indignados or the Occupy movement. The anger is representative of a generation of young Europeans who face lower living standards than their parents and little chance of finding a meaningful job. In Ascoli Piceno, where Massimo Tamburri is standing as a mayoral candidate for the Five Star Movement, the youth unemployment rate is 47%. &quot;The young are just condemned to stay with their families,&quot; he says. &quot;There is just huge frustration. I have friends who have been in a relationship for five or six years but they still live with their parents.&quot; Rome, says Tamburri, isn&apos;t working, and neither is Brussels as presently constituted. &quot;It&apos;s not a community. It&apos;s not got an egalitarian politics. The only positive things \u2013 and they&apos;re not enough \u2013 are initiatives like the Erasmus student exchange programme and free movement within the union.&quot; The celebrated satirist and Nobel prize winner Dario Fo \u2013 at 88 one of the grand old men of Italian culture \u2013 is one of Grillo&apos;s most impassioned supporters. Fo has spent a lifetime on the turbulent left of Italian politics, arguing with the fanatics of the Red Brigades in the 1970s and satirising the right in plays such as Chain Me Up and I&apos;ll Still Smash Everything. Now he says: &quot;I&apos;m not on the left. I&apos;m a democrat.&quot; Disillusioned with the broken promises and clientelism of mainstream parties, the cardinal virtues for Fo have become &quot;civic commitment&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot;. At his summer home on the Adriatic coast, surrounded by his own paintings and photographs of his late wife, Franca Rame, he has been hosting political discussion groups on where the Five Star Movement goes next. &quot;I had a very lively meeting here yesterday,&quot; he says. &quot;Fifty or so people came here, young men and women from Rimini, Ravenna, Cesena, and we talked about where we should go with this movement in which so much has happened so quickly&quot;. &quot;The Five Star Movement is the only means of climbing out of the pit,&quot; says Fo, &quot;the only way of leaving behind the hypocrisy and the swindling in politics. In the eurozone crisis we know that there was speculation and that the banks were saved by the governments of various states. In Italy we&apos;ve now had three governments without elections, and this was not a clean process. We were told that everyone had to make sacrifices to save our nation and then we see that it&apos;s the usual mugs who pay up: workers, small businessmen, students and pensioners and so on.&quot; Fo backs the Five Star Movement&apos;s call for a referendum on the euro. &quot;I don&apos;t know how I would vote in it. I would reflect for a while,&quot; he says. &quot;But let&apos;s see what the referendum result would actually be, if it&apos;s positive or negative. Let&apos;s have some democracy here rather than have everything done behind closed doors.&quot; As cultural grandees such as Fo bemoan the current state of &quot;the project&quot; along with thousands of younger activists an urgent defence may be required. There are signs that one may be coming. Who will stand up for &apos;Europe&apos;? Herman Van Rompuy, a man whose very name seems to provoke mirth in anglocentric circles, is known for composing the occasional haiku. But the Belgian president of the European Council \u2013 the intergovernmental apex of the EU \u2013 generally has the reputation of being the driest of dry sticks. To coincide with the coming elections, however, he has published a passionate defence of Europe and all, or most, of its works. In Europe in the storm: Lessons and Challenges, Van Rompuy writes: &quot;Even the eurosceptic voters don&apos;t want to return to the past. Who wants to go back to the old times, to the customs frontiers that existed before 1954? How many people really want to return to national currencies, after the crisis of the euro? Very few! &quot;People know very well that not only is there an added value, but also that Europe can never disappear again from their way of life. People have criticised, here and there, abuses linked to the free movement of people. But in the context of the whole acquis [accumulated legislation], that&apos;s ridiculous! The cost of no Europe would be enormous!&quot; Complacency or common sense? There is no doubt that &quot;Europe&quot;, overwhelmingly, has been a force for good in the world, from the securing of the postwar peace, to the promotion of human rights, to the simple freedoms that allow a European to drive a car from Milan to Brussels without stopping at a single checkpoint. Outside its borders, as the rush of post-communist states to join the EU demonstrated, Europe is usually seen as an attractive model of democratic decency. In an interview with the Belgian paper Le Soir, Van Rompuy noted: &quot;In Africa \u2026 Europe is perceived as the homeland of democracy. The colonial Europe has been forgotten. There is a new Europe which is the biggest donor of development aid and which intervenes militarily only to help. What was our self-interest in intervening in the Central African Republic? None. We mustn&apos;t lose sight of this.&quot; But even Van Rompuy would admit that recent post-crash history, to put it mildly, has soured the mood. In Brussels, as economic growth slowly returns, there is hope that spirits may lighten. One senior EU official, now retired but an influence in the commission&apos;s glory days under Jacques Delors, says: &quot;I can see it now. The commission will be saying, &apos;O ye of little faith. It was unpopular, but austerity has worked. We&apos;re on the right track.&apos;&quot; Perhaps. But the damage of the last few years has been colossal, as testified to by those extraordinary youth unemployment rates in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. And the challenge of preserving European living standards as the continent&apos;s population ages, and the world&apos;s centre of economic gravity shifts east, is immense. Ever the optimist, Verhofstadt is already preparing for the fightback after this month&apos;s elections. &quot;This month,&quot; he says, &quot;you will see a kind of victory for the Eurosceptics. But that will hopefully lead to the emergence of a pro-European electorate and eventually to the new leap forward that we need.&quot; Welcome to the dialectics of hope, EU-style. But as Europeans, or some of them, go to the polls this month, it will be a long time before anyone in Brussels can echo with confidence the famous injunction of Jean Monnet: &quot;Continue, continue, there is no future for the people of Europe other than in union.&quot;", "sentences": ["Alongside the resurgent nationalism on view in the northern capitals of London, Paris, Amsterdam and Copenhagen, new anti-politics movements are on the rise in the south, born out of frustration with all &apos;&quot;political elites&quot;, whether national or European."], "title": "What can save the European Union?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/10/what-can-save-the-european-union", "tags": ["European Union", "European elections", "Europe", "World news", "France", "Beppe Grillo", "Marine Le Pen", "Geert Wilders", "UK Independence party (Ukip)", "Politics", "Euro", "Economics", "Euro", "European monetary union", "Business", "European commission", "Austerity"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-10T23:05:44Z", "article": "He is usually associated in the public mind with beautifully tailored, if somewhat expensive, suits, but Sir Paul Smith, fashion designer to the stars, is expected to be announced as a winner of a competition to design the UK pavilion at the 2015 World Fair in Milan. Smith is one of a team, led by artist Wolfgang Buttress, which has proposed a design in which the UK&apos;s pavilion will be a virtual beehive, in order to &quot;highlight the plight of the honeybee&quot;. In the words of the proposal, visitors to the World Fair will walk through an orchard and a wildflower meadow before entering the hive, which will &quot;pulsate, buzz and glow according to signals from a real hive&quot;. The success of the idea against seven rival designs is expected to be announced next Sunday, according to trade bible Architects&apos; Journal, although the government&apos;s trade and investment arm, UKTI, declined to comment. The best-known &quot;World Expo&quot; was held in 1851 at the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London, under the title the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations. The aspiration \u2013 to allow nations to promote their design, commercial and industrial innovation every five years \u2013 remains the same. Last week, however, the 2015 event became mired in controversy when a senior manager for Milan&apos;s Expo 2015 trade fair was arrested with six business people and politicians. Edmondo Bruti Liberati, a Milan prosecutor, reportedly said that the suspects were taped by police making suspected attempts to offer bribes to secure contracts for next year&apos;s fair. At the last world fair in Shanghai, Britain won the award for the finest pavilion for a structure which became known as the Dandelion, for its radiating sprays of rods. The pavilion, designed by Thomas Heatherwick, attracted eight million visitors over six months in 2010 and was regarded as among the top attractions at an exhibition that attracted more than 70 million, a record number of visitors. The 2015 proposal, in which Smith is involved, is said by its designers to &quot;explore the life of the bee colony through an immersive sensory experience \u2013 a beautiful and profound encounter leaving visitors with a lasting flavour of the British landscape&quot;.

There was an ambush at a home affairs cabinet committee chaired by Nick Clegg where Gove and other grandees made an unusual appearance even though the item was not on the agenda. Then there were orchestrated leaks to the Sun and the Daily Mail: Clegg blocks tougher knife sentences. The degree of annoyance can be measured by the Observer story about Gove&apos;s emergency funding for free schools paid from the school places budget. It looked like payback. The justice secretary, Chris Grayling, wants a mandatory prison sentence of six months, regardless of circumstances, for anyone convicted for a second time of possessing a knife. It is a Tory classic. Shortly after the horrific stabbing of the Leeds teacher Ann Maguire, it says: &quot;We are getting tough on crime.&quot; Who could be in favour of knives? The plan speaks to swing voters who crave simple solutions, which is why Labour is tiptoeing around this issue, and may do the wrong thing if there is a vote this week on the rebel Tory amendment to the criminal justice and courts bill. It makes Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats look weak and defensive. Nevertheless, Grayling and Gove are posturing. In Grayling&apos;s cabinet write-round letter, he gave no evidence for his proposal. In Scotland, prison seems to have worsened reoffending. Few people would be affected, but that is no reason for injustice. What of the young gang members put under pressure to carry knives for their elders? What of the fearful person carrying a knife in self-defence? Why employ judges if not to fit sentences to crimes? All parties become prone to pre-election simplicities (look at Labour&apos;s energy price freeze and rent controls). Yes, the usually sensible Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Met commissioner, supported Grayling&apos;s notion. But no senior serving police officer has ever publicly called for lighter sentences. Tougher sentences are always the police&apos;s answer because they are responsible for the difficult but more effective alternative \u2013 catching and convicting more people. They have a dog in this fight. Meanwhile, Grayling, Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May \u2013 let&apos;s name names here \u2013 are failing to implement properly the &quot;Cardiff model&quot; of violence prevention, a policy that cuts knife crime dramatically. There is real evidence that this works, unlike Grayling&apos;s burp. Three Tory ministers have been too slow in delivering a clear coalition commitment that will save young lives. Policy should be about delivery, not just design.Before Labour subcontracts its thinking to a committee of tabloid newspaper editors, it should remember that the evidence for the Cardiff model was first gathered for its health secretary Alan Johnson. The study found that the policy cut violent crime by 35%. The latest evidence shows even better results: hospital admissions owing to violence are down by 42% where the model is applied. The Cardiff model is the brainchild of Jonathan Shepherd, a professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery who was fed up with stitching together slashed faces on a Friday and Saturday night. He gave police anonymised accident and emergency data that allowed them to target violent hotspots. He went on to explore the impact of CCTV and plastic glass. The Cardiff model not only reduces violence, but it also gives us the real picture of the problem. Many fights and injuries, including serious ones, are not reported to the police: astonishingly 13% of shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, are estimated to go unreported. The data allows police to go on tracking changing hotspots, and to identify the instruments used in violence so they can tailor prevention (such as metal detectors for knives). Shepherd&apos;s data collection in Cardiff costs about \u00a35,000 a year but leads to \u00a3800,000 in NHS and justice savings alone (disregarding the benefits to victims). There are few better cost-benefit ratios: less crime for less public spending. The scheme has attracted attention as far afield as Amsterdam, Milwaukee and Cape Town. It so clearly made sense that the coalition backed it in the 2010 agreement, promising to &quot;make hospitals share non-confidential information with police so they know where gun and knife crime is happening and can target stop-and-search in gun and knife crime hotspots&quot;. Its UK rollout probably helps account for the fall in violence. Nevertheless, an audit in 2012 found that only a third of A&amp;E departments were implementing the Cardiff model. The next audit is due later this year. Practitioners believe there is still a long way to go \u2013 perhaps half of all emergency departments are applying it now. How do we account for this failure by two governments to deliver a non- ideological policy with clear advantages? Prevention is less sexy than punishment. The policy also suffers from a time-honoured Whitehall problem: one department (health) has to deliver changes that serve other departments&apos; objectives (home and justice). Joining up government is what cabinet committees are meant to do. But Grayling appears to be more interested in blaming others for a problem than solving it. Hotspot policing prevents crime: no arrests, no blame-game accusations, no cuts and bruises, no deaths, no punishment. How boring! If poor Grayling proposed to legislate for that, he would never get his headlines in the Sun or the Daily Mail.", "sentences": ["The scheme has attracted attention as far afield as Amsterdam, Milwaukee and Cape Town."], "title": "There is a way to cut knife crime \u2013 the Tories just aren't delivering it | Chris Huhne", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/11/way-cut-knife-crime-tories-delivering", "tags": ["Knife crime", "Crime", "Conservatives", "Liberal Democrats", "Politics", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-12T10:24:48Z", "article": "It is not everyone&apos;s idea of a weekend Euro-break: a conference in the sprawling maze of parliamentary buildings in Strasbourg to debate the virtues of European democracy. Yet they came in their thousands \u2013 more than 8,000 young people from 28 member states \u2013 to celebrate the European Union and share ideas for its future. The turnout at the three-day European Youth Event could mean one of two things: either there is genuine affection and enthusiasm for Europe&apos;s democratic institutions among some of its younger citizens, or 20-something Europeans have far too much time on their hands. Inside the stuffy assembly rooms or outside among fluttering flags and cutouts of Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy, presidents of the European commission and council respectively, they quiz ministers, simulate climate catastrophe and learn international sign language. Most speak with enthusiasm about what the EU has done for their country and with optimism about the future. &quot;Europe allows you to learn from your mistakes,&quot; says L\u00e9a, 27, from Belgium. &quot;In my country we have health insurance and an education system which we don&apos;t have everywhere. Europe has to intervene, in order to avoid what happened in Greece.&quot; Adam Sebesta, secretary general of the Pan-European Union in Slovakia, says: &quot;Slovakia is a conservative society but we are very much in favour of the European Union. We love that we can cross borders and view it as essential for peace. &quot;We have been very happy with the introduction of the euro, it has given us the chance to compete with the Czech Republic and our other neighbouring countries.&quot; It is natural to expect that people prepared to give up a spring weekend for Europe will tend to approve of things European. Research by the British Future thinktank shows that young people in Britain also want to stay in the EU, and are significantly more pro-European than their elders. &quot;Some issues can only be tackled at the European level,&quot; says John Lisney, 27, a Brit who works in Brussels for the League of Young Voters in Europe. He names climate change and youth unemployment as the two issues where the EU can make the most difference. It is perhaps unsurprising that youth unemployment is the focus of many of the debates here. At the end of 2013 more than 23% of Europe&apos;s under-25s were unemployed, double the proportion of older generations. The European Youth Forum is asking MEPs to commit before the European elections to proposals including stronger legislation on internships, an ombudsman to represent youth rights and the implementation of a youth guarantee to tackle unemployment. More than 200 MEP candidates  have already signed up. It is clear that the youth at the conference have taken advantage of the mobility that the EU offers them. &quot;This is the Erasmus generation. Welcome!&quot; says Simona Pronckute, from Fraternit\u00e9 2020, an initiative that develops exchange programmes within the EU. Most famous among these is the Erasmus study exchange programme, which offers students grants to spend a year at a European university. There is also Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs, a business exchange programme. Stefan K\u00f6ppl, 27, an Austrian former strategy consultant, is participating in the latter in Portugal, where he lives with his Polish wife. &quot;Erasmus has been one of Europe&apos;s brightest ideas of the last century. I have a host entrepreneur here in Portugal, and I am also doing a PhD in corporate evaluation on the side. &quot;He gets my ideas and passion, and I gain his contacts and knowledge,&quot; says K\u00f6ppl. &quot;I&apos;d also like to point out that raising kids trilingually is maybe one of the latest European problems. &quot;From the Portuguese perspective, the EU made this country what it is. It has such a large number of highways and roundabouts and highway roads. For the Polish, they now have opportunities that they did not 10 years ago. All of my wife&apos;s friends are launching their own businesses. Poland will be the first example of how European integration worked \u2013 even if they didn&apos;t use the euro.&quot; Multiple events are focused on the need for more democracy and participation in the EU. The attendees are keen to participate and learn about how they can influence European institutions. In the corridors, groups are competing at the boardgame Eurocracy, which is touring the EU to encourage participation in the elections. Players represent political parties and must navigate the structure of the institutions to become president of the union. Jaap Hoeksma, the inventor of the game and a philosopher of law from Amsterdam, says that when Edward Heath saw Eurocracy he said: &quot;You bastard! You&apos;ve turned my life&apos;s work into a game!&quot; But Hoeksma says the game has a serious objective: to help voters understand how the EU works and to debate why it matters. &quot;The European Union is more than the free-trade market that David Cameron says it is. It is a new way of democracy. It is a game and we must learn to play it.&quot; Five ideas to revitalise Europe 1) The European citizens&apos; initiative  Introduced with the aim of increasing direct democracy within the EU, the European citizens&apos; initiative came into force in 2012. It gives power to citizens to call upon the European commission to create specific legal acts, if they can gather 1m signatures from at least seven member states. &quot;Don&apos;t be put off by the threshold,&quot; says the MEP Peter Jahr. In theory it gives citizens a power equivalent to the European parliament and council. Initiatives registered so far call for action on vivisection, ecocide (the mass destruction of ecosystems) and media pluralism. In March, Right2Water, a group that calls for universal access and non-privatisation of water, became the first initiative to receive a formal positive response from the commission. It committed to conducting a public consultation and increasing efforts to implement water legislation. The programme&apos;s impact will then be tested at the delivery stage. 2) The youth guarantee  With the European youth unemployment rate above 23% \u2013 and soaring well above 50% in some countries \u2013 EU institutions are waking up to the need to take action on a continental level. The youth guarantee would require national governments to ensure that all people under 25 are offered a good job, apprenticeship, trainee scheme or further education course within four months of leaving employment or education. Countries are currently developing their implementation plans and the European commission has committed \u20ac6bn (\u00a34.9bn) to the plan, with an additional \u20ac16bn in European structural funds set aside for youth employment projects. The cost of inaction, however, would be much higher: the loss of earnings and taxes would be equivalent to \u20ac153bn, or 1.2% of GDP, according to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. 3) Transnational voting lists  Should the world&apos;s biggest transnational election have transnational candidates? European political parties, such as the Green party or the European People&apos;s party, work as federations of national political parties and so have no power to campaign themselves. MEPs are elected as representatives of national political parties to act with others in the parliament. But Andrew Duff, the Liberal Democrat MEP for the east of England, has argued that giving citizens the power to elect pan-European candidates would make the parliament more accountable and improve voter turnout.

They argue that the Ukraine crisis demonstrates the need for greater capabilities to protect more vulnerable states on European borders. They believe that a European army would act as a deterrent to outside forces such as Russia that have the potential to affect European trade and resources. Its proponents also use Libya as an example, arguing that a no-fly zone could have been implemented much sooner if done at a European level.", "sentences": ["Jaap Hoeksma, the inventor of the game and a philosopher of law from Amsterdam, says that when Edward Heath saw Eurocracy he said: &quot;You bastard!"], "title": "EU enthusiasts share their Euro vision at Strasbourg youth conference", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/12/strasbourg-european-youth-event", "tags": ["European Union", "Europe", "World news", "European commission", "Young people", "Herman Van Rompuy", "European elections", "Politics", "Edward Heath", "David Cameron", "Liberal Democrats", "Crimea", "Ukraine", "Lithuania", "Russia", "Libya", "Portugal", "Poland", "Slovakia", "Greece", "Belgium"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-13T05:00:00Z", "article": "Positivus, Salacgriva, Latvia 18-20 July Situated on the Gulf of Riga, Positivius has a whimsical feel and an impressive line up: this year Elbow, Kraftwerk and Anna Calvi are some of the names on the list.

The celebrations of Benfica and Sevilla following their semi-final victories were two of the most impassioned displays of emotion in the competition&apos;s recent history, jubilation clear within the two sets of players who meet in Turin under the watch of ghosts from glories past. Sevilla&apos;s first full season under Unai Emery began disastrously but has turned into a significant success, the Andalusian club on course for a fifth-place finish in La Liga despite sitting bottom after five matches. Two hundred miles across Iberia and Benfica have the chance to secure a clean sweep of silverware in a campaign for the Portuguese club that will be forever remembered for the passing of Eus\u00e9bio as well as the trophy haul. Europe&apos;s premiere club tournament does not roll into Lisbon for another week and a half but for the red half of the city the Champions League can wait. Now, following a remarkable year under Jorge Jesus, they have another opportunity to defy the curse of Bela Guttmann, who allegedly vowed with Mercutio-esque foresight when acrimoniously leaving Benfica in 1962 that they would not win a European trophy for the next 100 years. Guttmann&apos;s imprecation has haunted Benfica ever since he departed. After winning the European Cup twice during the Hungarian&apos;s reign, Benfica have lost seven finals in the last 52 years, most recently falling to Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s Chelsea in Amsterdam, when Branislav Ivanovic&apos;s late effort broke Eagles hearts. Eus\u00e9bio once prayed at Guttmann&apos;s grave in Vienna in an attempt to lift the curse, yet to this day a major European title has evaded them. Benfica, though, may not have a better chance to end the barren run for some time. Jesus, who has been strongly linked with a move away from the club this summer, has already seen his team wrap up the Portuguese title by a seven-point margin, also adding the League Cup to their trophy cabinet, with the Portuguese Cup final to come against Rio Ave. They will be without suspended duo Eduardo Salvio and Enzo P\u00e9rez against Sevilla, while Silvio is out with a knee injury and Ljubomir Fejsa a doubt with a foot problem. Benfica have a solid central defensive partnership of Luis\u00e3o and Ezequiel Garay and ample attacking talents including Nicol\u00e1s Gait\u00e1n and Lazar Markovic, although the latter could miss the final through suspension, with Uefa set to make a late decision on whether to allow him to play following a yellow card received post-match in the semi-final win over Juventus. &quot;We&apos;re stronger than last year but that doesn&apos;t give us an edge over Sevilla,&quot; said Jesus. &quot;We&apos;ve been working on this project for five years, we have become stronger and our work has been rewarded. We know Sevilla are a strong opponent, they have great history in this competition. &quot;When you&apos;re prepared for a final, which is the case this year because we were in the final last year, you feel more secure. It doesn&apos;t create great difficulties at an emotional level, the more decisive moments you go through the more confidence you have.&quot; Emery and Sevilla have been on a journey of their own, catapulted into the final in dramatic circumstances following St\u00e9phane Mbia&apos;s header in the fourth minute of injury time against Valencia. Mbia, on loan from QPR, sent Sevilla into dreamland at the Mestalla as Emery raced down the touchline he once prowled as the home manager. Sevilla, who won the Europa League in 2006 and 2007 under Juande Ramos, will be without the suspended Jairo Samperio, while Denis Cheryshev and Sebasti\u00e1n Crist\u00f3foro are injured and Vitolo is struggling with a hamstring problem. Their hopes rest largely on the Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic, a man who has embraced the city&apos;s identity during his time there since 2011 and who has been linked with a summer move to Real Madrid. Sevilla have other players who can hurt Benfica, including Kevin Gameiro and the 27-year-old striker Carlos Bacca, who was a bus conductor before turning professional aged 23, but Rakitic is the key man. Emery said: &quot;It is just another stage in the process. It is a dream to be here, now we have to enjoy it. We have to enjoy this moment, everyone is hoping for a positive result for the work we have put in this season. It will be wonderful to finish the season with a trophy, but just being here is fantastic, it&apos;s been a long journey.&quot;", "sentences": ["After winning the European Cup twice during the Hungarian&apos;s reign, Benfica have lost seven finals in the last 52 years, most recently falling to Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s Chelsea in Amsterdam, when Branislav Ivanovic&apos;s late effort broke Eagles hearts."], "title": "Europa League final: Benfica seek to banish old curse against Sevilla | James Riach", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/14/europa-league-final-benfica-banish-old-curse-sevilla", "tags": ["Europa League", "Football", "Sport", "Benfica", "Sevilla"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-15T09:59:33Z", "article": "     Manchester United will delay naming Louis van Gaal as their new manager until after the weekend to respect Holland&apos;s preparations for their friendly against Ecuador on Saturday.

Pfizer, which has proposed a \u00a363bn takeover of the UK business, intends to use the AstraZeneca deal to relocate its tax base to the UK. The move is designed to move away from the US&apos;s higher rate of corporation tax, but US Democratic senators angered by the strategy have expressed determination to close this legal loophole. Soriot told the Guardian on Thursday: &quot;The risk is that if it turns into a controversy our own company would be impacted by it. Even if we were to agree a [takeover] deal, it takes eight to 10 months to close it. &quot;If this controversy leads to a delay, you have to remember the shareholders of Pfizer can still vote no. Imagine we go through this entire process of waiting, a lot of anxiety in our employees&apos; minds, lots of distraction, , potential controversy surrounding us and in the end the deal doesn&apos;t happen and we are left flailing in the wind.&quot; Soriot also hit back at Pfizer&apos;s pledge to ringfence work on important medicines and criticised the US group&apos;s plan to split the combined business into three separate divisions. &quot;It&apos;s all very well to say we will ringfence, but what does it mean, ringfencing? You have to understand precisely how you would do that. The model where you would split the company in three pieces I don&apos;t think would work at all for our business.&quot; He pointed to AstraZeneca&apos;s MedImmune arm in Cambridge, which specialises in immunology \u2013 coming up with drugs for immune diseases and cancer \u2013 and designing antibodies for cancer, respiratory and other diseases. &quot;It&apos;s impossible \u2013 you can&apos;t split MedImmune into three pieces.&quot; The proposed takeover has sparked deep-seated concerns within the science community and at Westminster about the impact on UK research. David Cameron has said he is not satisfied with Pfizer&apos;s pledges to protect jobs and research, while business secretary Vince Cable has refused to rule out intervention in the bid although he admits it would be &quot;tricky&quot; for the government to act. The chair of the House of Commons science select committee, Andrew Miller, wrote to the science minister, David Willetts on Thursday to express his growing concerns about the takeover. His letter was sent just hours after the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, signed a decree giving the Paris government new powers to block foreign takeover bids for companies deemed &quot;strategic&quot;. A large part of one of France&apos;s leading companies, Alstom, is currently the target of another large US corporation, GE. EU competition chief Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, however, said the UK government has not approached him so far over a change to British law on a &quot;public interest&quot; test that might be used to protect AstraZeneca against Pfizer&apos;s bid. Soriot admitted that if AstraZeneca were a French business, the government would be playing a much bigger part in the negotiations. The French-born Australian, who has led AstraZeneca for 18 months, said: &quot;There would be a massive controversy for sure \u2013 just look at the controversy that is happening around Alstom.&quot; However, he refused to ask the British government to intervene to help protect the UK company, which is responsible for 2% of the country&apos;s exports, saying: &quot;Every country has to develop its own national policy.&quot; Speculation is now mounting that Pfizer is close to coming back with a higher offer intended to force AstraZeneca&apos;s board to the negotiating table. Soriot, however, said that price was not the only factor to consider: &quot;We&apos;re very much aware of our fiduciary duty and we&apos;ll make sure we consider an offer that is a good offer for our shareholders.&quot;But some people read from this that we are ready to sell, the deal will happen and it&apos;s only a question of price. Absolutely not. This deal is not inevitable. &quot;We have a strategy that works, we have the critical mass to succeed, we are one of the largest pharmaceutical companies \u2013 how big do you need to be?&quot; Pfizer boss Ian Read spent a second day touring City investors on Thursday to press the case for his bid.  Soriot was meanwhile attempting to woo his shareholders \u2013 many of whom are also big Pfizer investors \u2013 by talking up AstraZeneca&apos;s cancer pipeline. He said the value of the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker&apos;s pipeline will crystallise in the company&apos;s share price long before 2023. By that date the company expects a 75% uplift in annual revenues to more than $45bn. Soriot pointed to other companies that have turned themselves around \u2013 such as Bristol Myers-Squibb in the US. Analysts believe Pfizer will raise its proposal to \u00a353-\u00a355 a share from \u00a350 two weeks ago. One large investor said: &quot;The ball is now in Pfizer&apos;s court to see if they can find an offer which brings Astra to the table. They can go hostile, though that is risky. &quot;We have indicated that we think [AstraZeneca] should consider, talking but there needs to be an inducement to talk and in that sense it&apos;s Pfizer decision.&quot; AstraZeneca has not suffered any setbacks through drugs failing in development in the last eight months. Soriot noted that lung drug AZD9291, which new data shows shrank tumours in over half of patients, the cancer immunotherapy PD-L1 treatment, and asthma medicines benralizumab and tralokinumab, have all been engineered in Cambrige. &quot;We are very much rooted in science in this country.&quot; AstraZeneca&apos;s defence was strengthened by the release of promising clinical data ahead of a key cancer US conference, which Soriot, a biologist, plans to attend. He reminded his shareholders that they would receive cash and shares in the new company, which is why its strategy and integration are crucial. &quot;Would it be a strategy that is science led with an investment in R&amp;D or would it be a strategy of: we cut costs and we maximise short-term cashflow?&quot; Meanwhile, research by Amsterdam-based AntWorks shows that Pfizer is already dominant in over 80% of the therapeutic areas of both companies combined. Given the vast overlap, &quot;it is unlikely that AstraZeneca&apos;s R&amp;D departments will feel secure about their futures.&quot; Additional reporting by Sean Farrell", "sentences": ["&quot;Would it be a strategy that is science led with an investment in R&amp;D or would it be a strategy of: we cut costs and we maximise short-term cashflow?&quot; Meanwhile, research by Amsterdam-based AntWorks shows that Pfizer is already dominant in over 80% of the therapeutic areas of both companies combined."], "title": "AstraZeneca at risk from Pfizer tax avoidance plans, says company chief", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/15/atsrazeneca-chief-steps-up-attack-on-pfizer", "tags": ["Pfizer", "AstraZeneca", "Pharmaceuticals industry", "Business", "David Cameron", "Vince Cable", "Politics", "Tax", "Money", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-16T14:35:52Z", "article": "It is now a dozen years since play-offs became a part of the Premiership rugby landscape. Time enough, surely, for everyone to grow accustomed to the concept and plan accordingly. Not if you study the past fortunes of teams who have topped the table in the 22-game regular season. Only on four occasions out of 11 have the league leaders become the champions of England. Which is why no one involved with Saracens is assuming anything before Saturday&apos;s capital-splitting semi-final against Harlequins. Yes it would be nice if Saracens \u2013 having finished nine points clear of their rivals \u2013 received something tangible for winning what Australians like to call &quot;the minor premiership&quot; but all concerned have known for months the domestic season does not end until 31 May. The trick is to act and think smart. Not to start completely afresh, necessarily, but to clear the head. Within the camp, a conscious decision has been taken to avoid weary phrases such as: &quot;It&apos;s been a long season&quot; because of the subliminal negativity it fosters. &quot;It&apos;s amazing where your mind will take you if you let it go there,&quot; says Philip Morrow, Saracens&apos; head of strength and conditioning. Mentally and physically, his squad seem appreciably sharper than this time last season, when they were beaten in the semis of the Premiership and the Heineken Cup. &quot;We understand that what we&apos;ve done in the Premiership now counts for diddly squat,&quot; says Mark McCall, their director of rugby. &quot;We&apos;ve progressed a lot this season and can reel off loads of stats but we know it doesn&apos;t matter. We&apos;ve just got a very difficult game against Quins.&quot; That simple acceptance of play-off reality is crucial. In past years sides such as Gloucester \u2013 who finished top of the table three times in six seasons between 2003 and 2008 yet never won a trophy \u2013 simply could not get their heads around the sprint finish aspect. Wasps, in contrast, used to love it. Their fitness trainer Craig White was the architect of a strategy which saw them train like men possessed, wearing bin bags to make them sweat even more, when everyone else was tapering down. Wasps&apos;s players felt it gave them an edge and took everyone by surprise on an annual basis. Times, though, have subtly changed. Morrow is extremely familiar with White&apos;s end-of-season blueprint but believes today&apos;s increasingly physical game is best navigated via intense, carefully tailored bursts throughout the year. Saracens, unusually, train together only three times per week \u2013 as opposed to most clubs&apos; four \u2013 and do not bother with a team run 24 hours before a game, preferring to give their players the day off. They also routinely rotate their players and identify booster weeks in which to do extra work on building an individual&apos;s muscle or fitness. &quot;We don&apos;t look at the pre-season as a time for physical development and the season as a time just to maintain it,&quot; says Morrow, previously involved with Ulster and the Ireland national team. &quot;We try to build throughout the year. We don&apos;t want guys to be losing muscle ... we think they can get stronger and more powerful during the year.&quot; It is not unusual, he says, for some players&apos; to put on 4kg of lean muscle in a season. The defence coach Paul Gustard reckons the club are also reaping increasing rewards from not flogging their players with old-school regularity. &quot;We don&apos;t have the same people playing every week, like Wasps did in their pomp and Leicester used to do,&quot; he says. &quot;Our rotation policy has definitely helped us keep people fit. As a player I always fell foul of playing a lot of rugby, getting injured around Christmas and not having a long time off to allow my body to repair. Across rugby in general there&apos;s more awareness about the importance of protecting your assets. If you look at the size of some of the guys they&apos;re crazy big. It&apos;s frightening.&quot; So what went wrong last season when Saracens folded against Toulon and Northampton within weeks of each other? It depends to whom you talk. The England centre Brad Barritt reckons &quot;a bit of complacency&quot; crept in; Saracens, then as now, were hosting the Saints semi-final on their own artificial surface in Hendon which they fondly imagined was virtually impregnable. McCall suspects the Northampton defeat was a hangover from the Toulon disappointment. &quot;We&apos;d just lost the semi-final to Toulon and the sense of what-could-have-been affected us more than we thought.&quot; Morrow feels the untimely injuries which had removed Barritt and Jacques Burger also played a crucial part, while Gustard, interestingly, believes the squad were not as unified as they are now: &quot;We felt we weren&apos;t all in synch with each other as much as we could have been. It wasn&apos;t like there were massive fractures or disharmony but we weren&apos;t quite on the same hymn sheet when it came to the big games. A year on we&apos;ve learned what it takes to win them. Results have shown we&apos;re not too far off the right formula.&quot; The remarkable 46-6 European semi-final win over Clermont Auvergne certainly bears him out.

The Holland captain suffered the problem in the 89th minute of the Champions League last-16 tie, after his goals overturned a 2-0 deficit to the Greek champions from the opening leg \u2013 putting United through to the quarter-finals. The Dutchman was subsequently out for six weeks, not returning for United until a 66th-minute substitution in the 1-0 defeat to Sunderland on 3 May. On Thursday Van Persie joined the Dutch squad led by Louis van Gaal at their Hoenderloo training camp and took part in his first two sessions \u2013 one in the morning and the second, more intense, behind closed doors in the afternoon. Despite Van Gaal \u2013 who may finally be announced as United&apos;s manager on Sunday or Monday \u2013 believing that Van Persie is not yet 100% fit, the 30-year-old appeared sharp in the morning session. He trained alongside team-mates, including Aston Villa&apos;s Ron Vlaar and Dirk Kuyt, the former Liverpool forward now at Fenerbahce, in the grounds of the Golden Tulip Hotel, where the Dutch team&apos;s training camp is\u00a0based. Yet later Van Persie wore bandages and strapping on his knee and admitted to not yet being quite match fit. &quot;I&apos;m feeling good,&quot; he\u00a0said. &quot;Mentally I&apos;m fresh. If you play a full season you can be a little bit tired at the end of the season. But I&apos;m fresh, the knee is fine as well so I&apos;m looking forward to it.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m 100%. It&apos;s just that I need a full game now. We have three friendlies to play [and] my last game against Southampton [for United] was 67 minutes so hopefully I can play a bit more.&quot; The trio of warm-up games will allow the striker to shake off any lingering rustiness before next month&apos;s World Cup. These start on Saturday with Ecuador at the Amsterdam Arena, before flying to Portugal on Tuesday for warm-weather\u00a0training. Holland return home to play Ghana in Rotterdam on 31 May and Wales in Amsterdam four days later. Van Persie was a relaxed figure in Hoenderloo but did admit to anguish about the knee injury that he suffered so soon after having scoring the hat-trick against Olympiakos. &quot;Yeah I went from high to a low but that&apos;s how football sometimes goes,&quot; he\u00a0said. The Manchester United star&apos;s importance to Holland and Van Gaal for the finals in Brazil was illustrated on Tuesday when the coach admitted discussing a possible switch in formation for the World Cup team with his \u00a0captain. Van Gaal&apos;s default is 4\u20113\u20113 yet he has consulted Van Persie on potentially playing in a\u00a03\u20115\u20112 . &quot;I discussed changing the formation with Robin as I talk about these matters with my captain,&quot; Van Gaal said. &quot;He was here in Holland to recover from his injury and he went to games with me. I spoke to him about the way of playing, my ideas, and we discussed it while we were watching the games.&quot; Van Persie has indeed been a regular watcher of Dutch football with Van Gaal but he would not be drawn on how Holland will line up in Brazil. Their difficult World Cup group features the holders, Spain, whom Holland will play first in Salvador on 13 June, before moving to Porto Alegre to face Australia five days later, before the final match of the phase, which is in S\u00e3o Paulo against\u00a0Chile. Yet asked how Holland may line up for these games, Van Persie said: &quot;It&apos;s a difficult question \u2013 you will see how we will play.&quot; Regarding the potential change in Holland&apos;s shape, he said: &quot;I can&apos;t comment on that, maybe later \u2013 you will see.

A blond boy comes running up to his father to show him the butterfly that&apos;s just landed on his shoulder. It&apos;s as though I&apos;m in some sort of pastoral dream sequence\u2026 Eventually, Michel emerges from the kitchen in a vest, chef&apos;s trousers and clogs. He shakes our hands vigorously and pours us two icy, homemade elderflower cordials. &quot;Welcome to our island,&quot; he says, proudly, before heading back to the stove. The &quot;island&quot; Michel Mulder and his wife Sofie Sleumer have created is 55 miles south-west of Paris, in the centre of Le Perche, a conservation area in Basse-Normandie (southern Normandy). The Latin name for the area, Sylva Pertica, refers to the forests of oaks, beech and ash that once defined the landscape. Today, remnants of the forest can still be found on high ground. Between the trees, sunken paths hollowed out by centuries of hooves and boots lead to hedge-fringed meadows of wheat, corn, barley and rapeseed.     Sophie and Michel, owners of D'une Ile. Photograph: Will Venning    Le Perche was granted &quot;le parc naturel r\u00e9gional&quot; status in 1998 and, for the past 15 years, has served as a weekend retreat for urban escapees \u2013 Parisians who have been steadily resurrecting the area&apos;s dilapidated farm houses and chateaux. Outside of France, however, the region remains virtually unknown. D&apos;une \u00cele, two miles away from tiny R\u00e9melard, opened in April 2012. This enclave of medieval woodsmen cottages and a restaurant is tucked away at the end of a country lane, past a pond, a cherry orchard and a wildflower meadow. The owners, a beautiful, creative young couple from Amsterdam, took over the lease from Michel&apos;s father last year. They run the hotel almost completely single-handedly. When I arrive with my boyfriend for a couple of nights in early summer, all but one of the nine cottages have been newly refurbished, and all are fully booked. Outside, the traditional, two-storey stone buildings are covered in patchy peach stucco. Inside, each has been uniquely furnished by Sofie, who trained as a designer and interior decorator. The walls have been stripped back, the exposed stoneware whitewashed. Industrial lighting is strung out over the original 16th-century beams. Rustic wooden chairs are juxtaposed with 50s enamel-topped sideboards. All the furniture is vintage and most is available to purchase from the owners. Unusual found objects \u2013 glass conicals, turtle shells, a collection of botanical specimens in jars of formaldehyde \u2013 are positioned artfully throughout the rooms. The Dutch artist Just van der Loos exhibits his work here, too. He transforms found objects \u2013 a trumpet, a safari hard hat \u2013 into light installations that add a playful note to the rustic charm of the interiors. Jewellery by Martine Viergever, photographs by Isabel Nabuurs, pottery from Gerrit-Jan van Ham, poetry from Martijn den Ouden and music from Daan Hofman is also sold.     A retro roll-top in the bathroom. Photograph: Will Venning    Only one of the cottages is self-catering: the rest of the guests are served breakfast and dinner in the informal restaurant. On our first evening, we gather with around 20 guests \u2013 Parisian couples, Dutch visitors and a Canadian family \u2013 on the mismatched vintage garden furniture in the courtyard for seafood linguine with lobster sauce and a glass of ros\u00e9 gris. The cat sits on a bench beside us, enjoying the meal vicariously. To my delight, Sofie reveals that the following day R\u00e9melard will host its annual brocantes fair. After a breakfast of croissants, compote and coffee we meander through the normally sleepy village, which has been transformed into a flea market. Young and old are bargaining over old enamel pots, crockery, books and old magazines.     Remnants of a D'une Ile breakfast. Photograph: Will Venning    At lunchtime, we find a bakery in the main square that sells the baguette du Perche \u2013 a speciality of the region. This crusty, fragrant bread is made from locally grown grain by local bakers. Each loaf bears an official seal of the region. We pick up a stick, a bottle of local cider, some wild boar saucisson and a chunk of homemade cake from a stallholder and take them back to D&apos;une Ile for a picnic on the central lawn where Artus, the demanding dog, is imploring guests to throw his slobbery stick. After lunch, I read my book in the shade of a tree. Nearby, Michel is teaching the Canadian kids a riff on his guitar. Fat caterpillars fall out of the branches above on to the pages of my book. Besides its bread, Le Perche is renowned for its musty manoirs, many of which are designated historical monuments and open to the public. The next day, we drive past 10km of poppy-edged fields, via the village of Noc\u00e9 \u2013 seemingly uninhabited but with an abundance of red geraniums \u2013 to the Manoir de Courboyer, a fortified estate built at the end of the 15th century. We reach the top of the turreted tower via a cool, spiral staircase and explore the simple rooms completely undisturbed. That afternoon, back at &quot;home&quot;, we pass through the gate at the back of the central lawn and take a steep path directly through the woodland that rises up behind the property. You could happily get lost in the woods for hours, but the lure of the local wine list and Michel&apos;s home cooking soon has us scuttling back down the hill for supper. After the meal, we share some chocolate and freshly plucked cherries with a couple who discovered the hotel on a Dutch design blog. Their two-year-old boy is safely tucked up in their cottage. The smaller guests who are still awake dangle off the trapeze in the nearby barn as their parents sit in the glow of the peachy cottages. A chorus of frogs starts up in the background. We hear of the future plans for D&apos;une \u00cele: for a new suite with glass walls and a bathtub built into the floor of the living room; another new room with a huge antique window; the placing of seven antique bathtubs in the orchard. &quot;So when it&apos;s hot, you can put on a swimsuit, order a glass of cider, take a book and have a nice cool bath under the apple trees,&quot; says Sofie.

But in the Netherlands, also battered by the record deluge but relatively unscathed, an ongoing multibillion-euro programme continues to reshape the watery nation, with none of the political storm whipped up in the UK. Hard-won reclaimed land \u2013 polders \u2013 are being given back to rivers and meanders are being cut back into flood plains, all as part of a back-to-nature approach that is reversing centuries of battling against water, in favour of finding ways to live with it. The Netherlands is a land of waterways and a quarter is below sea level, with 60% of its people in flood-risk areas. There is deep experience of what it takes to deal with flooding, in both financial and human terms.  Jan Kant is the fourth generation of his family to farm the Noordwaard polder in the heart of the giant four-river delta than dominates the south of the Netherlands. \u201cI am attached to this area,\u201d he says simply. But, with his sons who now run the business, he is about to move away. The dykes protecting Kant&apos;s low-lying fields are about to be broken and the area flooded, to take 30cm off the river level that threatens the nearby town of Gorinchem.     The Noordwaard polder in Werkendam is one of the key areas of the national Room for the River project. Photograph: Courtesy Werry Crone/Noordwardpolder RR project    The intensification of downpours by climate change is the underlying reason and Kant is now philosophical about losing his farm: \u201cLiving in an area like this, we may have had to move someday anyway.\u201d Another 10 farmers and 24 other families are having to make way as the river takes possession of its flood plain once more. The project is the biggest of 34 \u201cRoom for the River\u201d (RR) projects across the Netherlands, costing \u20ac2.3bn (\u00a31.9bn) and set to finish in 2015.  But discussions with the locals began more than a decade ago, led by Raalf Gaastra, the stakeholder manager for the Noordwaard polder RR project. \u201cPeople have made their own choices: they can stay in an area that could now be flooded tomorrow, because they like the area, or they can leave,\u201d he says. Those who stay are helped to build new homes, raised on high mounds, those who don&apos;t are bought out at market rates. \u201cThe first discussion is not easy, but once one house has decided to go people start to follow,\u201d says Gaastra. Vic Gremmer, the local residents&apos; spokesman, is staying and moving to a new house. \u201cBeing forced to move so other people can keep their feet dry is acceptable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe key is to make us safe and compensate us properly.\u201d The disruption is enormous: new bridges, roads, pipes and repositioned dykes are all in construction, leaving great muddy tracks across the flat green and blue landscape. \u201cSometimes it feels like the work takes ages,\u201d says Gremmer. But the nature-lover is excited by the prospect of new waterworld and the ospreys it will support. \u201cI can&apos;t wait to see what it looks like.\u201d     A bridge site at the Noordwaard polder. Photograph: Courtesy Werry Crone/Noordwardpolder RR project    The Noordwaard polder is strikingly similar to the Somerset Levels in the south-west of England, down to the locals initial insistence that river dredging was the key. But Kant, Gremmer and the rest were eventually persuaded that annual dredging was not a sustainable solution. Visiting the Noordwaard polder, David Rooke, director of flood and coastal risk at the UK&apos;s Environment Agency, says: \u201cIt&apos;s exactly the same issue as the Somerset Levels, exactly the same. But [in England] there is not \u20ac2.3bn to solve the problem.\u201d Projects like Room for the River have also gone ahead in other countries, such as Germany and China. In England and Wales, which together have actually a 50% greater area of land below sea level than the Netherlands, the last Labour government began a similar project, called \u201cMaking room for water.\u201d &quot;But then there was a change of government and a change of policy,&quot; says Rooke. After the coalition cut annual flood defence spending by 25% on taking office in 2010. In the Hague, at the Rijkswaterstaat, the national water management agency which runs the Room for the River programme, director of safety Roeland Allewijn, says over \u20ac16bn has already committed for flood defences up to 2028. \u201cWe call this relatively short term. \u201cThere is huge political and public awareness that we need to spend a lot of money on this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is reasonably easy for us to get government spending on this.\u201d This stems back to the national disaster in February 1953, when a North Sea storm overwhelmed the coast and killed 1,850 Dutch people. The sea remains as major flood threat to the Netherlands and on the windy coast, not far from the major cities of Rotterdam and the Hague, a \u20ac75m government-backed experiment is taking place. A new crescent-shaped peninsula, 4 miles long, has been created just in front of the sandy beach. The idea is that rather than having to replenish the beach every year to protect the coast, the waves and currents will wash the 20m cubic metres of sand used to create the peninsula into place: the project is called the \u201csand motor\u201d.     The Sand Motor peninsula on 5 July 2011. Tonnes of sand was dumped in the sea on the coast near Ter Heijde to create a hook-shaped peninsula. It extended 1km into the sea and was 2km wide where it joined the shore. Photograph: Courtesy Joop van Houdt/Rijkswaterstaat    The new peninsula has already been stretched to 5.5 miles in its first two years, and has provided a new site for recreation including hunting for the fossil mammoth teeth hidden in the ice-age sand dredged from offshore. \u201cThere was not a big need to show a cost-benefit,\u201d says Jaap Flikweert, an engineer at Royal Haskoning DHV. \u201cThere was a lot of vision: it&apos;s very Dutch.\u201d Flikweert is now examining how the sand motor might be used in the UK, and has identified coastal locations off the low-lying counties of Lincolnshire and Suffolk, both places hammered by the winter&apos;s storms. Paul Cobbing, chief executive of the UK&apos;s community-led National Flood Forum, says the British approach is different: \u201cIn the UK, the cost-benefit analysis would have had to be foremost to get anyway near Treasury funding.\u201d The sand motor&apos;s primary aim is to guard against the rise in sea levels being driven by climate change, and global warming is always the first reason cited by Dutch engineers for the huge flood defence improvements being undertaken. There is no debate about its impact, according to Peter Glas, president of the Dutch Association of Regional Water Boards, the 23 elected bodies that raise \u20ac2.5bn a year in flood defence taxes and have defended communities for many centuries. \u201cI don&apos;t even enter into discussions about carbon dioxide,\u201d he says. \u201cI see sea level rising, I see the land falling and I see millions of people in need.\u201d Aidan Kerr, a flooding expert at the Association of British Insurers and formerly at the Environment Agency, does not see the same attitude in the UK, where environment secretary Owen Paterson is widely regarded as a climate sceptic. \u201cThere is concern about the extent to which climate change projections are being taken into account,\u201d he says. \u201cThe EA has done work on the impact of climate change. But this is not being taken into account as a benchmark for funding.\u201d     The Sand Motor peninsula as seen on 1 October 2013. Nature, as expected did its work, and spread around the sand, extending the area. Photograph: Courtesy Joop van Houdt/Rijkswaterstaat    Water Boards president Glas is also chairman of the local De Dommel water board in another part of the delta region. Here long, sinuous meanders have just been dug through fields to recreate the natural winding form of the Esse Stroom, slowing the rush of water towards populated areas downstream and creating more room for water. The Esse was part of the huge 1995 floods and closed the A2 motorway which runs from Amsterdam to Milan, causing over \u20ac6bn of economic damage.  The new meanders, and fields newly opened to floodwaters, account for about 6% of the total 150,000 hectare area of the De Dommel water board and will be able to store 20m tonnes of water. The EA in England has also restored meanders at Stockton-on-Tees and in Oxfordshire, but on a much smaller scale. Such back-to-nature projects, like another pilot scheme in north Somerset, challenge centuries of accepted wisdom that rivers must be straightened and water flow speeded up. \u201cIt can be a leap of faith for local communities,\u201d said Rooke, noting that the early results in Somerset look promising. Mark van de Wouw, hydrologist at the De Dommel waterboard, looks at the newly cut meanders in the Esse and says: \u201cIt is a small sacrifice to save a massive cost if a city floods downstream.\u201d Van de Woew visited No 10 Downing Street in February as part of a Dutch delegation that advised on the UK&apos;s flood response. \u201cThe biggest difference was a difference of culture. In the Netherlands, we have a totally different approach to the problem: people here expect to pay bills for flood defences.\u201d Flikweert agrees: \u201cFlooding in the UK is more difficult to treat because it is more diverse. So in the Netherlands you have a simpler problem with more money, compared to a more difficult problem with less money in the UK.\u201d", "sentences": ["The Esse was part of the huge 1995 floods and closed the A2 motorway which runs from Amsterdam to Milan, causing over \u20ac6bn of economic damage."], "title": "Taming the floods, Dutch-style", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/19/floods-dutch-britain-netherlands-climatechange", "tags": ["Flooding", "Environment Agency", "Climate change", "Rivers", "UK news", "Netherlands", "Europe", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-19T08:21:19Z", "article": "He exploded onto the literary scene with Trainspotting in 1993, and has been proudly in our faces ever since.

If Scotland does become independent, how do you think this will affect the arts?       The Government don&apos;t really care that much about Scotland, but are terrified that people in England will then say; no house of lords, city of London investment bankers, public school elites in the system of government, we&apos;ll have some of that! I&apos;d like the think the arts would have a higher profile in an indy Scotland, but that artists would be the sternest critics of that Government.              Glozboy    19 May 2014 11:43am  Will you be reprising your role as Mikey Forrester in Porno?       It&apos;s all down to John Hodge who would be doing the screenplay. I&apos;d never interfere by telling him that he has to include the Forrester character and have him shagging tons of fit young women. I wouldn&apos;t even think it.              PorkHunt    19 May 2014 3:07pm  Is the scene in Porno where Spud witnesses the abuse of the woman with shit in her tights, the most brutal you have written? I love your work though that was tough to get through!       I&apos;m not sure. You don&apos;t really think about them in that way while you&apos;re writing them. The rape scene in Marabou Stork Nightmares was brutal, but I only recognised it as such when I saw it performed on the stage. Before that it was just words on a page.              Tamzin Rollason    19 May 2014 4:26pm  For a while after reading Filth I couldn't read your work anymore. I felt degraded and filthy after reading it. Much as I love your work, for me, you went too far with that book. I'm curious about what knowledge understanding or experiences gave you the insights to write these characters? Do you have any regrets for giving &quot;life&quot; to such screwed-up types ?       I&apos;m sorry you felt like that Tamzin. I know that people internalise these things differently and the character was repellent and on a spiral which was stripping him of his humanity. I&apos;m interested in people when they are having a bad time, and the mechanisms by which we compound our problems with bad decision making. I think people can forgive darkness if they know the characters are groping for the light switch, so I don&apos;t regret bringing them to life.              Screamager    19 May 2014 9:02pm  So much to ask, but where to begin.. Around the time that the Bedroom Secrets of the Master Chefs' was published, there was an interview shown on Newsnight Review in that you mentioned that David Cameron would make a good PM. However, following the death of your friend Paul Reekie, following a letter on benefit cuts. Obviously, he wasn't the first as many others have taken their lives, or made homeless following the introduction of the bedroom tax. Looking back, or even since the benefit changes, do you support or regret what was said back in 2006. Also, if Trainspotting were to be written today, would it make a harsher read? Many thanks for your time       I think the Cameron thing was basically a wind up from one of my pals at the Telegraph. I think I actually said something like &apos;he can&apos;t be worse than Blair&apos; which was taken as an endorsement of him. He probably is worse, though it&apos;s not an important distinction. I think Trainspotting probably would be harsher today. It was about the first generation of the post war era who had experienced a zero employment economy, we&apos;ve had another two since who&apos;ve known nothing else.              WordontheLyre    19 May 2014 11:00pm  Ok, as prompted, why did you swap Scotland for Miami? Aren't you worried of losing what made you you? Or of becoming just another writer in exile a la mode... don't you want to be in the thick of it now? ps. great reading at Hackney Empire in the 90s...       I&apos;m in Edinburgh for about 3 months in the year, which is probably 2 more than I&apos;m in usually in Miami as I&apos;m mainly based in Chicago. Left Scotland for Chicago, but via Dublin, Amsterdam, San Francisco and London, and have also left most of those places for Edinburgh. I think it&apos;s swings and roundabouts for a writer; what you lose from not being fully immersed, you gain from the perspective of distance and vice-versa.              Kim Chandler McDonald    20 May 2014 4:02am  Its said that writing a book is like having a child ... there is the gestation period, the time of growth, and then, finally - you just want the thing OUT! I suggest that once it's out - the relationship continues... so my question is: from the premise of a 'relationship' with your work: When do you love it most and least?       The best thing is having the freedom of the blank page and creating scenarios and characters and pulling it all together. The worst thing is the constant revisions to make it read okay.              RabBurnout    20 May 2014 6:40am  How do you view Scotland and Britain now that you don't live there - has it changed your perception? Are you happy with your books after you've finished them and they've been published, or do you always think you can write a better one?       You always think that where you come from is mundane. When you live abroad you come to see it as weird and exotic. You&apos;re never satisfied, you can always do better.              JonnyGibbings    20 May 2014 7:50am  The publishing world is so risk averse now, unless you are a celebrity chef or a footballer, you are more likely to not get a deal. Would you have self published today?Also who do I have to kill to get you a copy of my book (that is banned in three countries due to its bad taste humour)?       I probably would have, for the reasons you say. Nobody would publish Trainspotting today. Probably my publicist at Random House.              JackSleet    20 May 2014 10:31am  Hi Irvine! Thanks for taking part in this webchat.  Comedy is a key component of your novels. Do you set out to write a &quot;funny story&quot;? Or, does the comedy emerge from the characters?  That links to my second question. Do you do a detailed outline before you write your first draft?  Thanks again for your time and thoughts.       No worries mate. The comedy, like the drama, should always come from the characters. Sometimes I&apos;ll write out an outline, other times I&apos;ll just fire in, then do the outline once I&apos;ve got stuff down.

Oh yes - And you had any brandy lately? What are you thoughts of buprenorphine? A god-send?       I only got into him after I was compared to him; hadn&apos;t read him before.

He has developed narrative styles that explore working class patterns of speech: idiomatic; often internalised. Original! How much has Kelman influenced your writing and in what ways?       I was blown away when I read the Bus Conductor Hines. It was very empowering to realise you could write like that.              ityfyu    20 May 2014 11:26pm  1. Will you suck my cock for a deep fried mars bar? ( it's a bit cold and soggy, mind ) 2. As a concise insult, has &quot;tube&quot; ever been bettered, and if so, what is your alternative? 3. Do you think I should have played it cool, and asked question 2 before question 1? 4. If you called my bluff, and answered question 1; &quot;yes&quot;, would you be satisfied with a deep fried mars bar? ( I'd consider giving it a quick re-fry ) 5. Do you agree that 5 is the greatest number in the universe?        Throw in a can of Irn Bru and we have a deal. Jambo No, you&apos;re doing okay See 1.

A bit more forgiving as I get older, but also a bit less indulgent.              ityfyu    21 May 2014 9:01am  Ahem, sorry about the above Mr Welsh, a beer or two and I'm a right gobshite.Really enjoyed &quot;Glue&quot;, it seemed a bit more gentle than some of your work, though it's a few years since I read it. And thought Porno was very funny, any more from Begbie and co. in the pipeline?       Yes. I&apos;ll write more about those characters, but probably not all together, as they would be (sadly) having separate adventures.              Jamie Curran    21 May 2014 10:53am  Mr Welsh :D How do the Americanians take to your colourful language? Have you had to tone it down since moving to the land of the free?  How do you find the local brand of socialism in Miami?  Thanks for the amazing stories.Jamie       Thankfully nobody can understand a word I say.

Thanks for taking part in this webchat.How would you explain the dialect in Trainspotting and your novels? Is it a strategy to display a real social environment? Is it a question of humor as well? I am writing an essay about dialect in your novels and I would like to know your opinion.Thanks a lot.       I tried to write Trainspotting in standard English but it sounded ludicrous and pretentious when I read it back. It was mainly an attempt to get the spirit of the characters and place into the fiction. The humour comes from the characters and the positions they find themselves in.              romfordmobbsy    21 May 2014 12:08pm  How does it fucking feel man, really?       It feels absolutely fucking brilliant mate.              XBBLCJR    21 May 2014 4:24pm  I forget the characters name but Spud getting a Joe McBride off that famous singer in Skag Boys was a particular highlight of the book for me. Is the singer woman based on any real person and are you able to name them if so? The other thing that sticks in my mind is Rents' description of the sea being like a massive, wavey Cabbage top when he was tripping on a train journey. Hope I remember that right.       I can&apos;t really answer the first question as it would be ungentlemanly. Yes, I think you&apos;ve recalled that one right.              SomeRandomPerson    21 May 2014 7:57pm  I enjoy your books even though they do contain some of the biggest scumbags in literature such as Begbie and Bruce Robertson. Out of all the characters you have created are there some you despise and would you like to meet any of them in a dark alleyway? For someone who enjoys your work are there any other contemporary authors you would recommend? Looking forward to The Sex Lives of Siamese Twins, if the title is anything to go by I'm expecting a family friendly romp about people being nice to each other and the importance of community spirit.       I don&apos;t think you really consider whether you like or dislike them. It&apos;s more about trying to understand their psychology. I think you need a certain level of both engagement and detachment from them to make them work on the page. Alan Warner, John King, Niall Griffiths. You won&apos;t be disappointed.              nes2203    22 May 2014 12:41am  Weird, only this week I said, 'I'd really like to ask Irvine Welsh ...' and then I see this opportunity.  I'm reading &quot;Skagboys&quot; at the moment (and love it as much as the other two) and I still finding Begbie about the most terrifying character I've ever come across in literature; probably because he is too much like someone I know. So the question I wanted to ask is, 'Was Begbie actually inspired by one particular person or just a &quot;type&quot;?' Not original but I was curious. Ta       I think there are about three people who I can recognise certain aspects of that character in. But I don&apos;t really base any character on one person, more of a type, or a mindset.              Grace Less    22 May 2014 3:56am  Welshie! Australia &amp;amp; specifically Sydney pop up every so slightly in many of your books. Even just a single reference or two. Out of all the cities in the world, how does Sydney end up making the cut?       Sydney is quite a magical place; it can also evoke other places I&apos;ve been, like London, San Fran, LA and even Edinburgh.

Had a pint with a couple of them last night. One of my best mates moved here twenty five years ago.              turbo52    22 May 2014 4:25am  One thing that I particularly enjoyed in Porno was the way you wrote in the first person for about five different characters, including one woman. What really intrigued me and set me on edge was the chilling way you seem to get inside a psycopathic mind such as Begbie. It feels so chilling and realistic. Now, I'm assuming you're not like Francois, so how do you manage to get inside his mind to create that incredibly realistic effect?       Thanks. I think you try to find something that evokes the character to you; it could be something they say, or a set of actions or attitudes expressed. These help you find your inner Begbie. I think we probably all have one.

It was built shortly after the second world war as part of a major urban expansion plan, following the garden city principles outlined by Ebenezer Howard. Today, the neighbourhood is characterised by a repetitive pattern of monotonous, four-storey tenement blocks. Ninety-five per cent of the mostly small houses are in the social-rent sector, and they are occupied by some 7,000 people, many of them from large immigrant families. Built between 1949 and 1953, the neighbourhood wasn\u2019t originally given a name, just a number, so residents began calling it by the same nickname as the church around which it was built: Kolenkit, or \u201ccoal-scuttle\u201d. Fifty years on, the area had fallen into despair and in 2004 was proclaimed the least popular neighbourhood in Amsterdam, with all \u201cliveability\u201d indicators in the red: high unemployment, poverty, youth crime and a relatively high rate of high-school drop-outs. By then an urban renewal programme had started, demolishing more than 1,000 houses and building back bigger homes to diversify the housing stock and attract more wealthy residents. Yet in 2007, when neighbourhood liveability and social security were made priorities on the national political agenda, Kolenkitbuurt was still listed as one of the worst neighbourhoods in the Netherlands. All 40 areas on that list were targeted with an intensified programme to prevent ghettoisation. The need for a different approach to solving the problems of disadvantaged neighbourhoods has been widely supported in theory and practice. Academics argue that \u201cbottom-up\u201d urbanism can respond more quickly to societal needs, compared to a top-down approach. Kolenkitbuurt is an example of this strategy \u2013 for the social part of the programme, the district government adopted an unusual approach.  A tender call was put out to garner ideas on improving liveability in the neighbourhood. The eventual winner would be awarded the opportunity (and an operational budget) to execute their plan for a limited amount of time, during which they could prove their value to the neighbourhood. The tender was won by Cascoland, a small international network of artists, architects and designers formed by Dutch community artists Fiona Bell and Roel Schoenmakers. Cascoland has guided participatory projects in South African slums and in Rio de Janeiro, among other cities; each time it has provided an empty casco (\u201cframe\u201d) of facilitation and artistic skills which is eventually given meaning by local communities.     Four mobile henhouses \u2013 with added decoration. Photograph: Mark Weemen    Cascoland had already been working in the Kolenkit area for three years as part of a study by the University of Amsterdam into the role of cultural enterprises in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. The fact they were already known by major stakeholders in the area \u2013 indeed were residents themselves \u2013 created the preconditions for a higher degree of local involvement, which was an advantage over other competitors. According to Stephen Graham, professor of cities and society at Newcastle University, one of the benefits of bottom-up urbanism is that it highlights creativity \u2013 in addition to encouraging entrepreneurship, providing incentives to property owners to maintain properties, and supporting environmentally sustainable development. In this sense, Bell and Schoenmakers have acted as cultural process managers for bottom-up initiatives and ideas. Due to the open character of their approach, however, no promises could be made about the outcome \u2013 which meant policymakers were initially reluctant to accept Cascoland unconditionally. The collective was allowed to run a pilot project for eight months from August 2010, with an operational budget that enabled two or three artists to work in the neighbourhood. The local housing corporation also made two small locations available for free; to gain a better understanding of the local residents and what services or activities were lacking, Cascoland began by organising weekly activities in these locations. The first was an open neighbourhood dinner where ideas were exchanged over an affordable meal. By hosting activities with a low barrier to entry, Schoenmakers and Bell gathered many participants to share information about what small additions would impact the quality of life in the neighbourhood most efficiently. This research phase revealed that the issue of liveability in itself was not perceived as problematic. Instead, the local families, many originating from rural areas of Morocco and Turkey, expressed a desire to keep small cattle as they had done in their home countries.         Video: the Cascoland Kolenkit project    According to Nina Wallerstein, professor of family and community medicine at the University of New Mexico, \u201cempowerment is a social-action process that promotes participation of people, organisations and communities towards the goals of increased individual and community control, political efficacy, improved quality of community life and social justice\u201d. Cascoland\u2019s involvement in Kolenkit increased its residents\u2019 feeling of responsibility about the interventions and services developed in the neighbourhood. Moreover, the empowerment process increased the residents\u2019 happiness with their living environments, because they could replicate some habits and activities typical of life in their home countries. For example, residents said they wanted more meeting places such as parks in the area. As a result, one of Cascoland\u2019s first interventions focused on a one-acre plot that had been vacant for years: the plot was derelict and surrounded by a fence, and perceived as a source of discomfort. Still, this piece of land was valuable because of its central location and its proximity to shops and the main walking routes in the neighbourhood, so Cascoland began by organising playful activities connected to the boundaries of the site \u2013 creating a labyrinth made from the fences so people could interact with the fenced environment in a positive way. As some residents had expressed a desire to keep chickens, Cascoland also developed four mobile henhouses for the site, which were designed and made in collaboration with the residents. Several neighbourhood families with children were selected to keep the chickens, under the condition that they would feed them and clean the henhouse.  Gradually, the vacant plot developed into a meeting place. The henhouses stimulated commitment from neighbours and encouraged them to take responsibility for the management of their public space. The government saw the success of this intervention and eventually removed the remaining fences, allowing the community to fully reappropriate the unused plot.  Indeed, the mobile henhouses proved such a success that Cascoland could not meet the demand of neighbours interested in keeping chickens. Schoenmakers and Bell saw this as an opportunity to implement another important aspect of their approach: empowerment. They helped these interested neighbours apply for a permit at the district office to enlarge the henhouse project, and ultimately enabled the community to co-operatively design and build a large chicken coop surrounded by fruit trees.

Photograph: Paul Fennis    Meanwhile, Kolenkitbuurt residents who frequented barbecue spots outside the city expressed a wish to have the same facility within their neighbourhood. At the time, other districts of Amsterdam were imposing stricter regulations to prevent the development of barbecues in parks and squares, but thanks to the moderation of Cascoland and the involvement of the local community, Kolenkit was able to implement this project. The HoutsKolenkit, a publicly accessible area furnished with three barbecue grills and several picnic tables, created a viable place for residents to cook dinner and eat together; it was a valuable social asset to the neighbourhood. Cascoland\u2019s strategy went further than simply facilitating general requests from residents, however. It was also able to identify less visible problems around the neighbourhood \u2013 for instance, children at the local school who were often appearing tired in class.  Upon investigation, this was traced to families letting visiting relatives sleep in children\u2019s bedrooms due to lack of space. The kids, forced to sleep on the couch, were tired the following day. Cascoland and the residents came up with a simple solution: one of the vacant apartments was turned into a neighbourhood guestroom, maintained and managed by neighbours, that can be booked for a small amount. In all, more than 20 interventions have been implemented since the beginning of the Cascoland project in 2010. Others include the decoration of a formerly dark and dank tunnel by neighbours, the creation of an ice-skating rink and a festive neighbourhood breakfast. Each project has its own purpose, its own planning, management and financing process, and different combinations of artists and residents are involved in each one.  In the beginning, policymakers had been reluctant to agree to such an open-ended approach to the Kolenkitbuurt programme. However, the openness of Cascoland\u2019s strategy \u2013 which did not include a precise set of outcomes, only a working method \u2013 can be considered its strength. No single \u201cresult\u201d should be regarded as the final stage of an urban revival process, and when institutions support the creation of a bottom-up initiative, they should also define how to transmit the management of the process to the citizens themselves. Cascoland was always focused on empowering the community to keep the programme going in the long term, helping residents to initiate and manage their own projects without outside assistance. In theory, this makes the Kolenkit programme resilient and Cascoland, in itself, redundant \u2013 so they can move on and focus on new initiatives.

He never changes. &quot;I&apos;m a worker. I vote socialist. Always,&quot; said the retired plumber, 81. But he thinks the governing Social Democrats of Austria&apos;s chancellor, Werner Faymann, will suffer badly when Europe goes to the ballot box this week. &quot;You&apos;ve got all these scandals with the banks, all the sleaze and corruption. The big parties will get weaker, not stronger.&quot; H\u00f6ppinger has lived all his life in the centre of &quot;Red Vienna&quot;, a city for ever run by Social Democrats. His home is in Karl Marx-Hof, the expressionist workers&apos; fortress that was Europe&apos;s pioneering experiment in social housing in the 1920s and then a battleground in the civil war of 1934, when the left lost to the pre-Hitler Austro-fascists. The complex still houses 5,000 people in 1,400 flats. But it is no longer a vibrant, cohesive community guaranteed to vote for the left. Rather, it is a multi-ethnic mixture of immigrants and poor Viennese, many of them unemployed, making it a fertile hunting ground for the far-right Freedom party of Heinz-Christian Strache: anti-EU, anti-immigration, anti-Muslim. &quot;You have areas here that are 70% immigrant and 30% Austrian,&quot; said Rudolf, 61, declining to give his surname. &quot;I&apos;ve got nothing against immigrants, but it&apos;s a big problem in Vienna. Strache might not be electable, but he is very strong here. The old parties just don&apos;t seem to have the answers any more. They&apos;ve been there for a very long time but now they are getting more competition. The Social Democrats will lose. Everything is in flux.&quot; Not only in Vienna. As the EU braces itself for four days of polling to send 751 MEPs to Strasbourg and Brussels from 28 countries, the temper of the union is one of sullen anger and frustration with a mainstream political class seen as detached and remote, incompetent and venal, and often illegitimate.           The results are certain to bring a bonanza for tub-thumping mavericks and radicals on the extreme right and the far left, with the traditional parties of the centre right and centre left haemorrhaging support to the fringes. &quot;We see the risks from these fringe groups being represented in the parliament,&quot; said Anthony Gardner, the US ambassador to the EU. Simon Hix, European politics professor at the London School of Economics, said: &quot;What&apos;s happening all across Europe is a decline of mainstream political parties, a fragmentation of the vote on the centre left and the centre right. The social democrats have lost the connection to lower-income voters by not producing jobs and squeezing public spending. There&apos;s a failure to generate jobs outside the big urban centres. The decline of manufacturing is replaced by service jobs in capital cities, doing nothing for the white underclass in Salford or Marseille. And the centre right [have] lost the rural conservatives because of their different metropolitan values and the perception they&apos;ve been captured by big business.&quot; The period between this week&apos;s vote and the last European election, in 2009, has been the EU&apos;s worst ever. The union&apos;s crowning achievement, the single currency, almost disappeared under the pressure of a banking and sovereign debt crisis that threatened to tear the EU apart. Five countries \u2013 Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Portugal and Ireland \u2013 were brought to their knees. Big questions, still unanswered, were raised about France and Italy \u2013 the eurozone&apos;s second and third economies. German-prescribed austerity and spending cuts were administered on a grand scale. Hundreds of billions were poured into a rotten banking sector whose reckless lending policies did much to create the crisis in the first place. The tensions and resentments brought a resurgence of nationalism in Europe. Youth unemployment soared to more than 25%, to more than 50% in Spain and Greece.      If the currency has been saved, the political price has been very high. On the eve of the elections, the EU is staring at years of stagnation and relative decline, increasingly unable to compete globally, to sustain its social and welfare systems, to generate growth and jobs. &quot;Europe is in a mess. Our economies are failing to deliver higher living standards for most people, and many have lost faith in politicians&apos; ability to deliver a brighter future, with support for extremists soaring,&quot; wrote Philippe Legrain, a former adviser to the head of the European commission and the author of a recent book on the crisis, last week. &quot;After the longest and deepest recession since the 1930s, the recovery is the flimsiest on record. Much of Europe remains lumbered with broken banks and crushing debts. Most of Europe suffers from record low investment and feeble productivity growth. All of Europe is ageing fast. Depressingly, most Europeans think younger generations will have a worse life than they do.&quot; And when things seemed irredeemably bleak, along came Russia&apos;s Vladimir Putin, invading and destabilising Ukraine, unilaterally redrawing the map of Europe on the EU&apos;s frontier, and challenging its leaders to stop him. &quot;If you listen to Putin, there&apos;s only contempt for Europe,&quot; said Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister. &quot;Europe has been living in a postmodern illusion, that everyone wants the same as we do, but just wants to get there at different speeds. That&apos;s just not true any more.&quot; One of the EU&apos;s top diplomats sounds desperate: &quot;We don&apos;t have a coherent strategic view and Putin is taking advantage of our shortcomings. What kind of European order do we want? If we cannot give straightforward answers as to what we want to do, you give everything to the populists.&quot; In London, Vienna, Berlin, Paris, Brussels and The Hague, the term &quot;populist&quot; is the hold-your-nose form of abuse for the anti-European mavericks and radicals riding high in the polls, beneficiaries of the collapse of public confidence in Europe&apos;s political elites \u2013 figures such as Nigel Farage in Britain, Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Strache in Austria, all of whom are tipped either to win or come a close second in the elections in their respective countries. &quot;We talk about them but never with them,&quot; said Ivan Krastev, a liberal Bulgarian political scientist. &quot;That will be different after these elections. You have a sclerotic political system and a resentment of elites. You have a democracy of mistrust.&quot; Besides, European populism is far from a fringe phenomenon. The mainstream centre right, the dominant force in European politics for the past decade, has included Hungary&apos;s Viktor Orban, Italy&apos;s Silvio Berlusconi and France&apos;s Nicolas Sarkozy in recent years, all of them proud populists. Hix argues that Europe&apos;s leaders are making a big mistake by ignoring the anti-European insurgents. They are not going away. The new parliament is likely to return three blocs of MEPs, around 150 in total, to the right of the mainstream conservatives. They veer from the Eurosceptical British and Polish conservatives to the outright Europe rejectionists of France&apos;s National Front, the Dutch Freedom party and Farage&apos;s Ukip.     Karl Marx Hof, the expressionist workers' fortress that was Europe's pioneering experiment in social housing in the 1920s. Photograph: Dave Penman/Rex Features    Then there is the often anti-EU hard left, which is likely to do well and supplant the Greens as the fourth biggest bloc in the new parliament. It will do creditably in Germany \u2013 where Die Linke is now the main opposition party to Angela Merkel&apos;s coalition of Christian and Social Democrats \u2013 in France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Czech Republic, and most of all in Greece, where Europe&apos;s leftist firebrand, Alexis Tsipras, is tipped to win the election. &quot;It&apos;s good for the European parliament that these populists get elected. They represent the real views of Europeans,&quot; said Hix. &quot;There is greater competition for low-skilled jobs. It&apos;s healthy and legitimate and the mainstream parties are forced to respond. But it&apos;s very difficult for the mainstream parties to get it.&quot; The conclusion frequently drawn from the rise of the Europhobes is that the EU is in the grip of an anti-Brussels insurgency as the primacy of the nation states of Europe is reaffirmed. But that conclusion is belied by the opinion polls, which show that public confidence has eroded severely in traditional political elites wherever they are found in Europe. A Eurobarometer survey unveiled on Monday found that trust in the EU had fallen steeply to 31% from 57% in 2007. But the same poll found that trust in national parliaments and governments was much lower, at 25% and 23%, and has been consistently lower than faith in the EU for all of the past decade.      This may be because, Britain apart, most countries have historically sought salvation in the EU from their own failed political elites and systems. For the Germans the EU brought rehabilitation from the Nazi shame. For the French, Italians and others the EU brought recovery from the trauma of Nazi occupation and collaboration. For Spain, Portugal and Greece the EU secured democracy and helped banish military dictatorships. For the east Europeans, the EU provided an escape channel from the clutches of communism and Soviet control. The hope of securing respite in the EU from corrupt and discredited national elites still obtains in the Balkans and in Ukraine. Britain here is the exception since fighting Hitler was its finest hour and because it has traditionally viewed Europe as a source of trouble rather than trust. But those times may be over. &quot;For many member states, the EU was a scaffolding. But now it&apos;s become a cage,&quot; said Brigid Laffan, director of the global governance programme at the European University Institute in Florence. Sikorski said: &quot;The EU had it easy for many years because we in central Europe were obsessed with rejoining Europe. We&apos;ve reached the limits of that.&quot; EU leaders continue to invoke history to bolster the argument for &quot;more Europe&quot;. But in the age of austerity, of slashed budgets, of wrenching reforms, of mass unemployment, recession and stagnation, the arguments have less and less traction if the EU&apos;s leaders are not delivering. &quot;The problem is not the Eurosceptics,&quot; said Joschka Fischer, the former German foreign minister. &quot;The problem is the mainstream parties. Completely irresponsible. What makes the Eurosceptics so strong? They&apos;re strong because they are managing the emotions and we are not. It&apos;s hard to counter their arguments.&quot; The mainstream counter-arguments are essentially inaudible. Take immigration, a sensitive and emotive topic dominating an agenda set by Farage, Le Pen and Wilders. On the centre left and the centre right, an immigration debate is being avoided, leaving the stage to those who shout loudest. Last October, when more than 300 refugees from north Africa drowned off the coast of Lampedusa in Italy, there was an outcry as an EU summit approached. Europe&apos;s national leaders opted to shelve the issue. Herman Van Rompuy, the European council president chairing the summit, scratched the topic from the agenda and arranged to have immigration up for debate at a summit at the end of next month. Why? Because, senior officials in Brussels said, EU leaders did not want to trigger arguments about immigration before the elections for fear of boosting the anti-immigrant campaigners. For the centre right in Britain, Germany and elsewhere, the response to the immigration controversy has been to try to appease the far right&apos;s supporters by talking about curbs on freedom of movement, clampdowns on alleged benefits tourism, tighter border controls. The centre right or Christian democrats have been the ascendant force in Europe in recent years and are predicted to win the elections very narrowly, but at the price of forfeiting around 60 seats, which would also make them the biggest losers. The mainstream centre left or social democrats have been gaining over the past three years. They now run France, Italy and Denmark and are in coalition in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, and are tipped to win in Sweden in September. But in March, France&apos;s ruling Socialists collapsed in local elections while the Dutch Labour party fell to 10%, losing control of its traditional power bases in the seaboard cities of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, The Hague and Groningen.     Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of Austra's far-right Freedom party, which is anti-EU, anti-immigration, anti-Muslim. Photograph: Georg Hochmuth/EPA    The fragmentation that is part of the current European political fabric was graphically displayed and could not be ascribed to the Wilders insurgency. Some 30% cast their ballots for new local and regional campaigners, highlighting the failure of the mainstream to maintain its appeal. The centre left has opted to keep generally quiet on immigration even though it may be the key to its central dilemma \u2013 how to secure welfare systems for its traditional constituencies in a time of low-growth austerity and neo-liberalism. &quot;The traditional parties have no real answers on immigration,&quot; said Ania Skrzypek, a Polish political scientist who helped draft the European social democrats&apos; election programme. &quot;For us, the main issue is about preserving the European social model. People feel the welfare state is not delivering. In western Europe many think the welfare systems are not sustainable. We just can&apos;t afford them. Migration is the answer. We have some answers, but we don&apos;t proclaim them.&quot; There is very little evidence in the academic analysis suggesting that migration within the EU has done anything other than bolster the welfare and pension systems of the host countries, with migrants generally contributing more in taxes than they take out in benefits. Rainer Muenz, a leading European demographer, argues that immigration is essential in a greying Europe, but that Europe&apos;s leaders have been asleep at the wheel. The next generation will be 25% smaller than the current one, with huge holes opening up in an EU labour market of 240 million, just under half the population of 505 million. His research concludes that extending retirement ages by a decade will fail to plug the gap and that it is already too late to bring in the numbers of migrants needed in ways that would be politically acceptable. &quot;The options on the table are not attractive for politicians \u2013 more migrants, later retirement and unemployment. Plus, a majority of voters will be over 50,&quot; he said. Laffan said: &quot;Europe has a huge demographic challenge. It&apos;s hard to cope with it politically, but if you analyse it you have to concede that we need inward immigration. But too much is done behind a veil. There&apos;s a lot of masking of a big part of the system. That degrades European politics.&quot; The &quot;masking&quot; extends above all to the handling of the euro emergency and the triumph of technocracy over democracy in four years of crisis management. A senior Spanish politician points out how difficult it was to campaign for office and be taken seriously when budget, spending and fiscal policies were being decided elsewhere by a troika of anonymous men in suits from the European commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. &quot;The voters are not stupid. They know you cannot deliver on what you&apos;re telling them. They don&apos;t believe you. You lose legitimacy,&quot; he said. Laffan said: &quot;It&apos;s the politics of constrained choice. You need to tell the public that. But the leaders have been in denial. There&apos;s a lot of dissembling, politics by stealth. It drains politics of credibility.&quot; That&apos;s a view commonly held among policy-makers and senior officials in Brussels. &quot;Our government is not credible any more,&quot; said an ambassador in Brussels of one member state. &quot;You have to tell people things they don&apos;t like. If you don&apos;t, you get a populist party. You need to let people benefit from the new Europe and it&apos;s not happening.&quot; Another ambassador from a large member state said of the elections: &quot;It will be a pretty large populist revolt against elites. There&apos;s a very real risk that the barbarians are at the gates and that the gates will be closed. The risk is of complacency.&quot; In Karl Marx-Hof, H\u00f6ppinger noted that he was born in Vienna the year that the Austro-fascists were shelling the housing complex he has lived in for decades. Their heirs, he said, were back. &quot;Strache does a lot of shouting, but he doesn&apos;t have any answers. But people are voting for him.&quot;", "sentences": ["But in March, France&apos;s ruling Socialists collapsed in local elections while the Dutch Labour party fell to 10%, losing control of its traditional power bases in the seaboard cities of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, The Hague and Groningen."], "title": "European elections: union left sullen by fury and frustration with political class", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/19/european-elections-fury-frustration-extreme-right-far-left-union", "tags": ["European elections", "European Union", "Politics", "The far right", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-20T08:58:54Z", "article": "Spurred on by the publication of We Own The City, an impressively thorough study of the impact of neighbourhood initiatives across five cities \u2013 Hong Kong, New York, Taipei, Moscow and Amsterdam \u2013 we now really want to hear about other community projects that are making a significant difference to your city.

As the United States recovered from war, community gardens diminished in number, but they made a comeback in the early 1970s when food prices increased and an environmental consciousness arose. The Garden and Greening Programme was established by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) in 1963 to beautify residences, educate the population and support residents interested in gardening. At the beginning, the authority distributed flyers inviting tenants to garden and a contest was organised. The initiative was warmly welcomed and 105 gardens were planted in over 65 NYCHA developments. Urban agriculture initiatives \u2013 in particular, community gardens \u2013 are strongly supported by the association to this day, despite its difficult economic situation. The benefits that gardening activities provide for these communities are seen to be worth the extra effort and resources required to implement them.  Many academics have focused on the motives that drive people to participate in a community garden. The most common are health benefits, access to food, neighbourhood beautification and social interactions. These are the main reasons behind the creation of NYCHA gardens \u2013 and they are the motivations that drive gardeners in the Garden of Eden.  Garden of Eden is a community garden on the grounds of one of NYCHA\u2019s housing developments in Fort Greene, a neighbourhood in the northwestern part of Brooklyn. Today, Fort Greene is an effervescent neighbourhood that attracts artists inspired by the many cultural facilities the area offers. It has a rich and well-preserved history, and a large African-American community whose roots go back to the beginning of the 19th century. At that time the Brooklyn Navy Yard, once the largest naval construction facility in the United States, opened its doors and provided opportunities for skilled workers. By the 1870s, more than half of the African-American population of Brooklyn lived in this neighbourhood, alongside Irish, German and English immigrants. During the second world war, the Brooklyn Navy Yard increased its workforce, and in 1944 NYCHA built two public housing developments for the wartime workforce: the Raymond V Ingersoll houses and the Walt Whitman houses. These high-rise developments occupied 38 acres, 20% of the neighbourhood, and accommodated 14,000 people in 3,500 units. In 1966, however, the shutdown of the Navy Yard left many residents unemployed.     The New York City Housing Authority owns the land where the Garden of Eden is based, giving the project security and continuity. Photograph: Peggy Truong    In 2004, the Fort Greene area was \u201cre-zoned\u201d to retain jobs that were at risk of leaving the city. Since then, it has been undergoing a quick transformation \u2013 including the development of new, luxury, highrise residential buildings. Another consequence of the re-zoning was the loss of local affordable commercial retail space, as local small business owners and low- and moderate-income consumers have been excluded while national chain retailers have been encouraged to move in. In this context, the contribution of local non-profit organisations is very important to address local needs. The Myrtle Avenue Revitalization Project (Marp) is a non-profit established in 1999 that aims to restore the economic vitality of Myrtle Avenue, one of the main streets of Fort Greene. The Ingersoll and Walt Whitman houses stretch along Myrtle Avenue for nearly a kilometre, so Marp has offered a lot of support to these residents since its beginnings. In 2009, the lack of affordable and fresh food in the area arose as a crucial issue. The residents came up with the idea of gardening to tackle this shortage. A group of six African-American women, supported by Meredith Phillips Almeida, deputy director at Marp, approached NYCHA with the idea of creating a community garden at the Ingersoll houses. The proposal for the Garden of Eden was approved, and NYCHA leases the space to the gardeners, who must renew the contract every year.  The garden has been very successful, expanding every year to satisfy the high demand for gardening space from the NYCHA residents. The gardeners grow both flowers and vegetables, beautifying their neighbourhood while also enjoying fresh produce. The garden started with eight planting boxes and now has 40, plus a long waiting list that continues to grow. This spring, NYCHA and the residents have started a new garden at the Ingersoll houses to satisfy demand.  According to Ferris, Norman and Sempik (2001), \u201cWhat distinguishes a community garden from a private garden is the fact that it is in some sense a public garden in terms of ownership, access and degree of democratic control.\u201d It involves the convergence of multiple individuals joining together in diverse settings to grow food, among other things. Garden of Eden is a good example of how a community initiative can thrive on multiple partnerships. Besides NYCHA and Marp support, Garden of Eden has benefited from several grants provided by Citizens Committee for New York City (CCNYC), one of the oldest micro-funding organisations in New York City. CCNYC conducts workshops and awards micro-grants to resident-led groups to support their neighbourhood improvement initiatives. In 2012, Garden of Eden received a grant that helped with the expansion of the garden as well as the purchase of a compost barrel. In 2013, the gardeners applied again, helped by Marp, and with that grant installed an irrigation system.  To better understand the success of Garden of Eden in its first four years, social, economic and institutional indicators should all be taken into account. The social dimension plays a crucial role in the garden\u2019s success: one of the indicators that measures this social aspect is diversity. The many stakeholders involved have strengthened the community garden by contributing to the decision-making process. The gardeners embody the diversity of the community, encompassing people of African American, Bangladeshi and Chinese descent and all different age groups. The rich variety of vegetable crops and flowers grown by the members reflects, in some cases, their cultural preferences.         Garden of Eden project, Brooklyn, New York    Another social indicator of its success is the active participation of the gardeners. Over the four years, trusting relationships have been developed, creating a strong network between the gardeners and the institutions involved. NYCHA\u2019s close support of the gardeners has contributed to increase \u201csocial capital\u201d, defined by trust, cooperation, reciprocity and networks. Many academics have analysed how community greening creates human, natural, physical and financial capital \u2013 which together lead to social capital. The economic dimension is also crucial to the success and longevity of the initiative. Diversity is key here: the several sources of economic support greatly improve the chances that Garden of Eden will successfully continue in the future. Each of the institutions involved supports the initiative in different ways: while CCNYC provides the gardeners with grants, NYCHA and Marp contributions are focused mainly on providing services for the gardeners, such as an annual award or skill-building workshops.  Another important economic indicator is the security of land tenure, which is one of the biggest challenges that urban agriculture initiatives face. The fact that NYCHA owns the land gives sufficient stability to the garden and ensures its continuation and even its expansion, planned for next year. Finally, the institutional dimension can be measured by looking at the capacity for self-organisation and leadership among the gardeners. Learning by themselves how to grow food, establish participatory rules, organise activities and advocate with city government \u2013 as well as having a clear leader \u2013 strengthens the community, and thus contributes to the resilience of the Garden of Eden.

It usually starts with a very practical problem \u2013 you want to hang a painting, but you don&apos;t own a power drill, for example. But once people experience what it is to meet a neighbour and connect, they realise it&apos;s not just solving a practical problem, but a lot of fun. 3. Who do you hope will use it?Everyone who lives in a city. As a species we are wired to deal with a few hundred people. Being surrounded by millions can be overwhelming. Peerby creates one-to-one connections: the kind of connection we know how to deal with. 4. What&apos;s your competition?Our biggest competition is from shops that offer cheap products, often built for obsolescence. We want to make borrowing so convenient and fun that it&apos;s an obvious choice for products you only need once in a while. 5. How will your app change the world?Peerby members feel more connected to the people around them and their neighbourhood. You get to see the proof that most people around you are warm and friendly and willing to help. And it has an impact on sustainability: we cannot continue consuming the way we do. Peerby helps people to have access to everything they need, while wasting significantly fewer resources.  Tanguy Goretti of Djump     The team at Djump, based in Paris and Brussels    Djump (Paris/Brussels) is a peer-to-peer car sharing service that allows drivers with a car to register, users to request a ride, and drivers to answer the call. Users can track drivers in real time and can choose to give a voluntary donation. 1. What event or problem inspired you to think of the app? We were all inhabitants of Brussels, top in the list of worst European congested cities. We just couldn\u2019t let that happen! Some people travel in the same direction every day without knowing they could ride together. First we launched a kind of carpooling Doodle, then we focused on the B2B market with Djengo, a carpooling platform for home-work trips.  2. Is it for business or pleasure? Djump is both for business and pleasure. We definitely like living with the feeling we can have a tiny footprint on the book of innovative and cool projects that make the world evolve towards a more sustainable, affordable and safe place.  3. Who do you hope will use it? Djump is currently mainly used by young people aged 20-30 to party downtown. But the objective is to provide a reliable, flexible and affordable transportation solution for everyone.  4. What&apos;s your competition?When we launched Djump one year ago, we were the first peer-to-peer on-demand ridesharing system in Europe. Then Uber launched its UberPOP service and Wundercar landed in Berlin. But our main competitor remains car ownership, unquestionably. 5. How will your app change the world?Our app won\u2019t change the world, but our community will. Djumpers and drivers together will make a better and more optimised use of existing resources. We also think that the car can bring people closer not only because of its transportation function but because it is a place to share views and create new friendships.   Patrick T Hoffman of Social Cyclist     The team at Social Cyclist, based in New York    Social Cyclist (New York) encourages bike riders to map their preferred routes, report hazardous road conditions and vote on their preferred site locations for future cycling infrastructure. The app can also give feedback on and report problems with bikesharing schemes. This aggregate data can then be used by cities to plan future infrastructure. 1. What event or problem inspired you to think of the app? Our work with Social Bicycles prompted us to think of how we could bring some of the existing benefits \u2013 ready access to personal route data, social sharing of rides, categorising rides by purpose \u2013 of the SoBi system to other communities. We also felt that bike riders and bike-share programs were missing out on many benefits of new technology. For instance, most community engagement for system planning and expansion centered on PC-based websites, rather than both web and mobile. 2. Is it for business or pleasure?While we created Social Cyclist to fulfill a specific business need, the app is primarily designed for pleasure. It&apos;s meant to help bike riders in different communities co-create their bike system with local political leaders. We help bike riders easily log and share their rides, connect with friends or other nearby riders for group rides, report and view problems in real-time, and much more. As important as these aspects, however, is how we make this aggregate data public.  3. Who do you hope will use it?While we hope every bike rider will use the app, we think the most compelling case will involve communities who organise a campaign around data collection and a conversation about existing or proposed infrastructure. We also see the app being widely used by riders of bike share around the world who are looking for a great, easy to use app, for both seeing the status of their stations and providing their local bike share operator and other members with actionable feedback.  4. What&apos;s your competition?For providing basic bike share data, our biggest competitor is Spotcycle, but we take a different perspective on what information bike-share riders need and when they need it. The aspects of our app that deal with engaging a community around a topic such as Suggested Bike Parking have competitors in apps like Shareabouts by OpenPlans, or WikiMapping. 5. How will your app change the world? Well, it&apos;s already changing the world of Social Bicycles, as we and our partners have made great use of it in new markets like Hamilton, Canada. We also recently rolled out a new feature set focused on the world&apos;s existing bike-share programmes. The app now includes data for over 7,000 bike share stations: we&apos;ve begun conversations with a few of those operators already. \u2022 Smart or stupid: will our cities of the future be easier to hack?", "sentences": ["Daan Weddepohl of Peerby     The team at Peerby, based in Amsterdam    Peerby (Amsterdam) is a &quot;marketplace liquidity hack&quot; that encourages neighbours to share items."], "title": "The best city app competition finals: who should win?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/may/21/best-city-app-competition-appmycity-final-three", "tags": ["City apps", "Cities", "Cycling", "Crowdsourcing"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-22T21:13:52Z", "article": "Paul Dummett has received death threats and menacing messages from Uruguay fans who blame the Newcastle United defender for the knee injury which has placed Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s World Cup hopes in jeopardy.

The group includes members of the prominent Shinawatra family, including former premier Yingluck Shinawatra, who was forced to step down two weeks ago. Those disobeying the army&apos;s summons were warned that they would be arrested and prosecuted, the army&apos;s new governing body, the National Peace and Order Maintenance Council (NPOMC), said. Yingluck arrived at the Royal Thai Army base on Friday morning in a bulletproof vehicle surrounded by bodyguards, local media reported, but left after 30 minutes for another army facility, according to the Associated Press. It was unclear what the army&apos;s summons entailed, as media were not allowed inside the base and reporting has been highly restricted, with many Thai and international TV channels off-air. Some were later released but by Friday evening, the whereabouts of those still in detention remained unclear. Thaksin&apos;s lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, issued a statement warning that the &quot;illegal seizure of power&quot; could result in a power divide. &quot;The military coup carried out by the army of Thailand does not have any legitimacy, nor does the army of Thailand have a mandate from the people of Thailand to govern the country,&quot; Amsterdam said. &quot;Those who have the mandate of the people of Thailand, secured through free and fair elections, are now considering the formation of a government in exile.&quot; The chief of the army,General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who staged Thursday&apos;s coup and is acting prime minister, also summoned a number of other high-ranking anti- and pro-government leaders for talks, among them the recently deposed premier Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan, as well as former labour minister Chalerm Yubamrung. Foreign ambassadors were also invited to meet with the new NPOMC at 4pm local time. The detention of such a large number of politicians and leaders is significant, not least because it involves the Shinawatra clan \u2013 a highly polarising family in Thailand. The 64-year-old leader of the group, Thaksin \u2013 a telecoms tycoon and former prime minister who was deposed in a 2006 military coup \u2013 was hugely popular among rural voters and lauded for his populist policies while in office. But he was equally derided by Bangkok&apos;s urban, pro-royalist elites, who accused the politician of cronyism and corruption. Despite having been deposed eight years ago, Thaksin is still at the forefront of the political turmoil, during which 28 people have been killed and 700 injured since November \u2013 when protests against the Yingluck-led Pheu Thai party were sparked by a proposed amnesty bill that would have ushered in Thaksin&apos;s return to Thailand. The government has since been in a political deadlock, with anti-Thaksin forces fighting for the installation of a non-appointed leader who would oversee vague reforms, and pro-Thaksin forces calling for elections. Pro-Thaksin parties have won every election since 2001. Now the army is at the helm and has promised not only to restore order but also institute the reforms \u2013 although just how, and under what circumstances, has not yet been made clear. On Friday evening, hundreds of protesters held a candlelit vigil in downtown Bangkok with banners reading &quot;No coup!&quot;, &quot;Let people vote&quot; and &quot;Military junta \u2013 get out!&quot;. A large group of soldiers initially attempted to disperse the crowd, before allowing them to hold the sit-in at the central MBK shopping centre, local media reported. Earlier, unverified reports circulated that the military was attempting to detain pro-Thaksin redshirts in the north and north-east of the country. According to online news portal Khaosod, the army has also closed off a Thai-Laos border crossing in an effort to prevent them from fleeing the country. Like Thaksin, army chief Prayuth is no stranger to coups: he was part of the junta that helped depose Thaksin in 2006, a takeover that helped cement a massive pro-Thaksin support base known as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship, and eventually led to massive street battles between royalist yellowshirts and pro-Thaksin supporters in 2010, resulting in the deaths of nearly 100 people. While Prayuth claimed that the takeover would help restore peace to the nation, &quot;it&apos;s the very act of a military takeover that is likely to\u00a0\u2026 provoke acts of violence and possibly cause more loss of life&quot;, said the Bangkok Post in an editorial on Friday. &quot;This coup is not the solution.&quot; Thursday&apos;s coup \u2013 the country&apos;s 19th since an absolute monarchy was abolished here in 1932 \u2013 has been condemned by a number of nations, including France, Japan, Australia, the EU, UN and US. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said there was no justification for the coup and called for the release of all detained politicians. Most analysts have said the situation in Thailand was unlikely to get any better any time soon. &quot;The &apos;hardliner&apos; generals now run the show and we should expect [a] bad outcome,&quot; said a report by the Siam Intelligence Unit thinktank. &quot;The new junta government will run the country for one to two years. The worst possible scenario is a chronic civil war.&quot; By 6pm, some television channels had returned to normal broadcasting after a full 24 hours of military programming. All television and radio stations in Thailand, including foreign channels such as the BBC and CNN, had been off-air, resulting, in some circumstances, in endlessly repeated scenes of Prayuth declaring the military coup, played over and over in bizarre loops. In a comedic act of defiance, Thais took to the Facebook page of the NPOMC to request new singles be played over the airwaves, complaining that the nationalist bandstand songs \u2013 which hail from the first and second world wars and the cold war, and sport titles such as The Motherland&apos;s Cancer \u2013 had begun to grate a little. They also requested their favourite television shows be aired again. &quot;Please put the soap operas back on!&quot; said one Facebook user. &quot;I&apos;m so bored. 7-Eleven has been closed because of the curfew. Nothing to eat.&quot; The junta issued an order banning all media from reporting information deemed a threat to national security, any criticism of the NPOMC, or news that could incite confusion, conflict or unrest, online newspaper Prachatai reported. A popular Bangkok bookstore, Kinokuniya, also told Reuters that it had been ordered to remove copies of nearly 10 books from its shelves, some related to Thailand&apos;s political divisions. A special committee has been established to help monitor online news, with all internet service providers required to monitor, and block, reports that could lead to unrest or &quot;contravene public morals&quot;. Some feared that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, which are hugely popular in the kingdom, would be shut down as a result.

So ingrained in our lives are our smart devices that faux medical conditions have been created, the pick of the bunch being ringxiety (the phenomenon of mistakenly checking your mobile phone in the belief that you are receiving a call) and phantom vibration syndrome. And not to be forgotten, the Daily Mail&apos;s warning that pedestrian-related mobile phone injuries have doubled in the last five years and are set to do the same again by 2015. Smart devices \u2013 by which I count smartphones, tablets and the perfectly balanced portmanteau phablets \u2013 in their mere seven-year existence have begun to replace countless things in our day-to-day lives. Satnavs, torches, alarm clocks, remote controls, pocket translation books, photo albums, cameras, USB sticks, compact mirrors, portable games consoles, golf scorecards, guitar tuners, baby monitors, digital radios \u2013 the list goes on. The Guardian itself even signalled the demise of Ordnance Survey in its paper maps form last month and the meteoric rise of Snapchat has as good as killed off kids writing love letters to each other. It seems that even the most trivial of items cannot escape impending doom by way of smartphone, with Ellie Goulding tweeting from her US tour earlier this year: &quot;Last nights [sic] show was a first \u2026 people throwing iPhones onstage. So naturally I took selfies on them and threw them back&quot;. Imagine going back in time and telling Sir Tom on his knicker-strewn stage in the Seventies that in less than 40 years gig-goers would be hurling \u00a3600 mini computers at his pop star equivalents instead. Not only have smartphones replaced things, but they&apos;ve created new behaviours with second screening and showrooming being most prevalent. They&apos;ve also forced us to renegotiate manners and etiquette as devices get pulled out and pored over in meetings, over dinner and in the bedroom. Banksy&apos;s Mobile Lovers captures this social dilemma brilliantly and New York band The Yeah Yeah Yeahs proactively ask fans to come and be &quot;in the moment&quot; instead of viewing their gigs through via a smartphone screen. Of course, the generation-defining selfie itself is a product of having a front-facing camera on our smartphones and has spurned embarrassing politicians, duck pouts and the occasional hit pop song. Arguably, the smartphone&apos;s impact on time is the biggest disruption of all. The ability to access any nugget of information within 30 seconds has empowered today&apos;s generation of smartphone owners like never before. This new sense of immediacy has shortcutted the way we complain, translate words, order takeaways, and navigate comfortably around places we&apos;ve never visited before. What&apos;s more, smart devices have filled in gaps that used to exist in our day before we carried smartphones around in our pockets and purses \u2013 essentially rendering dead time as dead. It is in this disruption of time that brands and advertisers should sense the biggest opportunity, be that an acknowledgement of mobile&apos;s ability to dismantle the traditional funnel that has served marketers since the dawn of advertising or create moments of time to give back to customers as a reward just like KitKat have done in Amsterdam, allowing consumers to enter a &quot;Free No Wi-Fi Zone&quot; and literally &quot;Take a Break&quot;. Google&apos;s Eric Schmidt captures mobile&apos;s trajectory brilliantly, stating that: &quot;The pace of change now is the slowest it will ever be.&quot; With that in mind, expect an abundance of mobile-driven disruption happening faster than we could ever imagine it.

Using aerial reconnaissance and tracking devices attached to resupply trucks, federal special agents were trying to locate the latest gang of armed drug traffickers responsible for more than 100,000 plants discovered growing in national forests since Colorado first began its limited commercial decriminalisation experiment five years ago. The full legalisation of retail marijuana suppliers and growers, which came into effect in January, might have been expected to mark the end of the matter as far as Colorado&apos;s law enforcement authorities were concerned. Forest police monitoring the sophisticated farms camped out in the vast Rocky mountain wilderness believe most of their production is destined for other US cities such as Chicago, where it is still illegal, rather than local shops. But the persistence of unregulated grow sites on federal land is just one of many legal tensions exacerbated by the decision of states like Colorado and Washington to jump so far ahead of US national drug policy. In another example, Colorado legislators this month had to pass a new state law to allow for a cannabis co-operative credit union that would let marijuana businesses open bank accounts and escape the murky world of cash-only transactions. Yet most national banks and credit card companies remain barred from dealing with the industry and only last month the federal Drug Enforcement Agency raided four marijuana stores in Denver, smashing doors and forcing open safes in the latest crackdown on businesses suspected of money laundering. The state&apos;s next legal amendment is likely to establish Opec-style production caps to deter its legitimate growers from diverting excess supply to illegal dealers in neighbouring states. But special agents working for the national forest service are already monitoring a second industrial-size grow site in the Colorado mountains that they believe is back up and running after the winter snow without any regard for the strict electronic tagging system required for each plant in regulated facilities. The contrast between these two worlds \u2013 one legal and flourishing, the other illegal and stubbornly disregarding of state lines \u2013 can seem baffling, yet it may have profound consequences for whether this unique experiment spreads. Moving into a &apos;post-prohibition world&apos; Down in Colorado&apos;s Front Range, the cluster of towns and cities that cling to the eastern edge of the Rockies, the scent of what has been dubbed a commercial \u201cgreen rush\u201d is hanging in the air \u2013 literally. On the road in from Denver airport, several of the state&apos;s estimated 800-900 legal growers have taken advantage of cheap warehouse space to open sophisticated indoor facilities, whose odour is clearly discernible by passing motorists.     A worker for the National Forest service team removing one of over 7,000 plants found at St Vrains Creek near Lyons, Colorado. Photograph: National forest service    Even before taking into account the construction boom, the local pot industry is thought to have created 15,000 new jobs over the last four years, with annual sales growing from $400m in 2013 to an estimated $600m this year, according to Vicente. The scale of the industry, with its heavy regulation and large cash turnover, has created lucrative work for ancillary advisers such as accountants and lawyers. Brian Vicente was co-director of the campaign to legalise recreational marijuana in Colorado, and now reaping the benefits of his advocacy. His law firm is one of the fastest-growing in the state, and with 20 attorneys to service several hundred clients in the industry. In Vicente Sederberg&apos;s wood-panneled offices in downtown Denver, its founding partner acknowledges there are plenty more legal and regulatory obstacles to iron out. \u201cIt&apos;s a process,\u201d says Vicente. &quot;Marijuana was illegal, by and large, for 80 years. Now we are moving into this post-prohibition world, we are really interested in establishing the most responsible policies possible.&quot; But making sure the industry stays on the right side of the rapidly changing law is vital to its plans for growth in five other states that campaigners hope may join Colorado and Washington in legalising recreational marijuana by the end of 2016. These include Alaska and Oregon, which are top priorities for campaigners, followed potentially by Massachusetts, Nevada, Arizona and California \u2013 a target list which recently prompted Vicente Sederberg to open an office in Boston.   This is going to be a very large national market in five to eight years and banks will absolutely want to work with this industry; it&apos;s going to be large and powerful,\u201d adds the law firm&apos;s founder.  Vicente has also met elected officials from the UK, Australia, Jamaica and Uruguay, which flew Colorado experts down to South America to advise on how to bring an end to its war on soft drugs. Visiting one of Denver&apos;s scores of new pot shops is indeed a bewildering experience, even for the sober. Livegreen Cannabis, in the suburb of Edgewater, is typical of many that converted from medical marijuana dispensaries \u2013 requiring a doctor&apos;s certificate \u2013 to a full retail outlet when the law changed in January. As a saleswoman explains the products and prices on offer, the complexity of the system becomes apparent. There are different supply limits for in-state and out-of-state customers; different tax rates for medicinal and recreational customers and a host of different strains, tinctures and medibles (\u201cedibles that are medicinal\u201d) that compete with a new concentrated form of marijuana called wax The wide eyes and raspy voices on both sides of the counter suggest locals have less difficulty working out where to start, but visitors looking to consume rather than gawp also have to grapple with a ban on smoking in public places, cars and hotels which has so far mostly prevented the opening of Amsterdam-style coffee shops. But a short drive away from the city, in the mountains that also host some of America&apos;s swankiest ski resorts, there is still a reminder of the industry&apos;s grubbier days growing weed in the woods.     The grow site at St Vrains Creek near Lyons, Colorado, where 3,559 and 3,995 plants were confiscated in two separate raids. Photograph: National forest service    With just 35 uniformed patrol officers and six plain clothes special agents to cover 22m acres over five states, the National Forest Service is struggling to cope with an outbreak that leaves a trail of environmental as well as law enforcement headaches. \u201cEveryone&apos;s speculation was, you legalise it and the problem will go away, but we have not seen a decrease,\u201d says Laura Mark, the special agent in charge of the Rocky Mountain region. \u201cAnd at this point I would say I do not anticipate an impact or reduction in these grows just because marijuana has been legalised.\u201d The White River national park, where a father and son last stumbled across 3,375 plants while hiking late last September, is not as peaceful as it looks.     White River National Park is home to some illegal growing sites.   Only this month, roads in the area were closed off after a state trooper was shot while pulling over a suspect vehicle. Ski towns in the area, including world famous resorts like Vail and Aspen, have tried to minimise marijuana suppliers to control any influx of stoned tourists. But even gnarled park service veterans are impressed at the logistical feats required to maintain plantations as large as 8,700 plants miles from the nearest road. \u201cThese operations are very organised,\u201d says Mark. If we could pull off to the same magnitude the logistical feats that these individuals do in building a city within the forest, it would be pretty amazing.\u201d     This was the campsite used by workers growing 1,600 plants at Indian Creek in the Pike National forest, near Denver, last October. Photograph: National forest service    Pits are dug to create water reservoirs which are then connected to irrigation systems that would put a golf course to shame. Terraced bunk beds are built in the trees to provide round-the-clock accommodation for crews of farmers and heavily-armed guards, many of whom have come from as far as the drug cartels of Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. Just finding the clearing can be hard enough. Trees felled to make way for the bushes have their stumps painted green to prevent them being spotted from the air. Most are found by accident by hikers or if the wind is in the right direction. \u201cOnce you get out there you are like a mountain goat, crawling up and down hills, hauling plants,\u201d says Mark, a veteran of many raids in Colorado and California. \u201cElevation, heat, bugs, snakes: it&apos;s arduous to say the least.\u201d &apos;I think the black market is already on its way out&apos; Less admired are the powerful, but often banned, pesticides and fertilisers left behind by growers which contribute to hundreds of thousands of dollars in clean-up costs for each site. The park service says that, since the legalisation of regulated marijuana growers in Colorado, it has experienced a drop in support from local law-enforcement agencies, according to the park service. \u201cIn a lot of cases they have made a determination that this is a federal issue not a state issue any more and they have stepped back,\u201d says assistant special agent Heiko Bornhoff. \u201c [They tell us] &apos;you guys do what you need to do but we are not going to support you in the way we used to&apos;,\u201d he adds. Despite an overall reduction in crime since Colorado&apos;s legalisation of marijuana, many law enforcement agents like Bornhoff remain sceptical of the state&apos;s ability to enforce regulation prohibiting illegally grown drugs entering the legal distribution chain. But for the industry&apos;s advocates, such attitudes are redolent of the failure of some in the law enforcement community to let go of a pursuit which used to keep many gainfully employed.     Brian Vicente was co-director of the campaign to legalise recreational marijuana in Colorado.   \u201cSince we legalised marijuana \u2013 something no one thought we were going to do \u2013 we have seen some complaints from law enforcement, which has always been the main obstacle to ending the war on drugs,\u201d says Vicente. \u201cPolice in Colorado used to arrest 10,000-plus people for marijuana possession every single year.

In Amsterdam, long famous for its coffee shops, identifiable by pictures of marijuana outside and fumes wafting through the door, international experts gathering to discuss cannabis regulation said the international conventions, once so heavily policed by the US, would now be increasingly flouted. Already many countries, most notably the Netherlands and Spain, have bypassed the rules. &quot;The key is always the US in drug policy,&quot; said Professor Robin Room of the charity Turning Point and Melbourne University in Australia. &quot;It would be acting differently if it did not have Colorado and Washington on its conscience. &quot;The dynamic in the United States looks unstoppable. Even if a Republican were elected to replace Obama, they would think twice before cracking down on it all. What would they gain from it? The Republicans realise they are in a box, appealing only to elderly white men. &quot;It is an ocean liner that is exceedingly difficult to turn around but there will probably be a state or two in 2014 and another couple in 2016 voting for legalisation. That poses a big conundrum to the world: the most important nation in drugs policy is in defiance of the treaty it was responsible for.&quot; The position of the US as the world&apos;s enforcer of drugs prohibition has been undermined not only by cannabis legalisation in Colorado and Washington states, but also Uruguay in South America. The Obama administration has elected to ignore any flouting of the UN drug conventions of 1961, 1971 and 1988, which require countries to prohibit the use, possession and supply of cannabis, although the US justice department has warned against allowing children to obtain the drug and profits going to criminal gangs. The treaty is rarely observed but countries evade it in different ways. In Amsterdam and many, but not all, places in the Netherlands, the sale and use of cannabis is tolerated but not legal. But supply is illegal and prosecuted, which has led to the serious problems that have caused some towns to shut their coffee shops. Drug gangs involved in all kinds of criminality, including trafficking, flourish by supplying the drug. The Netherlands is deeply distressed that toleration may be encouraging crime, to the point where its justice minister favours closing down the cannabis trade altogether. But the model has spread. There are coffee shops in Ljubljana, Zagreb and Berlin. Spain, on the other hand, has networks of &quot;cannabis social clubs&quot;, where people get together to grow what they need for personal use. In the UK, now one of the countries with the toughest stance on cannabis, social clubs on the Spanish model have been quietly taking off. There are now 60 of them, with some 60,000 people in some way involved, said Greg de Hoedt, who is head of the UK Cannabis Social Clubs, a body set up to advise them and advocate for change and which has been busy lobbying politicians. Nick Clegg is one of those onside, said De Hoedt, who was off to meet the coalition Home Office minister Norman Baker. Clubs secretly grow their own cannabis. &quot;It&apos;s about 100 times less than it costs on the street and it&apos;s a better quality product,&quot; said De Hoedt, who complains that the drug available on the street can contain fertilisers and sometimes heavy metals. &quot;Criminal gangs aren&apos;t taking account of that,&quot; he said.     A woman smokes cannabis at a '420 Day' demonstration in London's Hyde Park, calling for cannabis to be legalised.  Photograph: Andy Rain/Camera Press    The clubs also organise collective acts of civil disobedience. On 20 April \u2013 now a global celebration of cannabis known as &quot;420 day&quot; \u2013 about 10,000 people gathered in Hyde Park to smoke joints in defiance of the police. &quot;People lit up en masse at 4.20[pm],&quot; said De Hoedt. There were a few arrests and cautions, but that was all. De Hoedt said he understood the concern of the police that drug gangs might turn up, which is why the law needed to change. The Amsterdam meeting was convened by academics and public health experts involved in a five-year research project, funded by the European commission, called Alice Rap (Addiction and Lifestyles in Contemporary Europe Reframing Addictions Project). It launched a policy brief unequivocally backing the legal regulation of cannabis. It rehearses the economic arguments \u2013 the costs of pursuing cannabis crimes versus the tax revenue from legal production \u2013 and the health arguments around separating cannabis from other drugs and checking on quality and strength. But the discussion was around not whether but how it should happen. &quot;We are talking about a drug that is still problematic but by prohibition you make the problem bigger than it is,&quot; said Dr Franz Trautmann of the Trimbos Institute \u2013 the Netherlands institute of mental health and addiction. The prevalence of cannabis in Europe is between 5% and 20%, he said, but appeared not to be affected by drug policy. Spain, France and Britain all have higher than average rates in Europe. &quot;We have to deal with and acknowledge it is used by so many people,&quot; he said, adding that a market existed that needed to be regulated. &quot;It touches security, public order and safety in society. We have created a situation which has contributed to organised crime. &quot;Cannabis is moving from prohibition to regulation. Tobacco, alcohol, gambling are moving from uncontrolled to regulation. If you see how tobacco or alcohol is regulated, it is similar to what we do with cannabis [no under 18s in coffee shops, not near schools, staff do not work in smoking rooms etc]. We know these measures are effective for tobacco. We are not able to ban the drug totally but we can control it better.&quot; A lone voice against regulation was that of Dr Susan Weiss, of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)in the USA, who has serious concerns about Colorado, which has ads for chocolate spread with &quot;medical marijuana&quot; and a free joint with a ski pass. &quot;Things are moving very quickly and I&apos;m afraid they are going to move even faster,&quot; she said. &quot;This is an issue that a lot of states are considering. Part of it is because they see all the tax revenue that could be generated. One of the concerns I have is that it could be shortsighted because they could be missing all the health harms. &quot;We have this idea that we know exactly what cannabis does because it has been around such a long time. But I don&apos;t think we have a full understanding.&quot; She is worried too about the effect on young brains and the combination of marijuana and alcohol, which NIDA is studying. Some experts think the international conventions will just wither away. Few think there is a chance of overturning them. Russia, China, Sweden, Japan and parts of Africa are among the nations that would block it. Trautmann says it is not good to ignore international conventions, &quot;but the more initiatives we get, the more potential we get to show that the regulations are not working and the more motivation and support we get to change something.&quot;", "sentences": ["In Amsterdam, long famous for its coffee shops, identifiable by pictures of marijuana outside and fumes wafting through the door, international experts gathering to discuss cannabis regulation said the international conventions, once so heavily policed by the US, would now be increasingly flouted.", "In Amsterdam and many, but not all, places in the Netherlands, the sale and use of cannabis is tolerated but not legal.", "The Amsterdam meeting was convened by academics and public health experts involved in a five-year research project, funded by the European commission, called Alice Rap (Addiction and Lifestyles in Contemporary Europe Reframing Addictions Project)."], "title": "Going to pot: legalised cannabis edges nearer in west after US states end ban", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/may/23/going-pot-cannabis-legalisation-us-states-end-ban", "tags": ["Cannabis", "Drugs policy", "Drugs", "Drugs trade", "Obama administration", "US news", "US politics", "World news", "Society", "Politics", "Health", "Colorado", "Uruguay", "Netherlands", "Spain", "Nick Clegg", "Science", "Medical research"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-24T06:39:00Z", "article": "Thailand&apos;s military has detained former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra in a military camp roughly two hours from Bangkok, as she and 190 other prominent politicians and activists were apprehended and banned from leaving the country. An initial wave of 155 detentions came a day after Thailand&apos;s army chief seized power in a coup declared necessary to &quot;restore order and normality&quot;. Local media reported that Yingluck had been taken to an army camp in Saraburi province, central Thailand, where she was expected to be held for three days, according to Naew Na news. &quot;We have detained Yingluck, her sister and brother-in-law,&quot; a senior military officer told Reuters. The two relatives have also held senior political posts. &quot;We will do so for not more than week, that would be too long. We just need to organise matters in the country first,&quot; said the officer. General Prayuth Chan-ocha, Thailand&apos;s acting premier, on Friday ordered 155 political leaders, including the Shinawatra clan and both pro- and anti-government protesters \u2013 to report to him at Thai army headquarters in Bangkok. Among them were the recently deposed premier Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan, as well as former labour minister Chalerm Yubamrung. Some have since been released but the whereabouts of many remains unknown. On Saturday another 35 names were added to the list of people ordered to hand themselves in. Yingluck had arrived at Bangkok base on Friday morning in a bulletproof vehicle surrounded by bodyguards, local media reported, but left after 30 minutes for another army facility, according to the Associated Press. It is believed that pro-government redshirt leaders who support the deposed Pheu Thai government may have been moved to different bases around the country to minimise the potential for any resistance to Thursday&apos;s military coup.     Former Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra meets her supporters on 7 May in Bangkok after being forced to step down. Photograph: Borja Sanchez Trillo/Getty Images    Friday&apos;s detention of such a large number of politicians and leaders is significant, not least because it involves the Shinawatra clan \u2013 a highly polarising family in Thailand. The 64-year-old leader of the group, Thaksin \u2013 a telecoms tycoon and former prime minister who was deposed in a 2006 military coup \u2013 was hugely popular among rural voters and lauded for his populist policies while in office. But he was equally derided by Bangkok&apos;s urban, pro-royalist elites, who accused him of cronyism and corruption. Despite being deposed eight years ago, Thaksin is at the forefront of the political turmoil that has seen 28 people killed and 700 injured since November, when protests against the Yingluck-led Pheu Thai party were sparked by a proposed amnesty bill that would have ushered in Thaksin&apos;s return to Thailand. The government has since been in a political deadlock, with anti-Thaksin forces fighting for the installation of a non-appointed leader, who would oversee vague reforms, and pro-Thaksin forces calling for elections. Pro-Thaksin parties have won every election since 2001. Now the army is at the helm and has promised to not only restore order, but to institute the reforms \u2013 but just how, and under what circumstances, has not yet been made clear. Thaksin&apos;s lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, issued a statement Friday warning that the army&apos;s &quot;illegal seizure of power&quot; could result in a dramatic power divide. &quot;The military coup carried out by the army of Thailand does not have any legitimacy nor does the army of Thailand have a mandate from the people of Thailand to govern the country,&quot; Amsterdam said. &quot;Those who have the mandate of the people of Thailand, secured through free and fair elections, are now considering the formation of a government in exile.&quot; On Friday evening, hundreds of protesters held a candlelit vigil in downtown Bangkok with banners reading &quot;No coup!&quot;, &quot;Let people vote&quot; and &quot;Military junta \u2013 get out!&quot;. A large group of soldiers initially attempted to disperse the crowd, before allowing them to hold the sit-in near the central MBK mall, local media reported. Minor scuffles were reported and some protesters were taken away for questioning, according to reports on Twitter. Earlier, unverified reports circulated that the military was attempting to detain redshirts in the north and north-east of the country. According to online news portal Khaosod, the army has also closed off a Thailand-Laos border crossing in an attempt to prevent them fleeing the country. Like Thaksin, army chief Prayuth is no stranger to coups: he was part of the junta that helped depose Thaksin, a takeover that helped cement a massive pro-Thaksin support base known as the United Front for Democracy, and eventually led to massive street battles between royalist yellowshirts and pro-Thaksin supporters in 2010, resulting in the deaths of nearly 100 people. Prayuth claimed that the takeover would help restore peace to the nation, but the Bangkok Post said in an editorial on Friday: &quot;It&apos;s the very act of a military takeover that is likely to \u2026 provoke acts of violence and possibly cause more loss of life. This coup is not the solution.&quot; Thursday&apos;s coup \u2013 the country&apos;s 19th since an absolute monarchy was abolished in 1932 \u2013 has been condemned by a number of human rights group and nations, including France, Japan, Australia, Germany, the EU, UN and US. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said there was no justification for the coup and called for the release of all detained politicians. Most analysts have said the situation in Thailand is unlikely to improve soon. &quot;The &apos;hardliner&apos; generals now run the show and we should expect [a] bad outcome,&quot; said a report by the Siam Intelligence Unit thinktank. &quot;The new junta government will run the country for one to two years. The worst possible scenario is a chronic civil war.&quot; By 6pm on Friday, some television channels had returned to normal broadcasting, after 24 hours of military programming. All television and radio stations in Thailand, including foreign ones such as the BBC and CNN, had been off-air, resulting, in some circumstances, in repeat scenes of Prayuth declaring the military coup played over and over. In a comedic act of defiance, some Thais took to the Facebook page of the government&apos;s new ruling body \u2014 the National Peace and Order Maintenance Council (NPOMC) \u2013 to request new singles be played over the airwaves, complaining that the nationalist bandstand songs with titles such as The Motherland&apos;s Cancer, had begun to grate. They also requested their favourite television shows be aired again, news website Prachatai reported. &quot;Please put the soap operas back on!&quot; said one Facebook user. &quot;I&apos;m so bored. 7-Eleven has been closed because of the curfew.

The novelist and performer caused a riot at the Moulin Rouge in 1907 when she simulated sex with another woman on stage. She seduced her stepson when he was 16, telling him: &quot;It&apos;s time you became a man.&quot; She had three husbands, two messy divorces and a string of lovers, both male and female. In 1924, when Paris hosted the Olympic Games, Colette met, and was captivated by, one of its participants: Jos\u00e9 Leandro Andrade. Their upbringings could not have been more different: Andrade was a Uruguayan footballer who had slept on a dirt floor in his childhood and spent little time at school. But Colette was not the only famous Frenchwoman smitten by Andrade. Josephine Baker, a succ\u00e8s de scandale on stage and screen and one of Colette&apos;s female lovers, also met Andrade during the Games. Baker, described by Ernest Hemingway as &quot;the most sensational woman anyone ever saw&quot;, was the biggest attraction in Paris in the 1920s when she performed topless in her banana skirt, and was the first African-American to star in a successful film, Zou Zou, in 1934. If Baker was the first black film star, Andrade was the first black icon in football \u2013 and this summer&apos;s World Cup in South America owes him a substantial debt. An imposing man of 6ft, Andrade was an accomplished musician and dancer who, some said, had worked as a gigolo in his youth. In the 1920s, when the Olympic Games was effectively a\u00a0world championship of football, he was winning over European audiences to such an extent that hundreds of thousands of people came to watch him play. Many more were denied the chance, locked out of the stadiums. He was the earliest example of a\u00a0sporting sex symbol and a football phenomenon who has been called &quot;the first Pel\u00e9&quot;. At the time Andrade shared, with Josephine Baker, the nickname awarded by the French press of &quot;the black pearl&quot;. He may have shared her bed, too. One thing is beyond doubt \u2013 his significance to the game. Not only was he the outstanding player of his era but, in the opinion of Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, one of the most respected academics ever to have written a\u00a0book about sport, Andrade was &quot;responsible more than anybody else in the first third of the 20th century for putting football on the map of international sports&quot;.     Josephine Baker who shared with Andrade the nickname of \u2018the black pearl\u2019. He may have shared her bed, too. Photograph: Walery/Getty    In Britain, that would come as a surprise to all but the most knowledgeable football fans. Andrade is barely known here, unlike two other World Cup greats from South America \u2013 Pel\u00e9 and Diego Maradona. There are two main reasons: first, there was no television coverage of football in Andrade&apos;s day. Second, England and the other Home Nations had nothing to do with the World Cup until the 1950s; nor did Britain compete in Olympic football in the 1920s. The four Home Nations resigned from Fifa, football&apos;s governing body, in 1928 over the &quot;evil&quot; of paying loss-of-earnings compensation to amateur international footballers at the Olympics. Uruguay&apos;s achievements went virtually unchronicled. When they won the first World Cup in 1930, the Times did not even record the fact. When Uruguay played their first game in the Olympic tournament of 1924 the people of Paris took little notice. A Sunday match between Italy and Spain at Stade de Colombes drew a\u00a0crowd of 20,000. When Uruguay faced Yugoslavia at the same stadium a day later, on 26 May, only a few hundred turned up, unaware they were about to witness something very special. Yugoslavia, having sent spies to watch a\u00a0Uruguay training session, predicted an easy win and apologised in advance for sending the South Americans home after only one game. Uruguay beat them 7-0. They had learnt of the presence of the spies and deliberately misplaced their shots and passes in training. Three days later, Uruguay defeated the United States 3-0. A Spanish correspondent, Enrique Carcellach, wrote: &quot;I\u00a0have been watching football for 20 years and have never seen any team play with the mastery of this Uruguay team. I did not suspect football could be brought to this degree of virtuosity, this artistic limit. They were playing chess with the feet!&quot; Italy&apos;s Gazzetta dello Sport wrote of Uruguay&apos;s &quot;musical phrasing&quot; on the pitch, of their &quot;stylistic perfection&quot;. The editor of L&apos;Equipe, Gabriel Hanot, who had himself played at international level, said Uruguay&apos;s players were &quot;like thoroughbreds next to farm horses&quot; in comparison to north European players. Word quickly spread, and 45,000 people saw Uruguay trounce France 5-1 in the quarter-finals. In the semis there were nearly six times more spectators at Uruguay&apos;s tie than there were at the other tie. At the same time, Andrade was becoming the darling of women from the highest circles of Parisian society. Colette was one of several writers who attended a party at the football team&apos;s headquarters, a villa in the Paris suburb of Argenteuil, to celebrate a win against the United States in which Andrade was the outstanding player. She was sent to write an article for Le\u00a0Matin, where her former husband \u2013 and father of the boy she seduced \u2013 was editor. &quot;She was there by obligation and acted indifferently,&quot; said an eyewitness account, published in Uruguay in 1953. An Argentine orchestra, in Paris to perform at a popular musical, was playing, and Andrade was there to dance. &quot;Mme Colette started to open her eyes,&quot; wrote the anonymous eyewitness. &quot;Her interest turned to enthusiasm when Andrade and [teammate Alfredo] Zibechi, in costumes and to the sound of drums, started demonstrating the dances\u2026 She ended the party eating asado [barbecued beef], Uruguayan-style, spearing the meat on the point of her knife.&quot; Colette&apos;s report of the party in Le Matin said: &quot;Uruguayans are a\u00a0strange combination of civilisation and barbarism. Dancing &apos;le tango&apos; they are wonderful, sublime, better than the best gigolo. But they also dance African cannibal dances that make you shiver.&quot; She also said her beef had come from a cow cooked in a hole in the ground while it was still alive. Nonsense, but it all added to the allure of the football team not just from another continent, but from another world.     Compared to Europeans, Uruguay\u2019s footballers were \u2018like thoroughbreds next to farm horses\u2019. The Uruguayan team playing to an empty stadium in 1924. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty    According to an Italian report, Andrade frequently left the team&apos;s villa during the 1924 Games. Officials, fearing he would get lost or drunk, sent his roommate, Angel Romano, to find him. &quot;A few hours later he found Andrade in a luxury apartment in one of the most exclusive areas of the city, surrounded by beautiful women, like a sultan in his harem.&quot; On one of these excursions Andrade met Josephine Baker and danced a tango with her. He may or may not have had an affair with her. As with so many stories of his life, there is a blurring between fact and fiction. Was his father really 98 years old when Andrade was born? Did the footballer really work as gigolo for a while? Was it colliding with a\u00a0goalpost that blinded him in one eye, or was it syphilis? Perhaps some answers will emerge in a new book about the early days of Uruguayan football \u2013 From Train to Tango. The Style of Uruguayan Football, 1891-1954 by Aldo Mazzucchelli, a professor of Latin American literature \u2013 to be published by Taurus in Montevideo this year and under consideration for an English translation. A\u00a0capacity crowd saw Uruguay thrash Switzerland 3-0 in the Olympic final on 9 June. After the Olympics had finished he was invited to stay in Paris. Some say he was &quot;abducted&quot; by a wealthy woman who gave him a home for a month. He returned to Uruguay a\u00a0changed man. &quot;He went to Paris as a nobody, but after he got the hang of it he enjoyed it like nobody else,&quot; said Mazzucchelli. &quot;He became a\u00a0dandy and returned home from that trip wearing yellow gloves, an expensive coat, leather boots, a silk cravat and a nice top hat.&quot; Andrade played mostly at half-back, from where he dominated games, busy in both halves of the pitch. A more recent equivalent might have been Zinedine Zidane, a World Cup winner with France in 1998, Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht of Stanford University has suggested, writing about Andrade in In Praise of Athletic Beauty in 2006: &quot;All eyewitnesses were enchanted with the effortless elegance in his movements.&quot; He was muscular and powerful. There was a &quot;sensational athletic energy&quot; about his performances, which &quot;awakened strong waves of an almost erotic desire&quot;. He was famed for never celebrating a\u00a0goal, and for frequently missing training sessions. When Andrade arrived home, the black community of Montevideo arranged a party in his honour. He caused great offence by not turning up. Team- mates found him hard to know, arrogant. He never courted public favour, which may have counted against him later in life. &quot;By all accounts he was a difficult man,&quot; said Mazzucchelli, &quot;very full of himself, and nobody seemed really able to reach him.&quot; A\u00a0tour of nine European countries by Nacional, Andrade&apos;s Uruguayan club side, in 1925 attracted a total of more than 800,000 spectators. Andrade played only half of that tour. He went to a\u00a0doctor in Brussels and was told he had syphilis. He is said to have disappeared to Paris on hearing the news. He did not return to Montevideo until two months later. On his arrival, a reporter said he had lost weight and had &quot;an air of depression&quot; about him. Andrade said he was feeling &quot;somewhat ill&quot; and would undergo a course of treatment. Remarkably, he played on. He had lost some of his pace, but none of his skill. When Uruguay&apos;s entertainers reached the Olympic final in Amsterdam in 1928, more than 250,000 applied for tickets \u2013 10 times the stadium&apos;s capacity. Uruguay beat Argentina 2-1, but in the semi-final against Italy, Andrade had run into a goalpost and, some said, the injury was so serious he was later blinded in one eye. Others said his deteriorating health in later life, and his blindness, was caused by syphilis.     'By all accounts he was a difficult man, very full of himself, and nobody seemed really able to reach him': Andrade pours a glass of beer for a teammate in Amsterdam in 1928. Photograph: Getty    Andrade was slower still when Uruguay hosted the first World Cup in 1930, but he played in every game, and well enough to be named in the Fifa &quot;team of the tournament&quot;. He was, once more, a national hero after Uruguay once again beat Argentina in the final. That was Andrade&apos;s last appearance for his country. After playing on for several more seasons for clubs in Uruguay and Argentina, he had to find work. While his former teammates became successful coaches, businessmen and broadcasters, Andrade drank too much and was unable to hold down a steady job. He suffered from poor health, a troubled marriage and depression. He was invited to the World Cup in Brazil in 1950 as a guest of honour. His nephew, Victor Rodriguez Andrade, who added the second family name in honour of his illustrious uncle, was in the victorious Uruguay team. But in 1956 a German journalist, Fritz Hack, went in search of Andrade in Montevideo. After six days, Hack found him living in &quot;horrible&quot; conditions in a dilapidated basement flat. Andrade was too drunk to understand Hack&apos;s questions. Within a year football&apos;s first international superstar died, penniless and alcoholic, in an asylum in Montevideo. He was 56. Salto, a regional capital in the north of Uruguay, is an unremarkable place, noted for its cattle and citrus fruit. And its footballers. On 14 June there will be a feeling of great civic pride among Salto&apos;s 100,000 inhabitants. That is the date of Uruguay&apos;s first match in the World Cup in Brazil, when the two most celebrated players wearing the light blue shirt will be, in the words of mayor German Coutinho, &quot;beloved sons of Salto&quot;. Luis Su\u00e1rez of Liverpool, the current footballer of the year in England and top scorer in the Premier League, was born in Salto on 24 January 1987. Three weeks later along came Edinson Cavani, who may further lift the profile of Uruguayan football in this country next season. His club, Paris Saint-Germain, is expected to sell him this summer to either Manchester United or Chelsea. A civic reception is being planned to mark the announcement of Su\u00e1rez and Cavani \u2013 who play against England on 19 June \u2013 as &quot;Outstanding Citizens&quot; and international ambassadors for Salto. Nobody in the mayor&apos;s office has ever given a thought to honouring Andrade. But he, too, was born here, in 1901. He was registered as illegitimate, though it was widely believed that the man who signed as witness to his birth, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Andrade, was his father. The elder Andrade apparently escaped slavery in Brazil, having been transported across the Atlantic from west Africa, and was said to have had magical powers. He was also thought to be 98 at the time of Jos\u00e9 Leandro&apos;s birth. Teams who win the World Cup are entitled to display a gold star on their shirts. Brazil have five, Italy four and, thanks to the Olympic Games, Uruguay also have four. Fifa recognise that the two tournaments before the first World Cup in 1930 were effectively world championships. If individual players were awarded stars, Pel\u00e9 would have three, having been a world champion with Brazil in 1958, 1962 and 1970, and so would Andrade and three of his teammates in those winning teams from 1924, 1928 and 1930. Andrade&apos;s name bears comparison with Pel\u00e9, with Maradona, and certainly with Su\u00e1rez and the great Argentine Lionel Messi, neither of whom has ever won a World Cup. Perhaps, at some point, Jos\u00e9 Leandro Andrade will become, posthumously, an &quot;Outstanding Citizen&quot; too.", "sentences": ["When Uruguay&apos;s entertainers reached the Olympic final in Amsterdam in 1928, more than 250,000 applied for tickets \u2013 10 times the stadium&apos;s capacity.", "'By all accounts he was a difficult man, very full of himself, and nobody seemed really able to reach him': Andrade pours a glass of beer for a teammate in Amsterdam in 1928."], "title": "Before Pel\u00e9 there was Andrade", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/24/before-pele-there-was-andrade", "tags": ["Pel\u00e9", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-24T17:30:00Z", "article": "You have to pay attention at Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum to realise it is inviting the public to witness the death of old Europe. The Dutch don&apos;t know it. They have spent \u20ac370m refurbishing its 19th-century halls and the museum now shines as one of the world&apos;s great cultural centres. Nor do funereal sentiments greet the millions of visitors. They are welcomed instead by two over-confident English philosophers, who have splattered their thoughts over gallery walls like middle-brow graffiti artists. It is as if the culture ministry of a totalitarian state has taken control. The curators allow Alain de Botton and his collaborator, John Armstrong, to boom that art is a therapy that can make you a better person from 150 signs, designed as super-size Post-it notes. Slogans and instructions blare at the visitor in every room. You are told how art can heal and ennoble, if and only if, you look at it in the right way. The critics have been unrelenting. In the Dutch press, Bianca Stigter put it best when she said the Rijksmuseum was presenting art as cod liver oil: the nastier it tasted the more good it did you. Her colleague Wieteke van Zeil made the essential argument that the job of a gallery was to give people the space to think, not to tell them what to think. The British press has been no less condemnatory. I am not disagreeing. The moral exhortations and cautionary tales the Rijksmuseum offers are historically ignorant, visually illiterate and brazenly propagandistic. From Michael Gove to radical feminists, the old dream persists that if only you censor everything from the history curriculum to classical texts, you can produce a new model citizenry. The late Robert Hughes had the best reply. He gave the purveyors of moral uplift of his day the story of Sigismondo Malatesta, Lord of Rimini. Malatesta was without doubt a prince of exquisite taste, who patronised the finest artists of Renaissance Italy. Art did not exalt him, however, for he was so famed for his cruelty that the Catholic church made him for a time the only man apart from Judas Iscariot officially listed as being in hell \u2013 &quot;a distinction he earned by trussing up a papal emissary, the 15-year-old bishop of Fano, and publicly sodomising him before his applauding army in the main square of Rimini&quot;. Yet despite the justifiable criticism, the Rijksmuseum still performs a public service. It is presenting a recognisable moral philosophy: the philosophy of the Protestant middle class, which for all its setbacks and changes, has dominated northern Europe for centuries. Here is its sermon, condensed for reasons of space \u2013 and because I find a little of Mr de Botton goes a long way. There is nothing wrong with being rich, as long as you are just, wise and generous. You should value your friends \u2013 this next to Rembrandt&apos;s The Night Watch \u2013 because they bring out the best in you. Don&apos;t worry if you are not beautiful or distinguished \u2013 this appears by Rembrandt&apos;s The Jewish Bride, a portrait of a not particularly good-looking couple holding each other with great tenderness. If only one person loves you, you can ignore the rest of the world. A 17th-century still life of a succulent lobster surrounded by fruit and pies prompts the thought that modern consumerism has dulled our senses because it gives us luxuries on the cheap. We no longer enjoy a feast as our 17th-century ancestors did, because our greed is too easily satisfied and we take high living for granted. A picture of the worthy men who sat on the board of Amsterdam&apos;s women&apos;s prison in the 1690s brings forth the lesson that we should not be cynics. If you assume the worst of people in power, you will get the worst people taking power. Warnings are dotted through the museum like slow down signs near a busy junction. You should not give way to rage and despair whatever troubles life brings. You should not let familiarity with your partner breed contempt and be grateful that he or she loves you. You should not celebrate artists or rock stars but demand portraits of &quot;accountants, tram drivers and IT managers&quot; in order to recognise the importance of their efforts to keep society functioning. Think what you will about the quality of the writing, but there is much to be said for taking pleasure in what you have and who you are with. Better to be modest and realistic than to lust after unattainable dreams. In Britain, we assume that this old morality still holds; that north Europeans are prudent and thrifty. We think of them valuing education and manufacturing, unlike we Americanised Brits with our funny-money men, celebrity obsessions and desire to have it all and have it now. We haven&apos;t noticed the death of that Europe. The Dutch have borrowed to an extent that would make the most greed-driven Anglo-Saxon shudder. They have more debt than the Portuguese, the Irish or Greeks and much more than the British. Only the Danes from supposedly sensible Scandinavia can compete with their average household debt of 240% of disposable income. The property market they threw money at has been stagnant since 2008 and no one knows what to do. Once the solid men and women who staff the Dutch state might have been able to help their fellow citizens. Holland&apos;s national debt is modest and it has a current account surplus. But it has joined the euro and has given away control of the economic tools that might help it in a crisis. There&apos;s little a supposedly democratic society can do to take charge of its destiny. As the old order fails, new forces replace it. Optimists say that Geert Wilders will perform poorly when Holland&apos;s European election results come in today. He went too far even for the Dutch far right when he cried to a crowd in the Hague : &quot;In this city and in the Netherlands, do you want more or fewer Moroccans?&quot; &quot;Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!&quot; the mob roared. &quot;Then we&apos;ll arrange that.&quot; But however he fares, elsewhere in Europe the far right and far left are prospering because, in the name of federalism, the descendants of those moderate and cautious burghers whose stern portraits hang in the Rijksmuseum went wild and let their countries take part in a disastrous economic experiment. I don&apos;t know what art will come from the new Europe, but I am certain that pat philosophers will not be able to tell comforting children&apos;s stories about it.", "sentences": ["You have to pay attention at Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum to realise it is inviting the public to witness the death of old Europe.", "A picture of the worthy men who sat on the board of Amsterdam&apos;s women&apos;s prison in the 1690s brings forth the lesson that we should not be cynics."], "title": "A hollow European culture is writ large in Amsterdam | Nick Cohen", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/24/death-of-culture-writ-large-at-rijksmuseum", "tags": ["Museums", "Netherlands", "Rembrandt", "World news", "Europe", "Culture", "Art", "Art and design", "Alain de Botton", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-25T17:47:11Z", "article": "The king of Thailand is expected to endorse the leader of the military coup that placed the army in control of the nation, it emerged on Sunday, amid growing protests against the military takeover and widespread detention of activists and academics. News of the king&apos;s move, delivered through local media, came the same day that the junta dissolved the country&apos;s last remaining democratic institution \u2013 the senate \u2013 and ordered dozens of activists and journalists to turn themselves in to the army. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 86, who is ailing and frail, is not expected to attend the a royal ceremony on Monday morning at the Royal Thai Army headquarters in Bangkok. But his endorsement will give legitimacy to the junta&apos;s new government and allow its leader \u2013 army chief and acting prime minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha \u2013 to establish an interim constitution and legislative and reform committees. Under the name of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), the junta has brought sweeping changes in a matter of days. On Thursday, it dissolved the lower house of parliament and suspended the constitution - one Gen Prayuth had previously helped draw up during the last military coup in 2006. By emptying out both the house and senate, junta can bypass the need for parliamentary approval of new laws. By late on Saturday the junta had also announced it had dissolved the senate and would be assuming control of all lawmaking powers. Several hours earlier, it had summoned 35 prominent academics and activists to report to army headquarters in addition to some 155 leading politicians and leaders it had already called in for questioning. The council has also sacked the police chief and head of the Department of Special Investigations \u2013 Thailand&apos;s FBI. On Sunday afternoon it called in the editors of 18 major Thai newspapers - among them Khaosod, the Bangkok Post, ASTV, Matichon and Thairath - according to the online news portal Prachatai. It was not clear if the editors would be allowed to leave or detained in unknown locations like those arrested earlier. In a separate summons, the outspoken columnist Pravit Rojanaphruk, who writes for English-language paper the Nation, was asked to meet independently with the junta and said on Sunday morning he was en route to army headquarters. &quot;On my way to see the new dictator of Thailand. Hopefully the last,&quot; he tweeted. He did not appear to have been released by Sunday evening. More than 100 people remain in military detention in secret locations in what has been seen as a push to suppress dissent and potential opposition to the military takeover. Those who refuse to answer the army&apos;s summons are under threat of being court martialled, facing a two-year prison sentence and a fine. &quot;What is scary now is that the army appears to be the most united institution in Thai society,&quot; said Paul Chambers of the institute of south-east Asian affairs, which is affiliated to Chiang Mai University. Former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, had been taken into custody on Thursday but was released on Saturday. A military source from the junta told CNN that Shinawatra had been asked to &quot;help us maintain peace and order and not to get involved with protesters or any political movement.&quot; Thailand&apos;s army said it seized power to restore peace and order after six months of political infighting left 28 people dead and more than 700 injured after anti-government protesters, calling for reforms, attempted to overthrow the Shinawatra-led government. The Shinawatra clan is a polarising family in Thailand. Its billionaire leader, Thaksin, a former premier deposed in 2006, now lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai. His supporters have fought bloodily with his critics for eight years and some observers say that the current military detentions could be seen as an attempt to &quot;purge&quot; the nation of any Shinawatra influence. But the coup leaders are also facing trouble in southern Thailand, where at least 10 bombs exploded on Saturday, reportedly killing three people and wounding 63. An Islamic insurgency has been under way in the south for a decade. Troops were deployed across central Bangkok on Sunday, concentrated around the shopping malls of Rajprasong, and later Victory Monument, to dispel a growing crowd of protesters defying a public ban on anti-coup gatherings. The crowd shouted at the soldiers, held up banners and called for elections and a return to democratic rule.           Similar &quot;pop-up&quot; protests have taken place in the northern city of Chiang Mai, a political stronghold for the now-deposed Pheu Thai party, as well as in the beach resort of Pattaya and at Khon Kaen in the north-east. But they are matched, at least in Bangkok, with &quot;pro-coup&quot; protesters who claim to support the junta and meet under the banner name of &quot;We love the army&quot;. Many of the activists and academics told to report to the junta appear to have been outwardly critical of Thailand&apos;s l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law \u2013 known as Article 112 \u2013 which calls for up to 15 years&apos; imprisonment for defamatory, insulting or threatening comments about the royal family. Critics claim it stifles public debate and helps to maintain the status quo. The junta has also said that all l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 and sedition cases will now be tried in army courts. Recent attempts to reform the law have met fervent resistance by royalists, among them Prayuth, who according to the Associated Press told critics: &quot;If you guys play hardball I&apos;ll have no choice but to do so too.&quot; A 10pm-5am curfew still stands across the nation and about 14 Thai TV channels and radio stations are still off-air. Some websites have been shut down and some international channels, like BBC and CNN, are still inaccessible on certain providers. Chambers said the speed at which the junta was instituting change was &quot;very worrisome&quot; and that the immediate future for Thailand looked bleak. &quot;I see more jailings. I see the enshrinement of more army power. I see the beginning of civil war after Thaksin announces a government in exile,&quot; he said.

The Tories and Liberal Democrats agreed in 2010 to introduce the nationwide scheme, which involves A&amp;E departments sharing anonymised information about violent incidents with police forces, allowing problem spots to be targeted. But as few as a third of A&amp;E departments in England have fully adopted the programme, which was pioneered in Cardiff 20 years ago and has been copied as far afield as South Africa and the US. Department of Health officials have made it clear that A&amp;Es ought to share information with police, but a spokesperson admitted it simply did not know how many hospitals were operating the model. It is undertaking a review this summer to find out. Dr Adrian Boyle, chair of the quality in emergency care committee of the College of Emergency Medicine (CEM), said he was frustrated at the lack of progress. &quot;The implementation is not working as well as we would have liked,&quot; he said. &quot;It is frustrating.&quot; Boyle, an A&amp;E consultant who has worked closely with the Department of Health and NHS England to get the system up and running, called for the government to give hospitals incentives to introduce the scheme. He said there was a wariness within hospitals about staff to liaising with professionals &quot;out of their silo&quot;. The reorganisation of the NHS may also have hampered the programme, he said. An audit two years ago found two-thirds of A&amp;E departments were not sharing data to the standard recommended by the CEM. Boyle said he did not believe the new audit would show any progress. The architect of the original Cardiff scheme, Jonathan Shepherd, professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the Cardiff school of dentistry, expressed concern at the slowness of the adoption of the model. He said there was still too great an acceptance of &quot;routine&quot; street violence. &quot;People become immune to the issue and the social disaster it represents. For medical staff, police and local authority workers it becomes a routine part of what happens when you&apos;re on shift at the weekend. &quot;Professionals are used to being reactive, suturing people up and arresting offenders rather than taking a more preventative approach. I&apos;m not surprised it&apos;s taking some hospitals so long [to adopt the Cardiff model] and others aren&apos;t doing it\u00a0properly.&quot; Shepherd&apos;s idea stemmed from research he did in the 1980s which found only a quarter to a third of violent incidents resulting in a trip to A&amp;E come to the attention of the police. He realised that for forces to have a full picture of what was happening they ought to know about all cases of emergency treatment. His scheme \u2013 the Cardiff violence prevention programme \u2013 launched in 2003. Hospital staff recorded anonymised details of where, when and how a victim had been attacked. This information was shared, allowing maps of violence hotspots to be produced and the organisation of operations to tackle the problem. The results were striking. Within five years there were an estimated 42% fewer woundings in the Welsh capital compared with similar cities. There was a 35% decrease in the number of patients seeking emergency treatment and one study put the savings in economic and social costs at just under \u00a37m a year. For every \u00a31 spent on the scheme, \u00a382 was saved. Shepherd said he realised the scheme was working when the rate of violence in Cardiff, a popular party city, dropped to levels seen in towns such as Eastbourne and Harrogate. Shepherd suggested the government needed to do more to fulfil its coalition agreement promise. He said: &quot;In the runup to the 2015 election I think people will want to be reassured that this government commitment has come to fruition.&quot; Shepherd&apos;s model or variations of it are in place in Amsterdam and the Western Cape in South Africa. Milwaukee in the US has also been investigating it. Alun Michael, a former Labour minister and now police commissioner for south Wales, was also surprised that more hospitals had not adopted the model. &quot;Analysing incidents which brought victims of violence to A&amp;E has led to significant and sustained reductions in the number and seriousness of violent incidents,&quot; he said. Gary Smith, the director of Cardiff Street Pastors, which helps keep revellers safe in the city centre on Friday and Saturday nights, said he had noticed a difference in the city over recent years. &quot;It feels a safe, place to be now. I think that&apos;s partly because everyone works together so well now.&quot; Michael and Smith both said the programme in Cardiff had led to a wider cultural shift with agencies more used to working closer and better together. South Wales police made it clear it believed the scheme was worthwhile. A police spokesperson said the scheme had made a &quot;significant contribution&quot; to the reduction in violent crime. &quot;It is an excellent example of how partnership work in Cardiff is making a real difference to keeping our communities safe.&quot; There are examples that show the scheme has worked well in other places where it has been adopted. In some, violent crime has fallen by 40%. In Cambridge, for example, analysts realised foreign students were being injured on Monday evenings after Addenbrooke&apos;s hospital shared information. Officials found that drinks promotions aimed at foreign students were being offered by bars. The premises were told they should stop such promotions. In the south-east of England, people started attending an A&amp;E having been hit by planks of wood and bricks. The data was passed on and council officials realised an open skip had been left near a nightclub. Such skips were banned from the area. Mark Bellis, who advises the World Health Organisation on violence prevention who has implemented a successful information sharing scheme in the north west of England, said there remained a reticence in some places to take it up. &quot;It can work phenomenally well but some are reluctant because of the investment and the time.&quot; Caroline Shearer, of the anti-knife campaign group Only Cowards Carry said the government needed to do more to tackle violent crime \u2013 including making sure hospitals shared information. &quot;The government talks tough, it needs to act tough,&quot; she said. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: &quot;We have been clear A&amp;E departments must share information with police and we are about to review compliance ahead of the rollout of a new legal standard which all major A&amp;Es will be obliged to meet.

Deep brain stimulation is a procedure by which electrodes are implanted into specific parts of the brain. When these electrodes are connected to an outside battery pack, they send a pattern of localised pulses which act like a pacemaker to regulate activity in that region. Doctors at the University of Amsterdam implanted the device into Mr B&apos;s nucleus accumbens, a part of the brain which processes rewards and pleasurable behaviour \u2013 and which, when not functioning correctly, can be the cause of addictive or compulsive disorders. Within six weeks, it was clear the surgery had been effective. Mr B reported a sharp decline in anxiety and compulsive behaviours. The authors of the case study report note that he began to call himself &quot;&apos;Mr B II,&apos; the new and improved version of himself.&quot; Over the course of the next six months, an unexpected side effect started to emerge. It first happened, according to the report, when Mr B happened to hear the Johnny Cash song Ring of Fire on the radio. &quot;From this moment on,&quot; the report says, &quot;Mr B kept listening simply and solely to Johnny Cash and bought all his CDs and DVDs.\u201d When listening to his favourite songs, the report adds, Mr B felt like he was the hero in a movie, and although he played Johnny Cash songs almost exclusively for the following years, the music never annoyed him. His favourite songs are Fulsom Prison Blues, Ring of Fire and Sunday Morning Coming Down. However, when the batteries on the electrode implants run down, Mr B&apos;s musical taste returns to what it had been before the surgery: a few Dutch singers, and the Rolling Stones. Deep brain stimulation has been routinely used to treat Parkinson&apos;s since the mid-90s, and was first used for patients with severe OCD by doctors in Belgium in 1998. It is estimated that 100,000 patients worldwide now wear the device. Dr Ali Rezai, a neurosurgeon who routinely performs deep brain stimulation implants, and also heads up the neuroscience program at Ohio State University, believes that Mr B may always have had the potential to be a Johnny Cash fan, but that it was a predilection that could only emerge when his disorder was being suppressed. \u201cWhereas before, his severe anxiety meant he was not able to connect with music,\u201d he told the Guardian, \u201cafterwards it could become rewarding for him. His brain wasn&apos;t functioning normally before.\u201d \u201cI don&apos;t know why he had a particular predilection for Johnny Cash,\u201d he added. \u201cMaybe it has a certain rhythm.\u201d", "sentences": ["Doctors at the University of Amsterdam implanted the device into Mr B&apos;s nucleus accumbens, a part of the brain which processes rewards and pleasurable behaviour \u2013 and which, when not functioning correctly, can be the cause of addictive or compulsive disorders."], "title": "Man develops powerful love of Johnny Cash following deep brain stimulation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/27/johnny-cash-deep-brain-stimulation-urge-listen", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Johnny Cash", "Country", "Neuroscience", "Medical research", "Science"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-29T15:29:00Z", "article": "The following is an extract from Leo Verheul\u2019s article from the forthcoming issue 13 of the Blizzard. The Blizzard is a quarterly football journal available from www.theblizzard.co.uk on a pay-what-you-like basis in print and digital formats. He must have been about 10 years old when I saw him playing for the first time. It was on a lazy Sunday afternoon in a children\u2019s playground in our neighbourhood, Kralingen, the most beautiful part of Rotterdam, a green area enclosed by the river Maas, the centre and Kralingse Bos en Plas, the biggest wood and lake in town. My three-year-old daughter was playing on the swing and the slide with other toddlers and I sat down in the sun to watch the older kids playing football in the cage, a small football pitch surrounded by wire mesh. I recognised one of them, Robin, the son of my friend Bob who was always talking about him, telling me how he was bound to be a global superstar and teasing me that I should write about him even when he was six years old. The rest of the kids were Moroccan. Much later I realised that two of them were Said Boutahar (Real Zaragoza and Al Wakrah) and Mounir Hamdaoui (AZ and Ajax), other kids who went on to be professionals. Robin always hung around with them. He spoke like them, with the same accent and the staccato way of speaking. He was one of them. And played like them, fixated on doing a new trick, fixated on doing a panna (a nutmeg). I enjoyed watching them play. They didn\u2019t fight to win, but for enjoyment and entertainment. And my friend\u2019s son was the best. Every ball he touched, with his left foot, exclusively the left, was like he was caressing his girl. He mixed slow and speedy moves like a bartender his cocktails. And at kicking the ball he was brilliant. And then it happened. One of the kids blocked an opponent and the ball was launched up to the stars and landed in a garden next to the cage. At once we heard some animal growling. An enormously fat creature, apparently drunk, came out of his house shouting, \u201cYou African bastards! I told you to fuck off \u2026\u201d But just as he bent over to confiscate the ball, one of the kids jumped over the barrier into the garden, pulled the ball with his left foot towards his heel, and flicked the ball up to grab it away from the fat guy. The fat guy was furious and made to kick the hell out of the boy but the kid was too quick and leapt away with great elegance. Footballing ability saved him. The fat guy, having swung too hard, lost balance. He spun 180 degrees and collapsed with a terrible cracking of bones. He lay, screaming, in the garden and the boys ran away. They had no reason to: they were entitled to play there and they\u2019d been attacked by a drunken racist. \u201cI was there! I was there!\u201d Robin shouted, jumping up from his seat when, years later, I visited him in London where he was slowly making his mark at Arsenal, breaking into the team of Dennis Bergkamp, Robert Pires and Thierry Henry. \u201cThat fat guy was always nagging, insulting and bothering us,\u201d he said. \u201cHe broke his leg all by himself. But after that incident we chose another playground nearby.\u201d ********* From being just a friend\u2019s son he became a local phenomenon, who drew special attention. I saw him frequently on the street, always with a ball, always. Going to school, he would have the ball at his feet, making feints against every lamppost on his way. Going to the shop for his father, he would keep the ball up, preventing it from touching the ground. But he didn\u2019t stop when he entered the store. With the ball in the air, he grabbed what his father had ordered, paid and went off, the ball still dancing. The owner of the shop was an extremely friendly Pakistani man, who smiled an almost offensive amount. He liked Robin but sometimes he lost his smile. Robin had a habit of dribbling with the ball through the store making pannas on customers. Some people hated that, were scared or irritated, but the kid just couldn\u2019t resist. Or, balancing the ball in the air, he would kick it gently with his heel against the large window of some bar, shop or office, take it smoothly and walk on. Behind him you saw the heads of surprised people asking themselves what the noise had been. \u201cFootball has always been my great love,\u201d Van Persie says today. \u201cI slept with a ball \u2013 really! Even when I started going out with Bouchra \u2013 ouha! She must have thought, \u2018What\u2019s this...?\u2019 When I was five, I joined a club, Excelsior, the club of Kralingen, in the first division. I was always training. On a free afternoon I did individual work with Aad Putters, my youth trainer. Not with the idea growing to be a star, but for fun. I didn\u2019t want to do anything else. When friends wanted to go to the centre of town, they took a bus or tram. I took the ball and went running after them. School was hell, because I had to put the ball on the ground. Outside I was free, playing the ball.\u201d In the early 90s, I began to believe the story Bob had told me years earlier when he was still married to Jos\u00e9, an artist like himself. Jos\u00e9 was a painter, Bob was dedicated to sculptures. A fortune-teller told him he would have three children, first two daughters and then a son. \u201cWhen it comes true,\u201d a disbelieving Bob said to the woman, \u201cI\u2019ll come back to you to hear the rest \u2026\u201d Two weeks after Robin\u2019s birth in August 1983 (coming as brother to Lily and Kiki), he went back to the fortune-teller and she told him that his son would struggle at school but would be a king on the pitch: \u201cA football star is born. He will be rich and famous.\u201d Bob wasn\u2019t convinced, but he wanted to believe the woman. When Robin began to walk, he started having him practise with balloons, light and easy, like balls in slow motion. Then there came a gap. The marriage with Jos\u00e9 broke up and Bob moved out. Years later, when Robin was nearly six years old, Jos\u00e9 stood in Bob\u2019s doorway. Bob was then living in the Jaffadwarsstraat, in a modest but cosy home at the back of Kralingen. Alone. Jos\u00e9 was desperate. \u201cCan Robin live with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe\u2019s unmanageable and only wants to deal with you.\u201d \u201cThe problem with the kid,\u201d Bob van Persie explained to me, \u201cwas that he was hyperactive. \u201cNot ADHD: then you have to be treated. Robin just had to use up his energy, that was all. At first he did a lot of mischief on the street. For the first time I had to be hard on him, punish him. Then he met his Moroccan bunch and found his soul-mates. From that moment he started to breathe, eat and dream football. That was the salvation. You know that he trained one of the younger teams of Excelsior when he was only 12 years old? Quite fanatically but just for fun. \u201cBesides eating and sleeping he was busy only with football. School was a huge problem. I was ordered to show up for the school board. They held me responsible for Robin\u2019s conduct, for him never paying attention and not doing homework at all: \u2018School is more important for his future than football, sir.\u2019 But Robin and I didn\u2019t agree \u2026\u201d     Robin van Persie's first club, Excelsior, has named a stand after the Holland international striker. Photograph: Graham Chadwick/Associated N/REX    At 13 years old, Van Persie joined Feyenoord, a top club with a more professional training set-up. After a couple of years he had emerged as a prime talent and, on 3 February 2002, he made his debut for the first team. A few months later, he played in the Uefa Cup final. Feyenoord won. The fans, at first, were crazy about him. Van Persie was a local hero in no time. On a national level, he was chosen as Talent of the Season for 2001-02. So far, so good. But suddenly, it all went wrong. As quickly as he\u2019d risen, Van Persie was knocked down again, his enemy Pierre van Hooijdonk ready to give the blow. On 31 March that year there\u2019d been an embarrassing clash between the two players in front of 50,000 fans when Feyenoord played RKC. Van Persie, having been in the team only just over a month, pushed his older team-mate away to take a free-kick to the right side of goal. As a left-footer, he thought he should be taking it. He produced a brilliant shot that forced the goalkeeper to turn the ball away from the very corner of his goal, but Big Pierre was furious, and so was the coach, Bert van Marwijk. Van Hooijdonk would not forget this humiliation and waited for his chance to get even. After winning the Uefa Cup, Van Persie started walking around with his head in the clouds. He developed an attitude. He didn\u2019t like the mid-range car made available for the players by sponsors and bought himself a trendy Mercedes sports car. In training and in matches, the rest of the squad began to be irritated by the non-conformist youngsters. Internationals like Van Hooijdonk and Paul Bosvelt made the rules. Kids like Van Persie had to shut up or they were kicked down and humiliated. But this new kid on the block was not like that. Before the start of the new season Van Hooijdonk and Bosvelt asked for a talk with the coach and demanded that Van Persie be treated properly. They wanted him relegated to the bench and he was. When Feyenoord qualified for the Champions League on 27 August 2002, after a tense game against Fenerbah\u00e7e, the situation exploded. 15 minutes before the end of the game Van Persie was sent by his coach to warm up. But after a couple of minutes he asked Van Persie to sit down, because \u2013 he thought \u2013 the forward wasn\u2019t motivated. Van Persie was furious and when Van Marwijk shook hands with everybody after the final whistle, he refused. It was the beginning of the end. For the next two years, he was at war. Van Marwijk later became national coach. Before working with Van Persie, they thrashed things out. Van Marwijk still believes he did the right thing. \u201cI was the first one to be hard on him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019d never been criticised in his youth. Hopefully, some day he will understand it was good for him. I put everything in place for him.\u201d It\u2019s probably a vain hope. \u201cI have never felt the trust of the people who didn\u2019t stop criticising me,\u201d Van Persie said. \u201cAt the end I sat on the bench at Feyenoord believing I wasn\u2019t good enough to be a number 10 and that I even was just an average left-winger. When people are always nagging you, you stop listening and become stubborn. When I made a mistake at Feyenoord they always tore hell out of me. It is possible to criticise constructively.\u201d Apparently, Van Persie has other ways of dealing with young players. \u201cWhen you had problems, Robin was always there for you,\u201d said his former Arsenal team-mate Carl Jenkinson. \u201cEspecially for the youngsters. He was approachable and always prepared to listen to the opinion of others. Also on the pitch he always set the right example. You could say he was the perfect captain.\u201d In the summer of 2002, Robin wasn\u2019t so old and wise. He had a long and hard way to go to the top, to be a perfect pro. Partly because he was a rebel and partly because of the questionable management of Van Marwijk, he lost two valuable seasons. Until 15 April 2004, he made no progress, playing only a handful of first-team games and turning out mostly for the seconds, Young Feyenoord. But 15 April 2004 would be a key date in his career. Young Feyenoord were playing Young Ajax, their biggest rivals. There were 4,000 fans there, clustering close to the players, who had no protection: no stewards, just low fences. The fanatical part of the Amsterdam public, drinking beer and smoking pot, jeered him, spitting at him, abusing him and throwing drinks over him. But Van Persie stayed calm and played superbly. He knew that Arsenal\u2019s chief scout, Steve Rowley, was watching him. Seeing him battling against a stronger team and aggressive spectators, Rowley decided he had seen enough.     It was during a Feyenoord v Ajax game that Robin van Persie was chased and beaten up be fans. Photograph: Robert Vos/AFP/Getty Images    Near the end, Van Persie scored to make it 1-1 and celebrated by blowing a kiss to the Ajax fans. After the final whistle, 40 thugs chased after him. He was punched and kicked and forced to the ground. Only with intense efforts from his team-mates and Ajax players was he freed and led to safety. \u201cI don\u2019t want to exaggerate,\u201d Van Persie said, \u201cbut I thought I was going to die. When you\u2019re unconscious on the ground and they stick a knife in you it\u2019s over. For a few weeks after I couldn\u2019t sleep, or I\u2019d wake up bathed in sweat after another nightmare. I had to do something and went to a psychotherapist who helped me out.\u201d Guus Hiddink, the manager of PSV, had been watching Van Persie for some time, but when Rowley called the day after the nightmare in Amsterdam, the decision was easy enough to make. Van Persie joined Arsenal. At the end of that year, I visited Van Persie in London. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had decided to bring him through slowly and my friend\u2019s son was playing for the second team, but he was talking now with laughter in his eyes. \u201cA few minutes chatting with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger were enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew I could trust this man. He is as crazy about football as I am. He says I am good but that I have to be patient. While negotiating he said to me, \u2018When you dribble past [Sol]Campbell and [Kolo] Tour\u00e9 in training, you can play!\u2019 That was all I wanted to hear. I gave Arsenal my word straightaway.\u201d He spoke enthusiastically about his new surroundings. \u201cThe first two months were hell,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to follow a special training regime with a guy called Tony, who\u2019d been in the navy. I was dead every night. But now I\u2019m training with Thierry, Pires, Bergkamp! I am only watching what\u2019s going on around me \u2026 filling myself like a sponge with everything I see. Pires had been injured and played with us in the second team. We had a combination knocking the ball over six players, all one touch \u2026 that\u2019s life, that\u2019s pure happiness! I\u2019m close, man, I\u2019m so close now. I am touching the sky, close to the top.\u201d But in the weeks that followed, I noticed from afar that Van Persie wasn\u2019t so close to the top. There were still a couple of lessons to be learned. At the beginning, there was Dennis Bergkamp, teaching Robin what to do and how to do it. Van Persie watched games over again to learn to be self-critical. Rowley told him there was something missing in his play \u2013 intelligence: there could be no risk in the midfield, only around the box \u2013 but that he had to find that out by himself. Rowley sent him a message after each game. Wenger, irritated by stupid yellow and red cards, was hard on him. Van Persie improved on the pitch but not in his private life. He rose, fell and got up all the time. Soon after winning the FA Cup with Arsenal and making his debut for the Dutch national team, Van Persie found himself in a nightmare. At the beginning of June 2005, he was arrested in Rotterdam and accused of rape. He was held in prison for a few weeks and then released on parole. After a night out, Van Persie had visited a hotel with a couple of friends and an erotic dancer, Sandra K. There was laughter, there was sex, but when the men hid her clothes as a joke, she left, irritated. Vitally, she didn\u2019t tell the people she met in the hours after the party that she\u2019d been raped, while a waiter at the hotel overheard her talking on the phone about the famous player she had been with. Later that day, she went to the police. Months later, a judge decided to throw out the case, concluding that there was no evidence of a crime and the woman\u2019s evidence was contradictory. The shame for Van Persie remained. It took years to restore his image and it almost cost him his marriage. But his Moroccan wife Bouchra remained loyal. She believed in him and fought for him from the moment the scandal broke, looking for the best lawyer she could find. \u201cMy love is hurt,\u201d she said, \u201cbut our friendship will survive it all.\u201d It would be the last scandal, the last lesson Robin had to learn: don\u2019t hustle, don\u2019t fool around, be there for the ones you love. In the years after the lowest point in his life, he paid back the loyalty of his wife and he paid back Arsenal, paid back Wenger, who had never stopped believing in him and also paid back Rowley, another key figure in his life. Van Persie was 21 and \u2013 finally \u2013 an adult. Just in time.     Robin van Persie spent eight years at Arsenal before moving to Manchester United in 2012. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images    Under Wenger, Van Persie developed into one of the best players in the world. He was twice Arsenal\u2019s player of the year and in 2012-13 he was Manchester United\u2019s, at least according to the fans\u2019 vote (the players went for Michael Carrick). He became the ideal professional. A loyal husband. (\u201cAfter all we have lived through, our relationship is stronger than ever.\u201d) A dedicated father to a son and a daughter. An example for young players. Three times he fought back from serious injuries. Five years ago, one of them almost ended his career. Sometimes people ask me: \u201cThe son of that friend of yours, Robin van Persie \u2026 what\u2019s he like?\u201d I answer: \u201cHealthy. Healthy in all kind of ways.\u201d Robin thinks healthily and lives healthily. He watches what he eats, takes the rest a player needs, doesn\u2019t smoke and never drinks alcohol. He has three activities. In order of importance, they are: his wife and children, football and table-tennis. He is boring in a spectacular way. \u201cAt home in Manchester, I have a recreation room, like I had in London. I have all kinds of shirts on the wall. In the middle is a table-tennis table. Everybody who comes to my home has to play at least one set against me. I beat them all. The best thing is when they want another set. People like me who can\u2019t stand not to win. I beat them again and again until they are furious, then I laugh. That\u2019s funny.\u201d Once he was on holiday in Marbellaand was a little bored, lying in the sun with all the family. \u201cSuddenly I heard: tac \u2026 tac \u2026 tac\u2026 \u201d Robin said. \u201cWow! The neighbours are playing table-tennis. I\u2019m saved! I grabbed my friend and we went there to ask if we could play. They were English people. They didn\u2019t mind. We didn\u2019t play against them \u2013 they weren\u2019t good enough. When we started playing you heard: \u2018tac-tac-tac-tac \u2026 \u2018\u2019 Ha! We played for an hour and then \u2026 pfff \u2026 the pressure was gone.\u201d That\u2019s typical Van Persie. He always worships the kid in himself. The artist. Not the money-maker. Not the collector of personal prizes. He is the player with the artist-blood of his parents in his veins. I remember a game two years ago. Van Persie was free in the box. He might have beaten AC Milan\u2019s goalkeeper Christian Abiatti. But instead of killing the ball directly, he preferred to caress the ball and attempt a stunning chip. Not a goal, but an everlasting memory for all his admirers. \u201cYou flatter me with this remark,\u201d Bob van Persie said, \u201cbut without being immodest I think it\u2019s true: Robin is first of all an artist on the field, more than a player. That\u2019s his main motivation. Making art, making history in his own special way.\u201d In the summer of 2012, Van Persie faced the biggest decision of his life: to leave Arsenal or not. \u201cIt was a dilemma,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved that club. The fantastic stadium. The public. The atmosphere. I am a real Gunner and will always be one. A part of me was hurt. But I am a winner. I always want to win and it was time to win some prizes with a club, some titles. \u201cI never would have gone for the money, but wanted the change to take my career a bit further. And it turned out to be the right decision. I won the title with Manchester United right away. And I must also say: Manchester United is a warm club. I feel happy there. It was the first time in my life that I became champion of a country. A dream. But the most beautiful thing about the title was the path towards the championship. It was like being on a train. It was fabulous.\u201d Van Persie is now the captain of Holland and in October 2013 he became his country\u2019s all-time leading scorer, surpassing Patrick Kluivert\u2019s record with a hat-trick against Hungary. \u201cIt was a fantastic moment,\u201d Van Persie said, \u201cespecially because my two kids were there. Normally matches are too late for them, but that time the two of them were there. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t realise exactly what happened, but it\u2019ll be wonderful to be able to talk about that memory in the future.\u201d     Robin van Persie will be Louis van Gaal's captain at the 2014 Brazil World Cup. Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images    Just before half-time, Van Persie scored his second to match Kluivert\u2019s tally. He ran to the bench and hugged Kluivert, who is now one of Louis van Gaal\u2019s assistants with the national team. \u201cI can\u2019t say what I felt in that moment,\u201d Van Persie said. \u201cKluivert\u2019s 40th exactly 10 years before. Patrick was keen to celebrate it with me. \u2018It\u2019s amazing you\u2019ve come that far. Now go on, champ!\u2019 he said. I had to celebrate that moment with him. In the second half I scored number 41. Van Gaal called me over and took me off the pitch. The public stood up and gave me a hell of an ovation. That\u2019s Van Gaal. I was injured in the days before, my little toe. Ridiculous, but very painful. A couple of days before the game it was still hurting. \u201cThe house-rule within the Dutch team is that you if you\u2019re in pain, you have to go home. But the coach made an exception for me. And that paid off. Sometimes every piece of the puzzle falls together. This was such a night.\u201d Holland had already secured their place in Brazil before that game, becoming the first nation to qualify. \u201cIn recent history, Holland have always been among the contenders for the World Cup,\u201d Van Persie said. \u201cWe have a great team. A good mix of experience, skill and young talent. For a lot of us it will be the last chance, the last cry of a generation. Players like me. Like Wesley Sneijder, Rapha\u00ebl van der Vaart and others. Personally, I\u2019m in my best period. Van Gaal gave me all the confidence I can ask for. He made me the main striker, my favourite position. At last. He made me captain. I owe him something. So I will be as sharp as a knife in Brazil. I will walk on fire for him if I have to. Like the rest of the team. We have a lot of options. Our coach has a lot of choices over there. I think we are going to do something special: like in 2010 but hopefully this time winning the final.\u201d Asked about the key to his success, Van Persie answered: \u201cI think my biggest strength is that I always keep doing exactly the same thing. There are forwards who go crazy in the euphoria, but after a goal I let myself fall back to midfield, getting some gas back, keeping myself cool and focused on my mission. And sometimes you are dry for weeks, but if you stop scoring goals for a while, don\u2019t panic. Take it easy. Stay relaxed. That next goal is only waiting to fall your way. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. In a bad period like that I also let myself drop to the midfield. By staying cool you give your mind the chance to cure your body. The human soul, the spirit, is much more important than the body. The modern player is judged by his results. I\u2019m always on a train: three big games a week. So I have to function like a machine. It\u2019s the only way to survive. That\u2019s why you have to be stable in the emotional process. You always must try to find the balance. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all is about. Keeping your train going.\u201d Van Persie is now 30 and nearing the end of his career, which he\u2019s already decided to finish with Excelsior, his first club. Van Persie is loyal. A couple of years ago, he donated a huge amount of money for youth training there. Excelsior named a stand after its most famous son. When he is in Rotterdam he always drops in. It\u2019s like home. But before that, what are his plans? \u201cWhen his contract ends in Manchester he\u2019ll be 33,\u201d said Bob. \u201cAs long as he\u2019s fit enough \u2013 and I\u2019m sure he will be \u2013 he\u2019ll stay in Manchester. Then he\u2019ll go back to Excelsior. Money will never be an issue. Robin is hyperactive. He was like that as a kid and always will be like that. He needs football to burn his energy and he\u2019ll be like that for the rest of his life. So he\u2019s got to look forwards. I think he\u2019ll probably always be loyal to Excelsior, Arsenal and Manchester United. Those clubs are like home. I think Robin will finish his career in Excelsior and then go back to London or Manchester as a coach. That will be his next goal in life: to be the best coach in the world. I hope we have to wait years for that moment. Let\u2019s enjoy watching him play a little more.\u201d I asked Van Persie if his dream had come true. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m where I always wanted to be.\u201d Then he looked outside, with a distant smile. \u201cI\u2019m still a kid. Still with a dream. I\u2019ll tell you something that happened the other day. I had lunch with Rio Ferdinand at the club when four kids, 10 years old or so, came in, players from the youth set-up. They were wearing nice training kit from United and they looked about curiously. In 10, 12 years maybe they\u2019ll play for the first team. I said to Rio: \u2018Look \u2026 those guys, still so young, that might be our most beautiful time. No worries. Cool being dressed in your training outfit all day long. Football shoes on all the time. Just playing along. On the street, indoors, on the pitch. Tired? Never. Muscular pain? Hardly ever. Maybe a day, once in a year \u2026 It\u2019s incredible how you recover as a kid. You couldn\u2019t imagine being injured, you just didn\u2019t know what that was.\u201d Then it was as though he&apos;d just woken up and he smiled that huge smile again. \u201cLeo,\u201d he said. \u201cMy most important dream is to stay as long as possible the kid that I still feel within me. That\u2019s what I am. And that is what I always want to be: just a kid with only one wish, to play football.\u201d     The Blizzard    The Blizzard is a 190-page quarterly publication that allows the best football writers in the world the opportunity to write about the football stories that matter to them, with no limits and no editorial bias.

Sir Simon Rattle conducts Robert Carsen&apos;s staging of Poulenc&apos;s opera based on the true story of the mass execution of Carmelite nuns during the French revolution. Carsen&apos;s production, seen all over the world since its Amsterdam premiere in 1997, dispenses with scenery and instead fills the stage with a seething mass of humanity \u2013 the populace, the revolutionary mob. This gives it the distinction of fielding the most people seen on stage in a Royal Opera production; its 167 participants just pip Die Meistersinger&apos;s 166. More intriguing than the sheer size of the cast, though, is its provenance. While the orchestra and singers have enjoyed elite musical educations en route to becoming internationally accomplished musicians, for others in the production the road to the Covent Garden stage has been somewhat different. Celeste B \u2013 &quot;You can say I&apos;m 60-plus&quot; \u2013 was previously homeless in London. A year ago, Michael B, 30, was serving a prison sentence for a firearms offence. Now they, and nearly 70 others \u2013 many of whom also have recent experience of homelessness, the criminal justice system or unemployment \u2013 have all made their Covent Garden debuts. While outreach and education projects are commonplace in artistic institutions, this was slightly different. There has been no pre-production publicity and &quot;there is no concession on quality,&quot; says Rattle. &quot;This is a Royal Opera production and the same standards of excellence apply to the new members of the cast as to the professionals. But without telling the audience the backgrounds of the people on stage, I think that somehow they will sense that this is something a\u00a0little different and these people do bring a different dramatic experience. The French revolution was about the real world impinging on another world that had become too isolated. There are obvious resonances. One of the most difficult things in opera is for people to suspend disbelief. What better way of putting the French revolution on stage than to bring in people who bring a whole new energy \u2013 sometimes not necessarily the most convenient energy \u2013 to the stage?&quot; The process of putting together the community ensemble began in January. It was a collaborative effort involving the charities Streetwise Opera, which uses music as a platform to help homeless people, the Synergy Theatre Project, which enables people who&apos;ve been involved in crime to get into the dramatic arts, as well as Job Centre Plus, and students from the Central School of Speech and Drama. &quot;My late father once said to me that it&apos;s OK to be down on your luck, but so long as you are not out you can always find a handhold to pull yourself up,&quot; said Celeste B. &quot;When I became homeless I went to St Martin in the Fields, where one of the staff asked if I wanted to go to a Streetwise opera workshop. I said, &apos;Not on your life.&apos; I&apos;d been told at school that I couldn&apos;t sing. But at Streetwise they said I was a natural alto, and I stayed. No matter how bad things are, they always could be worse. Streetwise was a good part of my life.&quot; Michael B says that during his prison sentence he needed to find something he &quot;loved and could commit to&quot;. As part of a day-release catering course, he was assigned to a job in the bar of Rada. &quot;When I was there, some of the students and staff said to me that I was an actor, but that I just didn&apos;t realise it. Before prison, I had no experience of acting at all. But if I&apos;m honest, I did use acting in my crimes. It was almost as if I was playing a character because I couldn&apos;t do it myself. In prison it was the same. You constantly have to adapt your character to different people and to different energies and situations. Say something wrong and things can escalate quickly.&quot; After his release, he made contact with Synergy theatre who directed him in the Royal Opera project. He also started to audition for drama schools. I&apos;ve been following the progress of the community ensemble since the first of their weekly rehearsals together in February. The early warm-up exercises could have come straight from middle-management bonding sessions: sit with someone you don&apos;t know; do a yawn from the whole of your body; pretend you&apos;re trapped in a bubble. Rehearsing the stage movements, later to be named Big Mess 1 and Big Mess 2, resulted in much bumping\u00a0into one another and general incompetence, the kind of scenes familiar to anyone who saw early episodes of Gareth Malone&apos;s The Choir. Art and practicalities got equal billing, with announcements about free travel cards\u00a0delivered alongside news of costume fittings. When Kasper Holten, Covent Garden&apos;s director of opera, welcomed the group to the house, he subtly raised the stakes by describing the eminence of the performers with whom the group would be working. He\u00a0then outlined the philosophy of the\u00a0scheme. &quot;If you&apos;re ever somewhere new and want to find the city centre, look for the opera house. They are always in the very centre. But too often there is a sense of losing touch with the city, and part of the reasoning behind this programme is to reconnect with the city we are part of.&quot;     The cast of Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites in rehearsal.  Photograph: Stephen Cummiskey    A month or so later, the camaraderie had grown almost palpably. Theatrical groans greeted the announcement that a tube strike would mean an early finish and therefore no tea break, while the phrase &quot;You are a revolting mob&quot; was still getting big laughs. The focus of the sessions was sharper, too. The group was told that, as the crowd, they were witnesses to, and participants in, the end of an era. Much of the instruction was about maintaining concentration in long scenes. &quot;It is not just those at the front communicating with people in the stalls,&quot; the group was told. &quot;The people at the back will be in communication with the circle and above. You will all be seen at all times. You cannot relax.&quot; Hitting marks on the right note had become much more important, while requests for silence from the production staff had a slightly testier edge. Speaking after this rehearsal, assistant director Hazel Gould, who has worked with many community groups, said she was pleasantly surprised at how well the ensemble had come together. &quot;What is unusual here is the disparate backgrounds. We had no idea how that would pan out, but it does feel like a company, and they are being very supportive of each other. My main anxiety is the interface between this group and the rest of the building. This is a well-oiled machine. It works incredibly well, and this project will involve a big change in working methods. Our next rehearsal is\u00a0with the chorus and professional actors, so I am fascinated, excited and scared about seeing what happens when everyone comes together.&quot; Royal Opera Chorus member John Bernays concedes there was some apprehension on the part of the professionals. &quot;There are the logistical issues of having a group that size in the\u00a0building, let alone in rehearsals. And having amateurs with little or no experience on a professional stage is something very unusual. Just being able to walk on and inhabit the same space every time is something we take for granted, but it actually can be tricky. Yet there was also a feeling that the project could be valuable to them, interesting for us and of course good for the piece. And just looking around the stage at their body language and presence, it is obvious that they get it and are really enjoying it.&quot; There was indeed a new atmosphere in the vast rehearsal room when they began to work with the chorus and principals. Members of Carsen&apos;s production team prowled the floor offering instructions. The space felt slightly less safe than it had been when only Gould was telling them what to do; asking a simple question took slightly more courage. The group&apos;s swaying and circling movements \u2013 not synchronised, but giving the impression of the huge cast as a single character \u2013 were tightened up as they were told to think about &quot;maggots in a jar&quot; and &quot;sharks swimming in a draining tank&quot;. Any extraneous chat was instantly shushed. &quot;You can make the rehearsal room as safe and supportive an experience as possible,&quot; said Gould, &quot;but ultimately they will have to step on to the stage, and that is what you really prepare for.\u00a0In a way it&apos;s a bit of an unknown quantity as to how it will go, but I do trust this group. While I think some people will be absolutely terrified,\u00a0and pushed far out of their comfort zone, I\u00a0don&apos;t think that we will\u00a0end up with anyone screaming on the stage.&quot; The test of that came with the full dress rehearsal before a packed house. There was clearly raised tension as I\u00a0walked with the ensemble through the\u00a0darkened wings, listening to the hubbub of the audience just a few feet away on the other side of the curtain. They lined up, as they had so many times before in rehearsal, but this time it was for real. As the lights went down, they walked forward to fill the stage \u2013 from front of house it looks as if the crowd stretches back forever \u2013 and the show began. From my vantage point, it all seemed to go as planned. The swaying and circling looked good, they parted on cue, and, most importantly, entered and exited on time and in character. &quot;I came here as a child because my uncle was a tailor in the wardrobe department,&quot; said Braithwaite at the interval. &quot;So I\u00a0can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve now performed on the stage of the Royal Opera House. It was fantastic. And far too much was going on for me to be nervous.&quot; &quot;It was very humbling to be in front of so many people,&quot; said Michael B. &quot;Because of the life I have lived I have been in some very tense situations, and I wasn&apos;t actually nervous. It was a feeling of excitement and maybe that&apos;s why I have taken to this.&quot; When the project ends, Covent Garden will ask the participants if there\u00a0are areas of theatrical work that interest them. Some work experience opportunities have been ringfenced. Streetwise and Synergy theatre hope the experience will create new possibilities for the participants in all aspects of their lives. They already have their first success story. Last weekend, Michael B was at Rada for a final audition. &quot;I signed up for the Royal Opera project because I thought it would give me experience of how a theatre actually works,&quot; he explains. &quot;But I never dreamed it would work out like this. My audition went well. A\u00a0year ago, I was in prison and had never acted in my life. In September, I\u00a0will start to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.&quot; \u2022 Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites is at the Royal Opera House, London WC2, until 11 June.", "sentences": ["Carsen&apos;s production, seen all over the world since its Amsterdam premiere in 1997, dispenses with scenery and instead fills the stage with a seething mass of humanity \u2013 the populace, the revolutionary mob."], "title": "Simon Rattle leads a revolution at the Royal Opera House", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/30/simon-rattle-revolution-royal-opera-house-dialogues-des-carmelites-poulenc", "tags": ["Classical music", "Simon Rattle", "Royal Opera House", "Opera", "Culture", "Music"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-30T07:10:29Z", "article": "The National Gallery of Victoria has removed from display an artwork linked to Dutch master Vincent Van Gogh after agreeing its Jewish owner sold the work under Nazi duress, the first successful Nazi restitution claim on a painting in an Australian public collection. Head of a Man \u2013 which was believed to have been a Van Gogh until a 2007 authenticity test proved otherwise \u2013 was last year the subject of an ownership claim by the heirs of a Jewish factory owner, Richard Semmel. The heirs, two elderly South African sisters, claimed the painting\u2019s sale at an Amsterdam auction in 1933 was a \u201cforced sale\u201d and that the work could be reclaimed under international agreements on Nazi-confiscated art.

Before the lights go down, it&apos;s easy to be flippant about an opera that ends with 16 nuns getting their heads chopped off. When the lights finally go up again, after the amplified swishes of the guillotine have silenced the nuns one by one, a good production leaves the audience, too, with a lump in the throat. Robert Carsen&apos;s staging, first seen in Amsterdam in 1997 but only now brought to the Royal Opera, is such a production. If the evening as a whole still seems long, Carsen is not to blame; some of Poulenc&apos;s scenes linger beyond their usefulness to the story, which is based on an account of a real event during the French Terror. The set, designed by Michael Levine, is a vast grey box in which Carsen arranges the action sparsely, stylishly and at times stunningly. The execution scene is beautifully handled.     Deborah Polaski as Madame de Croissy, 'a magnetic presence', and Sally Matthews, 'a good fit' as Blanche. Photograph: Donald Cooper    Carsen uses the crowd to create an undercurrent of menace \u2013 and thanks to the involvement of the Royal Opera&apos;s new community ensemble, that crowd is enormous. Jean Kalman&apos;s lighting plays a major role, sometimes throwing up telling effects \u2013 the shadow of a single footman picked out to loom above the crowd in the first scene, or the way in which Blanche appears to turn into a ghost before her disapproving father&apos;s eyes. But the old Prioress&apos;s death throes are too much in chiaroscuro for this scene to be as harrowing as it can be. Or perhaps it is that Deborah Polaski sings the role a bit too beautifully, when it needs a bit of screech. Still, she is a magnetic presence as the fierce old woman whose god deserts her at the last.     'Beautifully handled' \u2026 the execution scene at the opera's close. Photograph: Donald Cooper    Sally Matthews is a good fit in the central role, using her ripe soprano to create a Blanche who hides her puzzlement with the world behind a certain haughtiness. Anna Prohaska makes a shining debut as Constance, and Sophie Koch, Emma Bell, Alan Oke and Thomas Allen round out a strong principal cast. Yann Beuron, sounding indisposed, here wisely handed over after the interval to his understudy Luis Gomes, who brought a ringing tenor to the Chevalier&apos;s brief scene. Simon Rattle is conducting the work for the first time, and the orchestra is the only element that is slightly underwhelming; Poulenc&apos;s wide-eyed harmonies sound beautiful, but the instruments are not always ideally blended, and the orchestra seems still to be trying on the style rather than inhabiting it. But, allied to this staging and this cast, it&apos;s enough. \u2022 In rep until June 11. Box office: 020-7304 4000.

The islands, off the coast of Sumatra, are being stripped off their forests and marine wealth and dug up for tin, used widely in the electronics and IT industry by major brands making mobile phones, tablets, laptops, computers and other gadgets. Friends of Earth Netherlands, an environmental group fighting for sustainable sourcing of tin, said they are targeting Microsoft for &quot;refusing to take steps to end irresponsible mining practices on Bangka and Belitung islands.&quot; Asus, HTC and Huawei are other brands named by the group using tin sourced unethically. &quot;Big brands such as Apple, Philips and LG openly support projects to produce tin in a better way. It is unacceptable that other brands still refuse to follow this lead and take responsibility. They have been made aware Bangka-Belitung islands are being destroyed and miners are dying every week. All brands use tin from Bangka-Belitung since a third of global tin production comes from these Indonesian islands,&quot; said FoE campaigner Evert Hassink. The group has launched an online petition against Microsoft. &quot;We ask people to support our petition. In the Netherlands we will be collecting signatures on the streets and at festivals. We will take direct action against Microsoft,&quot; Hassink said. On Thursday, FoE targeted Microsoft&apos;s Amsterdam office, confronting employees over the difference between their working conditions and those of tin miners in Indonesia. Microsoft, however, said it&apos;s committed to responsible production of its hardware and packaging, including the raw materials used in making them. Brian Tobey, corporate vice president for manufacturing, supply chain and information services at Microsoft, said in a statement to the Guardian: &quot;We have reecently formalised our values and approach to responsible sourcing through Microsoft&apos;s responsible sourcing of raw materials policy, to extend our positive influence to the furthest reaches of our upstream supply chain.&quot; Tobey said Microsoft is in touch with FoE to share the approach. &quot;On 2 June we will publish a Conflict Minerals report which will disclose the number of tin smelters and refineries in our upstream supply chain, including those in Indonesia. The report will include maps showing the locations of all confirmed mines and smelters or refiners identified in our raw materials supply chain.&quot; Nokia, which is now part of Microsoft, is already a signatory to the Tin Working Group, a public-private partnership that includes campaign groups like FoE, Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, businesses and Indonesian government, working together to improve the sustainability of tin production in Indonesia.     A thin strip of pristine forest sits precariously close to area dug up for tin on Bangka island, Indonesia. Photograph: Marten van Dijl    Bangka has population of over a million and tin mining is a major source of revenue. According to government figures 44,202 metric tons of tin was mined in 2012. The revenue tin mining generates in Bangka-Belitung province is estimated to be over \u00a342m. But regulation is weak and many mines are illegal and in some cases even employing children. A Guardian and FoE investigation in 2012 highlighted how unregulated tin mining was devastating the environment and killing an estimated 150 miners every year. The investigation also revealed child labour was being used to extract tin from the island which was sourced by major brands. In 2013 Samsung admited its phones may contain tin mined by children and launched its own investigation into how its supply chain was procuring tin for the company&apos;s products. FoE&apos;s previous campaign, Make It Better, called for Europe-wide legislation that would require companies to report on their products&apos; full human and social impacts \u2013 from accidents and pollution to how much water, land and raw materials they use. &quot;Bangka has more or less turned into one big mining pit. Off shore tin mining is also rampant. Suction ships and bucket dredgers are killing marine life and destroying coral reefs,&quot; Hassink said. The Indoneisan government had passed a bill to move people away from mining to agriculture, but it hasn&apos;t had much success on the island. Environmental photographer Marten van Dijl who has extensively documented tin mining on Bangka said locals have no alternative. &quot;A lot of the people I spoke to said they would much rather do different work, because they realise they are destroying their island, and the work is dangerous. They see no alternative though, because prices of export products like rubber and pepper have plummeted. People can no longer earn the same amount of money for a day&apos;s work as compared to mining,&quot; Van Dijl said. About 80% of the island&apos;s population depends on mining, he said. &quot;All small scale fishermen have turned to mining.

"article": "This article is part of the Guardian&apos;s World Cup 2014 Experts&apos; Network, a co-operation between 32 of the best media organisations from the countries who have qualified for the finals in Brazil. theguardian.com is running previews from four countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 12 June. Jasper Cillessen Nicknamed &quot;the JC of Groesbeek&quot; (JC is Johan Cruyff in Dutch football-language), after the town he grew up in. His parents follow him everywhere and join flew to the either side of the world as him as was chosen as a third goalkeeper for a trip to South-America three years ago. When the national anthem was played Ton and Nellie Cillessen had tears in their eyes and were shaking all over, although their son was sitting on the bench and had little chance of coming on. When Cillessen drives from his house to Ajax&apos;s training centre, which takes him about seven minutes, he calls his mum. After the training he calls her again and tells her what happened. She collects all his pictures and when there wasn&apos;t one from the trip with the Oranje to Asia a year ago she took a picture from the TV and hung it up. Jasper hails them for their involvement: &quot;If they hadn&apos;t been so supportive, I would never have come this far.&quot; Jeremain Lens The Dynamo Kiev striker&apos;s uncle is Sigi Lens, a former professional footballer who was one of the 11 survivors of the tragic plane crash in Surinam in 1989 that killed 176 people, among them a group of Dutch football players of Surinamese descent who weretravelling for a friendly match. Sigi Lens couldn&apos;t play football again after the disaster because of hip problems caused by his injuries and became a well-known players&apos; agent (among them Patrick Kluivert, Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Winston Bogarde and Michael Reiziger). He doesn&apos;t want to manage his nephew, however, because he says he wants to keep his business and private lives separate. Jeremain is a lover of motorcycles and was reprimanded once for driving without a licence. Daley Blind The father of this rising Ajax player is Danny Blind, the former Ajax captain who won the Champions League in 1995. Blind Snr is now the right hand man of Van Gaal and will probably be the new coach in 2016 after the tenure of Guus Hiddink, who will take over from Van Gaal after this World Cup. In the big Ajax civil war three years ago, Blind chose the side of Van Gaal who battled with the Amsterdam club&apos;s icon Johan Cruyff for control of the club. Van Gaal and Blind had to make way, and Daley, a lifelong Ajax player who was tempted by Thierry Henry to move to Arsenal when he was 16, was asked by some fans to leave as well. Now he is a much respected member of the first-team squad. Memphis Depay Don&apos;t call him Depay, call him Memphis. He has Memphis on his shirt, and it is his rap- and his footballname. &apos;Depay&apos; is the surname of his father who left him and his mother when he was four. They had to survive by themselves, having hardly any money. Memphis loves football and rap. His former manager, Fred Rutten, demanded he made a choice and, luckily for PSV Eindhoven and the Dutch national team, he chose football. These days, Memphis is always the last one to leave the trainingpitch. He has tattoos everywhere (even on his lip), is extremely fit and is fiercely determind, saying that his ambition is to become as good as Arjen Robben, Cristiano Ronaldo and Eden Hazard as soon as possible. Ronald Koeman says he walks around as if he has won 10 European Cups and Kenneth Perez has called hima &quot;lunatic&quot;. Memphis response to that? &quot;They don&apos;t know me.&quot; He likes Louis van Gaal because &quot;he is always on my back, chasing me. And I need that&apos;. His best friend is a fluffy chow chow called Simba. Leroy Fer When the Norwich City midfielder left the club that raised him, Feyenoord, for FC Twente in the summer of 2011 he got a mourning card from a &apos;fan&apos; of Feyenoord. Later on the big midfielder thought he was going to Everton but the deal was made public too soon by a friend of the chairman of FC Twente. Ultimately it was called off, officially for medical reasons. The player nicknamed &apos;bouncer&apos; once bought a horse for his girlfriend, but realised shortly after that they couldn&apos;t keep it in their apartment, so sold it again immediately. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar The Schalke striker likes to spend his holidays with his two brothers in the forests of Scandinavia, trying to survive like Bear Grylls. When the Oranje visited Australia for a friendly match, Huntelaar was the only one who climbed the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which took more than three hours. He reads heavy Dutch literature and has his own foundation that challenges amateur clubs to take care of nature. His father Dirk-Jan \u2013 his driver and also the driving force behind the foundation - once fooled a Dutch television crew who were looking for the famous player&apos;s family, confirming to them that he &quot;knew Klaas-Jan and his parents that lived nearby&quot; and also that Klaas-Jan &quot;came round to play with his kids often&quot;.

As of yesterday morning, an online petition calling on the Belgian government to protect the country&apos;s racing pigeons from being doped with performance-enchancing cocaine was 200 shy of its target of 45,000 signatures. That nefarious pigeon fanciers have apparently been using the drug as their doping agent of choice is a reminder that a nation often pilloried for being boring is also partial to South America&apos;s most notorious export. According to last month&apos;s Global Drug Survey, Belgians are the most enthusiastic consumers of cocaine in the world, giving the drug a rating of 5.5/10 compared with just 2.2/10 from Australians, who rated it the least highly. And last week a scientific analysis of wastewater samples in 45 European cities, conducted between 2011 and 2013 and weighted against the size of their respective populations, concluded that the Belgian port city of Antwerp \u2013 not London, as widely reported in the British press \u2013 is Europe&apos;s cocaine capital. The hipster district of Antwerp Zuid, a well-heeled place where bars and galleries give way to vintage shops and furniture stores, knocked Amsterdam into second place when it came to the amount of benzoylecgonine \u2013 the metabolised compound cocaine forms after it has been in the human body \u2013 washing through its sewerage system. Zurich was third and London fourth. And yet a visitor to the city, home to Rubens and famed for its diamond trade, would find it hard to reconcile genteel Antwerp with its position at the top of the cocaine charts. Dominated by cycling lanes and tramways, it is a city of green spaces and elegant buildings. Lavender plants fill its traffic islands; people wait for the green man to appear before crossing the road; the police stop traffic so that hundreds of cyclists towing children in small buggies can stage a public protest. Even Antwerp&apos;s famed red-light district, reputedly home to one of the biggest brothels in Europe, draws as many curious middle-aged tourists as stag parties. No wonder many are reluctant to confront Antwerp&apos;s edgy reputation. Several Belgian politicians approached for comment declined to discuss the matter. Even those familiar with Antwerp&apos;s drug scene were shocked by the claims made for its cocaine usage. &quot;There just aren&apos;t more people here doing cocaine than, say, in Brussels or Rotterdam,&quot; said Joep Oomen, who runs a cannabis social club that represents some 300 adults legally allowed to grow the drug to meet their personal needs. Nevertheless, he concedes that cocaine is more popular now than when he came to Antwerp 22 years ago. &quot;It&apos;s cheap here, too. When I was 20, cocaine was for people in Hollywood. Not any more.&quot; According to the Global Drug Survey, Belgium is the cheapest country in western Europe to buy cocaine. Local people say that dealers on De Coninckplein, a small, cafe-lined square, close to its Chinese quarter, charge as little as \u20ac50 (\u00a340)a gram, half the European average. Received wisdom suggests Antwerp&apos;s proximity to its port, the second busiest in Europe after Rotterdam, ensures a cheap supply of coke, which in turn drives demand. But Steve Rolles of Transform, a thinktank that advocates reform of the drugs laws, said the truth was more complex: &quot;If there&apos;s a demand for a drug, then availability will follow. I mean, it&apos;s not like there&apos;s a lot of cocaine in Southampton, for example. There has to be something in the social fabric of the place that drives demand.&quot; In the case of Antwerp, a city once famous for its merchants, this something appears to be a new era of embourgeoisement. The Ferraris, Porsches and Jaguars snaking their way past Antwerp&apos;s boutique designer shops suggest it is a place on the up. &quot;Twenty years ago Antwerp was a lot more empty,&quot; said Oomen, who puts the city&apos;s renaissance down to European integration. &quot;The Flemish region is booming.&quot; A rising middle class and cocaine use appear to be inextricably linked. &quot;Cocaine is popular here, but it is a drug for professionals with money,&quot; said Katerine, a student drinking in a bar close to Antwerp Zuid&apos;s film museum. &quot;Young people will do cannabis or pills. It is the architects, journalists, lawyers and politicians who do coke.&quot; Daniel, a waiter at a nearby restaurant, suggested the city&apos;s rising affluence had seen it become a popular weekend destination for Europe&apos;s upwardly mobile, for whom cocaine was now an essential part of their tourist experience. &quot;People come in by plane, by yacht, by boat, by train. You can get here quickly in a car from Holland or France. It&apos;s a beautiful city and people want to have a good time when they&apos;re here.&quot; The city&apos;s reputation as a cocaine hotspot threatens to turn the clock back to the start of the millennium, when it attracted narco-tourists from northern France seeking to score cheap heroin. Keen to avoid history repeating itself, last year Antwerp&apos;s mayor, Bart De Wever, declared war on the illegal drugs scene, tripling the size of the city&apos;s drugs squad from 15 to 45 officers and pledging &quot;zero tolerance&quot;. He has set himself a formidable challenge. Few cities in the world are as immersed in the cocaine trade as Antwerp. Around 25% of the cocaine moving from South America into Europe passes through Belgium. And most of this comes through Antwerp&apos;s port, the &quot;supermarket of Europe&quot;, which has 140,000 employees and 160km of quayside. But only around 2% of the 8m containers passing through the port each year are screened. &quot;Screening is far from watertight,&quot; said Tom Feiling, author of The Candy Machine: How Cocaine Took Over the World. &quot;Law enforcement want us to think that they know the size and scale of cocaine coming in, but the reality is that they just don&apos;t know.&quot; The US State Department estimates that around 20 tonnes of cocaine comes through the port annually. But some studies suggest it could be 30 tonnes or higher. Certainly the cocaine cartels are becoming more ambitious. Two years ago the city&apos;s port authorities seized a record eight tonnes of cocaine with a street value of \u20ac500m, hidden in a container of bananas shipped from Ecuador. Last year it emerged that hackers, working with the cartels, had breached the IT systems controlling the movement of shipping containers in the port so that they could remove them before they were searched. &quot;It sounds like fantasy and science fiction, but it&apos;s the reality,&quot; said Calum MacLeod, who is a security expert at Lieberman Software Corporation. At one time the wholesale trafficking of cocaine through the port was performed almost exclusively by Colombian drug cartels. But, according to a recent article in the Journal of Drug Issues, gangs from Albania and the Philippines are now muscling in. They are aware that Europe will soon outstrip the United States as the main market for cocaine. All of which means that picturesque, prosperous Antwerp is unlikely to shed its relationship with cocaine any time soon.", "sentences": ["The hipster district of Antwerp Zuid, a well-heeled place where bars and galleries give way to vintage shops and furniture stores, knocked Amsterdam into second place when it came to the amount of benzoylecgonine \u2013 the metabolised compound cocaine forms after it has been in the human body \u2013 washing through its sewerage system."], "title": "Welcome to 'boring' Belgium where even the pigeons are on cocaine", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/01/antwerp-belgium-cocaine-capital-drugs-trade-pigeons", "tags": ["Belgium", "Drugs", "Drugs trade", "World news", "Cities"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-05-31T23:05:36Z", "article": "Part fact, mostly fiction, Poulenc&apos;s Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites (1956) holds up an unbroken mirror to the essence of faith. The nuns of Compi\u00e8gne, martyred in the French Revolution, face terror within and without, on the streets and in their souls. They sing of their joys and struggles in music that ranges from stark to radiant, mawkish to arresting, near plainchant to baroque extravagance with bells on, plus two harps, a piano and an excess of minor thirds. The music smells of incense even in a production as scrubbed and minimalist and generally antibacterial as Robert Carsen&apos;s, which has arrived at the Royal Opera House nearly two decades after its first outing, in Amsterdam, in 1997. Designed by Michael Levine and with 18th-century costumes by Falk Bauer, it can be dispatched rapidly here. Nicely choreographed movement, an upturned table or two and a few candles, all set in a blank black space, doesn&apos;t offer much in terms of dialogue, or even dialogues. The production has won praise elsewhere \u2013 Milan, Madrid \u2013 for being intense, though intensity is what it lacks. Removing the physical and concentrating on the metaphysical, as Carsen does, is almost acceptable if you know the opera intimately, or have remembered the voice types (mezzo, soubrette and so forth) of the past operatic heroines Poulenc had in mind when characterising his nuns: among them Verdi&apos;s Desdemona, Mozart&apos;s Zerlina, Massenet&apos;s Tha\u00efs. That is quite an ask. Otherwise, distinguishing several women in habits and veils \u2013 I will stick my neck out and say they came in all shapes and sizes \u2013 is hard when almost all Poulenc&apos;s finely graded relationships are flattened and belittled by the empty vastness of the stage. The agonised death of the old Prioress (fiercely sung by Deborah Polaski), full of dread after a life of devotion, felt less tormented than usual. Even the central character of Blanche, first timid then full of assurance, is occluded. Her friendship with the open-hearted Constance shows little of its usual touching sparkle, despite outstanding\u00a0performances from Sally Matthews and Anna Prohaska, the one ardent, the other bubbling with life. Luckily Simon Rattle, who was warmly applauded as if to encourage him in his reported plans to return to London post-Berlin, was in the pit to add musical roughage and depth, grit, dirt and anguish. From the opening bars, vital and brisk, he made it clear that this would be a taut performance, without indulgence. All Poulenc&apos;s religious choral works have a strong whiff of the theatrical \u2013 he was a devoted, if idiosyncratic Catholic. Yet this opera offers the reverse: with its settings of the Ave Maria and the Salve Regina, this is as close as many will get to liturgy in an age of reason.            In the women-dominated cast, Luis Gomes, a Jette Parker young artist deftly replacing an indisposed Yann Beuron mid-performance, Thomas Allen and Alan Oke contributed sharply etched cameos. Sophie Koch as Mother Marie and Emma Bell as Madame Lidoine led the beautifully sung ensemble of nuns. Apparently 26\u00a0actors and a &quot;community ensemble&quot; of 67 people, recruited from the Department for Work and Pensions and elsewhere, together with principals and chorus, made a grand and record-breaking total of 167 people on stage \u2013 a statistic the virtues of which I am still pondering. Rattle himself has suggested that this huge crowd is the scenery. Eloquent on all things, he almost convinces me. The final scene, in which the guillotine falls on the nuns one by one \u2013 aurally only, in keeping with Carsen&apos;s conceptual style \u2013 still held its power to shock, not least because Poulenc writes the rhythm of the falling blade, created by a sliding crescendo which cuts off abruptly, into the music itself. No mere sound effect, it is intrinsic to the score, and all the more chilling for it. The Royal Opera orchestra made perfect sense of this oddest of operas, with Rattle a powerful evangelist. The production will be broadcast live on Radio 3 next Saturday. An opera about counting sheep strikes one as decidedly normal in comparison. Harrison Birtwistle&apos;s rarely seen 1984 work Yan Tan Tethera (alas the same night as Carm\u00e9lites) was one of the array of events at the Barbican this past fortnight to celebrate the British composer&apos;s 80th birthday. This has been an all-join-in gala, with the Britten Sinfonia exploring English pastoral and Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, conducted by Oliver Knussen, revisiting the works which first established Birtwistle&apos;s career: Monody for Corpus Christi and Tragoedia, from 1959 and 1965 respectively. A stunning account of Gawain (1991) won a standing ovation for the composer, as well as for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the conductor Martyn Brabbins and an exemplary cast led by John Tomlinson, Leigh Melrose, Laura Alkin and Jennifer Johnston. The London Symphony Orchestra played Birtwistle&apos;s epic-sized Earth Dances (1986). Conducted with mesmerising authority by Daniel Harding, the LSO was on fire. I could not take my ears off the orchestra. In this busiest of seasons, I caught only the opening event of the increasingly essential London contemporary music festival, which took place at Second Home, a former carpet warehouse in Spitalfields, attracting a large crowd. Some of Birtwistle&apos;s near contemporaries, more associated with the art world and gathered here under the title British Underground, played works by Gavin Bryars and Christopher Hobbs among others. That untiring guru of all that is experimental, the pianist John Tilbury, was there to contribute insight and wisdom, as well as to perform one of John White&apos;s 172 sonatas. In Bryars&apos;s 1, 2, 1-2-3-4, each musician plays along to different recorded sounds in his or her headphones but no one, audience included, hears the whole. The effect is a kind of enigmatic, sleepy blues in which phrases bump into one another like a slow-mo game of bagatelle.

First, there&apos;s no proof that the boys were smoking dope. Audio footage of them saying: &quot;Joint lit. Happy days!&quot; and speculating that a passing policeman could &quot;smell an illegal substance&quot; might just mean they were messing around and role-playing while smoking an ordinary cigarette. Or, given that they were obviously aware of being filmed, maybe they were making a joky Spinal Tap style sequence for some future purpose; I would love that to be the case. But even if they were smoking marijuana, I don&apos;t think that qualifies as &quot;drug shame&quot;. Dope is far too respectable these days. Consider the list of people who have discussed their own use of it: Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, George Soros, Michael Bloomberg, Alastair Darling, Harriet Harman, David Willetts, Francis Maude\u2026 George Bush and Sarah Palin have smoked dope, for heavens&apos; sake! Norman Lamont&apos;s had space cake! (I appreciate that last line sounded like a joke. It isn&apos;t. Lamont has openly talked about gobbling space cake. One wonders how Vic Reeves or Viz could really continue after that.) The moral is: nothing that happened in that car is any barrier to Zayn Malik becoming chancellor of the exchequer. And frankly, given the state of the economy, he might as well give it a go. Cannabis seems so popular among MPs that the headline DRUG SHAME OF SQUEAKY-CLEAN BOY BAND may actually have been intended to imply the embarrassment of One Direction (a cool bunch of youngsters with 19m Twitter followers) being caught doing something so ineffably square. Given that it appeared in the Daily Mail I suppose it probably wasn&apos;t, but you&apos;d have to try a lot harder if you wanted to find a link between Francis Maude and Sid Vicious. I was quite charmed by the possibility that today&apos;s young pop stars might smoke pot, what with their Vans, Snapchats, Instagrams and 8s instead of letters. Beneath it all, the spirit of Woody Guthrie lives on! Certainly, the whiff of weed does not prevent One Direction from being &quot;squeaky-clean&quot; or, indeed, downright nerdy. Yes: I&apos;m thinking about my own years of DRUG SHAME. Feel free to scan the following list of my marijuana memories, and judge for yourself how rock&apos;n&apos;roll it is \u2026 1987 I am keen to kiss a boy. No boy in particular; anyone will do. Everyone at school is &quot;getting off with people&quot; and I feel like a weirdo because I never have. I go to a party and smoke a joint to get my courage up. A boy asks if I&apos;d like to go for a walk. Suddenly gripped by paranoia, certain that an attempted rape is on the cards, I run to an upstairs bedroom, lock the door and do not come out until morning. 1988 I am determined to be accepted by the cool crowd at school. This is a challenge, as I am fat, good at maths and have a column in the Daily Telegraph. But I relish a challenge. I acquire &quot;a quarter of black&quot;, take it to a party and pretend to be a drug dealer. I smoke copious amounts to demonstrate my expertise. Soon, I find I am hallucinating. I remember that, as a birthday present for my father, I have sponsored an animal at London Zoo: a pelican. I start wondering if the pelican will one day discover it&apos;s adopted and turn against me. I become terrified. I lie on the floor screaming: &quot;The beak! The beak!&quot; This is not as cool as I&apos;d hoped to be. For years afterwards, whenever I tell this story, I claim I had dropped acid. The truth is just too lame. 1991 I am at the Edinburgh Fringe, performing in a comedy show. It&apos;s an eye-opening month. These people have the decadence of ancient Rome, if not the noses. One night, a fellow fringe performer invites me to help make &quot;hash brownies&quot;. We improvise the recipe and it comes out as a liquid that we eat with a spoon, like soup. I become hysterical with laughter, although a few of his jokes soon put a stop to that. I snooze for a while and wake up to discover he&apos;s put on a porn film. The plot involves a robot trying to control the world by means of sex. Despite this, my host is aroused. I immediately vomit and leave. Sometimes I wonder if the poor man has ever been aroused since. 2001 I am in Amsterdam with my friend Charlie (not a euphemism). We go to a coffee shop and smoke fully legal spliffs. Then we go absolutely crazy, by which I mean: we play cribbage for seven hours. 2004 I&apos;ve been in Amsterdam again, this time for the Master Classics of Poker. Walking through customs at Waterloo International, I notice a little group of spaniels on the forecourt. How sweet, I think. Suddenly, all five spaniels hurl themselves against my suitcase. The policemen on the other end of the spaniels ask me to accompany them into a side room. In my suitcase, they discover two cannabis joints forgotten in a pocket. The policemen confiscate the joints and tell me to go home. I say: &quot;Are you going to keep those for your Christmas party?&quot;, and one of the policemen says: &quot;Probably.&quot; 2014 I read that two members of One Direction have been seen sharing a roll-up that may or may not have contained marijuana and I think: the nation&apos;s youth are probably still safe in their hands. victoriacoren.com", "sentences": ["2001 I am in Amsterdam with my friend Charlie (not a euphemism).", "2004 I&apos;ve been in Amsterdam again, this time for the Master Classics of Poker."], "title": "One Direction have nothing on my experiments with pot | Victoria Coren Mitchell", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/01/one-direction-experiment-cannabis-pot-video-drug-shame", "tags": ["Drugs", "One Direction", "Music", "Society"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-01T10:52:07Z", "article": "\u25a0 Royal Academy Summer ExhibitionBefore Wimbledon, before Glastonbury, before Ascot, the Royal Academy announces the start of summer with its annual open exhibition, the biggest of its kind in the world, with more than 1,000 works on display.

The footage, obtained by the Sun, shows the 20-year-old asking his friends: &quot;Why are black people afraid of chainsaws?&quot; He then mimics the noise of a chainsaw by saying &quot;Run \u2026 nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger&quot;, after the voice of one of his friends is heard appealing to him not to say the racial slur. The Canadian singer&apos;s camp have known about the video, shot when he was younger, for some time and have tried to prevent its release, according to the newspaper. It is the latest and perhaps most damaging controversy to engulf the superstar beloved of teenage girls. He apologised in April after posting a photograph that showed him standing in front of the contentious Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo. China and South Korea regard Yasukuni, which honours leaders executed for war crimes among 2.5 million Japanese war dead, as a potent symbol of Japanese militarism. The singer removed the image but only after it had been tweeted to his 51.1 million followers and attracted 660,000 likes on Instagram. Bieber later said he had been unaware of the shrine&apos;s controversial role. In January, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, together with the singer Khalil, on suspicion of driving under the influence, driving with an expired licence and resisting arrest without violence. Police said that Bieber told authorities he had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana and taken prescription drugs. In the same month, Bieber surrendered to Toronto police, who charged him with assaulting a limousine driver in the city last December. He attracted widespread ridicule in April last year when, during a visit to the Anne Frank museum in Amsterdam, he wrote: &quot;Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl.

Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys. First, the former Slits guitarist announces that she thinks anyone who writes an autobiography is &quot;either a twat or broke&quot; (&quot;I&apos;m a bit of both&quot;), then she launches into a passage about\u00a0how she&apos;s never masturbated \u2013 &quot;can&apos;t be bothered&quot; \u2013 but did once fantasise about being raped by a pack of wild dogs. &quot;Well, I can&apos;t stand these autobiographies that start with, you know: &apos;I was born in Acton and I went to such and such a school,&apos; they just bore me,&quot; she shrugs. &quot;And I thought, well, I&apos;m just going on my punk principles here, a bit like a three-minute, short, sharp song, the first track on an album: you should just put it out there, show them how far it&apos;s going to go, grab hold of people and say: &apos;Right, you&apos;re in for a\u00a0hell of a ride now.&apos;&quot; There&apos;s another reason, she says. Her daughter is 15, so she has been exposed to a lot of teen fiction: you have to seize young readers with the opening paragraph or they lose interest, and it&apos;s teenage girls that she really wants to read it, rather than middle-aged rock fans looking for tales from the London punk scene that spawned the Slits. &quot;I\u00a0want them to see how often you have to fail to be anything in life. I\u00a0think young men and boys are taught to fail. It&apos;s nothing to them; they do sport, they fall over, they shout: &apos;I&apos;m all right,&apos; and carry on. But with girls they&apos;re so appallingly embarrassed to fail, it&apos;s like it&apos;s considered unfeminine.&quot; She smiles, rather sweetly. In person, Albertine, now 59, seems a\u00a0very unlikely candidate indeed for authorship of a book that opens by clobbering the reader over the head with a load of stuff about wanking. She&apos;s softly spoken and appears to be aghast at how frank her book turned out to be: &quot;I&apos;ve exposed myself terribly and I\u00a0don&apos;t know what the consequences are going to be,&quot; she says. &quot;Will I\u00a0ever meet another guy now that I&apos;ve written it? How&apos;s it going to affect my daughter? Have I\u00a0gone too far? I always go too far.&quot; Neither is it easy to square the woman sitting opposite me in an east London cupcake shop with membership of an all-girl band once considered such a threat to the fabric of society that even the hotels who allowed other punk groups to stay refused to let them in. &quot;The A&amp;R men, the bouncers, the sound mixers, no one took us seriously. On top of the fact that we were all women, we had a 15-year-old singer who was absolutely nuts, running around. So, no, we got no respect anywhere we went. People just didn&apos;t want us around.&quot; Nevertheless, Albertine was a prime candidate for punk. She grew up on a north London council estate. Her father was a bully who vanished when she was 11. Her mother emerges from the book rather better, if possessed of an attitude to parenting that you might charitably describe as a little laissez-faire. At one point, she cheerfully waves her daughter, then 15, off on holiday to Amsterdam with a friend, despite the fact that Albertine has only five pounds in her pocket and doesn&apos;t know where Amsterdam is in:; she stays in a squat with a heroin addict from whom she contracts crabs.     The Slits' Viv Albertine at Alexandra Palace, London, 1980. Photograph: David Corio/Redferns    She was obsessed with music but had no idea how to get involved until she saw the Sex Pistols. &quot;It really was like the [dolly zoom] bit in the Hitchcock film where the lens comes in and they track backwards at the same time. It wasn&apos;t the band, it was John [Lydon], who was so not out there to entertain you, showing his credentials. If you came from a north London council flat, you hid it onstage, but he was what he was.&quot; After an abortive attempt to form a\u00a0band called Flowers of Romance with Sid Vicious, she joined the Slits, a\u00a0perfect flowering of punk&apos;s DIY ethos. By the time of their astonishing 1978 Peel session, they had developed a bizarre, angular, idiosyncratic style that used the fact that they had no idea how you were supposed to write songs or play instruments as fuel for music unlike anything else; the writer Greil Marcus later suggested they had &quot;rewritten the history of rock and roll&quot;. &quot;Well, we knew what we didn&apos;t want, so that&apos;s a good place to start from. We couldn&apos;t jam, so when we sort of composed, if you can call it that, we&apos;d honestly think: &apos;Does this next note go with the note before? Does it excite you? Does it unsettle you?&apos; It was unpicking all your habits, lyrically and in our music. So, although we didn&apos;t know what we were doing, if any band had done what we were doing, they wouldn&apos;t have known what they were doing.&quot; They also attracted an astonishing level of violence. Every old punk likes to tell war stories about how dangerous it was to walk the streets dressed like that, but Albertine&apos;s are genuinely shocking: the Slits&apos; 15-year-old singer, Ari Up, was stabbed on the street twice by strangers in the space of a year. &quot;People didn&apos;t know whether to fuck us or kill us, because we looked like we&apos;d come out of a porn magazine.&quot; Albertine was a devotee of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood&apos;s fetish-influenced clothing \u2013 &quot;But something wasn&apos;t quite right, with the bovver boots and the black makeup and the hair and the gobbing. We put them off kilter. We looked like aliens to them, so a guy seeing us in the street and being pissed off by us, they didn&apos;t think they would have to treat us like girls.&quot; If it were merely a punk memoir, Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys would still be a great read, packed with incident and striking pen portraits of the scene&apos;s main figures: Johnny Rotten, complaining &quot;like Kenneth Williams&quot; that Albertine is &quot;trying too hard&quot; when she attempts to fellate him; Johnny Thunders: &quot;A\u00a0very tender, thoughtful guy who the next minute couldn&apos;t wait to jab me full of heroin&quot;; Sid Vicious, who seems to have been spectacularly irritating and a kind of savant, and who manages to cultivate a ruinous hardman image while still wetting the bed. Albertine even manages to rustle up a degree of affection for Vicious&apos;s nightmare girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, a screeching pantomime villain in virtually every other punk history: &quot;Well, before they went, both of them \u2013 in a way \u2013 found some sort of bond and\u00a0companionship. It wasn&apos;t particularly healthy, but it was a bond that couldn&apos;t be broken, really.&quot; It&apos;s the second half of the book, dealing with Albertine&apos;s life after punk, that elevates it beyond most music memoirs. It opens with the curious interlude when, poleaxed by the waning of punk and the demise of the Slits, Albertine gave up music and became, of all things, an aerobics instructor. Frankly, if this happened in a novel, it would seem like a spectacularly heavy-handed metaphor for the 70s turning into the 80s but, today, Albertine has a way of talking about aerobics that somehow makes it sound like an extension of the Slits&apos; agenda: &quot;It was so exciting, girls moving their bodies. Before the early 80s, the only times girls moved their bodies was doing hockey or whatever at school, which everyone tried to get out of. This was really liberating: a sweaty room, packed with women, throwing their bodies around, sweating, looking dirty, no makeup.&quot;     The Slits in action at Electric Circus, Manchester, in 1977. Photograph: Kevin Cummins/Getty    What follows, however, is a pretty harrowing read: the book details, with candour, the &quot;seven years of absolute madness&quot; that were her attempts to get pregnant via IVF, her diagnosis with cervical cancer six weeks after the birth of her daughter and her doomed attempt to sink into a world of domesticity as a housewife who never mentioned her past. With Albertine&apos;s guitars and memorabilia from the punk era sold to fund the treatment, her daughter initially grew up unaware that her mum had been in a band. &quot;I hid myself from her in the early years,&quot; she says, &quot;because what I was, it was considered not good for a child to know. I know it sounds odd, but I&apos;d got myself caught up in a marriage and a scene that was incompatible to who I was.&quot; Of course, she says, now her daughter knows everything. &quot;I\u00a0can be completely outrageous to my daughter now and we have a right laugh.&quot; It just seems sad that Albertine wasn&apos;t proud of what she had done for so long, I say. &quot;Well, being in the Slits had no collateral in those circles. If they had known what I&apos;d done, I don&apos;t think they&apos;d have been happy about it. Now I meet people and they&apos;re interested \u2013 &apos;Oh, you were in the Slits?&apos; \u2013 and I&apos;m suspicious of it, because when I didn&apos;t mention it for 20 years, no one was interested in me. I had blank, glazed eyes. If I went to a dinner party with these middle-aged, middle-class people, the husbands, you could see them thinking: &apos;Oh God, I have to talk to another wife for an hour and a half, how boring, pass the wine.&apos;&quot; Eventually, with her marriage collapsing, Albertine made a tentative return to music. She declined to join the reformed version of the Slits convened by Ari Up a few years before her death and instead started performing at open-mic events in local pubs: She groans at the memory. &quot;I\u00a0felt like a complete fucking idiot and a lunatic.&quot; Her solo work doesn&apos;t sound much like the Slits, although, as she points out, it is, in its own way, just as confrontational. &quot;I was a middle-aged woman who was very uncool, who went and did her own thing, even though no one was doing it, there was no one to follow again.&quot; Sonic Youth&apos;s Thurston Moore offered to release her solo EP on his own label. Other musicians flocked to perform on her debut album; not just friends from the punk era but Jack Bruce from Cream and Jenny Lee Lindberg from Warpaint. &quot;That&apos;s what comes, or I hope that&apos;s what comes, of following your own true path,&quot; she says. &quot;I\u00a0hope that comes across in the book.&quot; And then something of the spirit of punk comes over her and she rolls her eyes. &quot;Hippy as that sounds,&quot; she adds.

Lampard thanked Chelsea for a hugely successful period during which he became one of the most prolific midfielders of the modern era and has held talks about a move to the US franchise New York City, a club backed financially by the Manchester City owner, Sheikh Mansour. New York City will not play their first match until March 2015, opening the prospect of him starting next season with an English club. Chelsea\u2019s all-time leading scorer with 211 goals is out of contract at the end of June and although a new deal was on offer at Stamford Bridge it was on a reduced wage. The 35-year-old, who won three Premier League titles and a Champions League with Chelsea, was not expected to feature as a first-team regular under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho next season. Lampard is in Miami with Roy Hodgson\u2019s England squad to prepare for the World Cup but met New York officials on Saturday and could be convinced to join the new Major League Soccer team, who have already signed David Villa from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Redknapp, Lampard\u2019s uncle, has been linked with the player after his QPR side secured promotion to the Premier League following a victory over Derby County in the Championship play-off final and said that his nephew was still \u201cworth his weight in gold\u201d to any team. He said at the launch of 666bet.com: \u201cI think Roy feels the same. You need good characters around whether it is England or your football club. You\u2019ve got [Steven] Gerrard, you\u2019ve got Lampard \u2013 you\u2019ve got proper guys there that the young guys can look up to. They are leaders.\u201d Redknapp believes Lampard can still perform to a high standard in the Premier League and opened the door for a potential short-term deal with QPR. When discussing the MLS season and how players in that league start the campaign in March, Redknapp added with wry humour: \u201cIs it really as long as that? I suppose he\u2019ll have to go to QPR.\u201d Lampard released a statement confirming his departure from Chelsea that read: \u201cWhen I arrived at this fantastic club 13 years ago I would never have believed that I would be fortunate enough to play so many games and enjoy sharing in so much success. This club has become part of my life and I have so many people to thank for the opportunity. \u201cFirstly, Ken Bates, who put his neck on the line to sign me as a young player and without him I would not have even begun this experience. Roman Abramovich, the man who saved our club and took us all to new levels. His desire to push the club to the top of the football world has rubbed off on everyone. \u201cThe club will move forward, and as a Chelsea man I have no doubt that with the quality of the players that are there, they will continue with the success that we have all enjoyed over the past seasons. \u201cFinally and most importantly, I would like to thank the Chelsea fans. I believe they are the greatest fans in world football. You have supported me from the moment I arrived. Not only on the pitch, but in difficult moments in my personal life off the pitch. I will never forget. \u201cI feel honoured to have shared so many special times with you. Bolton, Amsterdam, Munich, the list goes on and on. I, and we as a team, could not have achieved those moments without your support. Whatever the next challenge is for me I will always be amongst you and have Chelsea in my home and in my heart. Hopefully I will get to see you all soon to say goodbye properly.\u201d Lampard has been synonymous with Chelsea\u2019s success over the past 13 years and is regarded by Hodgson as a key, senior member of his World Cup squad with 103 caps.

It is described as &quot;a glorious and truly atmospheric surprise ... little-changed from its heyday in the late 19th century,&quot; while the Kinmel Arms pub in Conwy, Wales, is dubbed a &quot;top-notch enclave of fine food, real ale and boutique accommodation.&quot; The Dores Inn, which overlooks the less-visited eastern shore of Loch Ness, is also featured, and other British locations are Battle in Sussex and the tranquil, yet often overlooked, south Cotswolds region.

People are eating sandwiches, popping in for a chat or to read the paper. So far, so normal. But the view from the window tells a different story. The cafe overlooks a square full of boarded-up shops and homes. Graffiti covers almost every available surface, including a forlorn children&apos;s playground. In the neighbouring streets, row upon row of vacant and abandoned houses are covered in eye-poppingly colourful doodles or large murals by street artists. To add to the dystopian feel of the place, every so often a large pile of rubble shows the spot where a house once stood, and the giant smoke-billowing cooling towers of Belgium&apos;s first commercial nuclear-power station loom on one side. This is Doel, a 400-year-old village north-west of Antwerp that has been at the heart of a political battle for survival for over two decades. A state-funded corporation is seeking to raze it to make way for the land-hungry port of Antwerp. But members of the ever-dwindling local populace are fighting to keep their homes and the village alive. They say a second container dock isn&apos;t necessary since the previous one, which opened in 2005, is being used to less than a fifth of its capacity (the corporation disputes this figure). What&apos;s more, they argue, the riverside village has lush nature, culture and heritage in abundance \u2013 plus the first stone-mill in Belgium and a listed early 17th-century house that belonged to Peter Paul Rubens&apos;s family.     A street sign reminding visitors to Doel to respect the residents    From a population of around 1,300 in the early 70s, there are now only 25 inhabitants left. But they are a brave and well-organised bunch. A 52-year-old named Marina Apers is their unlikely champion. She lives in a house emblazoned with banners announcing that she and her husband will &quot;leave Doel over our dead bodies&quot;. &quot;Every time the government succeed in something, we start legal procedures against them \u2013 and mostly, we win,&quot; she says. So far, the EU&apos;s strict environmental laws have been on the villagers&apos; side: Doel is, among other things, home to one of Europe&apos;s largest swallow colonies. Apers moved here in 1991 after being employed as a cleaner at the nuclear power station. She and her husband, Guido, were assured that buying there was a safe bet, but after they renovated their home, rumours started to surface that Doel &quot;was going to have to disappear&quot;. The decline hasn&apos;t happened overnight, though the majority of inhabitants left just before 2000 when they were offered cash premiums to sell up voluntarily. &quot;They threatened that if people didn&apos;t do that they would be expropriated,&quot; she says, &quot;and if you are expropriated, you get very little money.&quot;     A mural on an abandoned house by the Belgian street artist ROA    By 2007 there were 350 people left and squatters had started to move in, making some of the deserted houses habitable again. That year, Apers helped set up the campaigning group Doel 2020. One of the ways it planned to ensure the long-term survival of Doel was to turn it into a haven for artists. &quot;In the beginning it was good. The idea was that it would become an open-air museum,&quot; she says. World-renowned artists such as Luc Tuymans and Michelangelo Pistoletto took part. Soon the village attracted street artists from across Belgium and abroad who left their mark. &quot;In the early days the murals related to the message the residents had, which was &apos;don&apos;t take our village away&apos;,&quot; says the Brussels-based photojournalist Virginia Mayo, who has been visiting Doel since 1998. &quot;But later, other artists came and just used all the buildings as wall canvases for their work, probably because there was little police presence.&quot; Of all the street art adorning Doel&apos;s abandoned walls, it is the internationally famous Belgian muralist ROA&apos;s haunting oversized rat, crow, headless boar and upside-down rabbit that have become the village&apos;s most memorable. But other well-known street artists from Belgium, Holland and France have also left a trail of weird and wonderful cartoon-like figures \u2013 a moody mural of Barack Obama as the Joker by Amsterdam&apos;s Ives.One and some robot aliens by the Brussels-based artist Resto are notable examples.     A creation by Psoman    It&apos;s a surreal place, strewn with hundreds of abandoned buildings, including schools, petrol stations and a now-silent town hall, and the constant hum of high-voltage power lines intensifies the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Some houses still have furniture and toys lying around in rooms and gardens. As Mayo writes in her book of photos of the village: &quot;Doel feels like Chernobyl without the accident.&quot; Against its will the place has become a tourist attraction, with thousands of urban-decay enthusiasts, photographers and tourists visiting every year. Some don&apos;t even get out of their cars, choosing instead to drive down the empty streets, windows open, camera phones aloft. The waitress at the cafe says her customers are chiefly employees from the nuclear plant and the hordes of tourists. &quot;People come here because it&apos;s so bizarre,&quot; she says. A few buildings have remained free of graffiti, including the 11 homes still in private hands, the church, the cemetery and the house once belonging to Rubens&apos;s family, which the corporation has promised will be dismantled and rebuilt brick by brick in a neighbouring town.     Work by an unknown artist in Doel    Signs stating that Doel is inhabited are intended to encourage good behaviour, but as Mayo says, &quot;respect for the town has diminished and for some it has became just derelict rather than a curiosity&quot;. Vandalism and looting is commonplace, agrees Apers, as are illegal raves in the village&apos;s dilapidated barns, despite stepped-up police patrols and neighbourhood watch schemes. &quot;Last night I got to sleep at 2am because I could hear people racing down the streets in their cars,&quot; she says. Another of Doel&apos;s remaining inhabitants, the larger-than-life 80-year-old Emilienne Driesen, has lived in the village all her life and is now the only resident on her road. She keeps her home in excellent condition yet, poignantly, has had to put a sign in her window reminding passersby that dit huis is bewoond (&quot;this house is inhabited&quot;). At night she takes sleeping and anti-anxiety pills to block out the noise of vandals, but is adamant she will never leave. The Doel 2020 activists and remaining inhabitants are acutely aware that this widespread destruction and deterioration only strengthens the port&apos;s case. &quot;They have done it on purpose,&quot; says Apers, who refers to it as &apos;demolition politics&apos;. &quot;There are over 400 families who would like to come and live here because they work nearby.&quot; But the corporation argues that Doel is unsafe and uninhabitable. How much longer Apers and her fellow campaigners can hold out is unclear, but their fighting spirit remains. Whether the town survives or not, it is unlikely the murals will. They stand as transient artefacts in a town whose fate is utterly in limbo. \u2022 Travel was provided by Visit Flanders. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 June.

Photographs of the boogie-woogie-loving neo-plasticist often show him bow-tied, angular and suave amid the rectangles that climbed the walls of his studio. The divisions and flat colours that filled his paintings seemed to migrate to every surface and multiply, rectangle upon rectangle, line upon line, proliferating in his studio mirrors and reflecting in the windows. Even the floor was divided by an arrangement of plain-coloured rugs. Among it all were his paintings, displayed on easels and walls, their own squares, rectangles and lozenges colliding with the shapes around them. Some were hung above head-height, up towards the ceiling. A life-sized reconstruction of one of Mondrian&apos;s studios has been erected at Tate Liverpool. It is hard to imagine anyone working in such a space without tripping up on all those damned rectangles, never mind the coal scuttle, the cast-iron stove and all the little tables and cabinets. Mondrian&apos;s studio was a place of edges and planes. He recreated this setup in his many studio moves, in Amsterdam and Paris, in London and in New York, where he escaped the Blitz. His phonograph blared out on 59th Street, playing Pine Top Smith, Andy Kirk and his Clouds of Joy, Woody Herman. Earlier, he had been a fan of the Charleston. Everything in Mondrian was syncopated.     Mondrian's Composition With Grid 8: Checkerboard Composition With Dark Colours, 1919. Photograph: Gemeentemuseum Den Haag    None of the reconstructed studio&apos;s contents are actually Mondrian&apos;s: neither the paintings nor the coal scuttle, the pipe in its ashtray, the clean, square-edged brushes and the opera glasses. What did he need these little binoculars for in his cramped quarters? Maybe he looked through the wrong end, to see his paintings as if from afar. This is not so farfetched as it might seem. The reconstruction, first made for a 1995 exhibition at the Pompidou, gives us a vivid idea of Mondrian&apos;s ideas about space and form. It is a surprise, perhaps, that Mondrian \u2013 like Barnett Newman \u2013 saw the studio as sanctuary as well as workshop. There he entertained other artists and potential collectors, and had himself photographed for newspapers and magazines. Sometimes, we glimpse him in a housecoat, pretending to paint for the camera. His studio became a kind of theatre, a stage set where he could act out being Mondrian, for himself and for his public.     Mondrian's Composition in Colour B, 1917. Photograph: Tate Liverpool    It was all of a piece with his paintings. How Mondrian organised his studio and adjacent living spaces demonstrated the way he wanted his art to go beyond painting and into the modern word. He related his work to more than architecture, the horizontals and the verticals of the city&apos;s grid, seeing it as universal. &quot;And man?&quot; he said. &quot;He must be nothing in himself, just part of the whole. He thus no longer feels his individuality, he will be happy in the earthly paradise he has created.&quot; Tate Liverpool&apos;s Mondrian and His Studios follows the artist from studio to studio during the mature phase of his career, from 1914 until his death in 1944. There is a touching moment when we come across the passenger list of the ship that in 1940 carried him to New York. Pier Head, where he stepped on board, is visible through a nearby window. It echoes the fact Mondrian&apos;s art, for all its flatness, is filled with distances, proximities and reversals. One of his greatest series, Pier and Ocean, has always seemed to be about exactly this.     Mondrian in his studio in Paris, 1933. Photograph: Tate Liverpool    Mondrian and Colour, a second exhibition at Turner Contemporary in Margate, traces the longer arc of his development: from its beginnings at the exhausted end of the Dutch landscape tradition through to the austere, beautiful and pared-down Lozenge Composition With Four Yellow Lines from 1933 \u2013 by way of his belated impressionist paintings, his symbolist phase and his flirtation with theosophy. While many visitors at Margate lose themselves among the moonlit windmills and backlit oaks and elms of his earlier work, I am transfixed by the deceptive simplicity of the Lozenge Composition. It still feels timeless in a way his landscapes don&apos;t. Both contained and expansive, it hangs high on the wall as Mondrian intended. There&apos;s nothing to it but yellow and white, four yellow bars of slightly uneven width and optical weight that disturb what otherwise would be an absolute symmetry.     Mondrian's Lozenge Composition with Four Yellow Lines, 1933. Photograph: Collection Gemeentemuseum Den Haag    It is in his later works that the hand-craftedness of Mondrian&apos;s paintings really counts. There&apos;s no avoiding the traces of his touch. The Dutchman was never purely mechanical. Though the exhibition is called Mondrian and Colour, it never goes into its actual complexities. Neither his whites nor his blacks are all the same. Did he mix his primaries or were they direct from the tube? Mondrian was as acutely aware of the effects of sheen, from matt to gloss, and the thickness and weight of the paint, as he was of colour and tonal values. Up close, his art isn&apos;t nearly as clear and clean as it looks in reproduction. The pure white paint has cracked. The brush makes its slow negotiations, edge against edge, plane against plane. One unfinished painting in Liverpool has rough charcoal lines drawn among the painted bars, showing us how intuitive his working procedure really was. He found unity and division as much by sight and feel as by ruler and premeditation. All of this somehow humanises Mondrian&apos;s art, and more importantly slows us down when we look.     Mondrian's Arum Lily, 1909-10. Photograph: Gemeentemuseum den Haag \u00a9 2014 Mondrian/Holtzman Trust c/o HCR International    Taken together, the two exhibitions make for a patchy and incomplete retrospective of an artist whose work aspired to be universal. Mondrian has now become a brand as much as an aesthetic. Having a chain of American hotels named after him and his rectangles and lines decorating Yves Saint Laurent dresses and Kleenex boxes probably isn&apos;t quite what he had in mind. I prefer to imagine Mondrian dancing among his squares and rectangles in his studio, lost in the music and the world of his own creation.", "sentences": ["He recreated this setup in his many studio moves, in Amsterdam and Paris, in London and in New York, where he escaped the Blitz."], "title": "Piet Mondrian review \u2013 studio soirees and all that jazz", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/04/piet-mondrian-painting-studio-tate-liverpool-turner-contemporary-colour", "tags": ["Culture", "Painting", "Piet Mondrian", "Art and design", "Art"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-05T13:36:47Z", "article": "Oh, to be a teenager in love, suffering from stage four cancer! Adapted from John Green\u2019s bestselling YA novel, about love-struck cancer teens \u2014 a piece of doomed-love romanticism served up with bright-eyed, almost evangelical zeal \u2014 The Fault in Our Stars is dubious in the extreme, and morally and ethically objectionable from just about every angle. It elevates cancer sufferers to the same exalted state of higher being to which tuberculosis sufferers were once hoisted by Keats and Byron, or vampires by Kristen Stewart fans. It\u2019s Twilight on chemo. It\u2019s a few inches shy of launching a fully-fledged romantic death cult. It\u2019s the swoony, drop-dead hit of the summer. You\u2019ll love it. The cast list divides neatly in two: those with cancer and those poor souls without it. In the plus column is Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a 17-year-old high school kid with bangs she tucks behind her ears, and a small cylinder she carries around everywhere, supplying oxygen to her lungs through a tube into her nose. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d asks her mom one morning. \u201cYou mean besides the terminal cancer?\u201d replies Hazel, who, having survived a brush with the disease at age 13, has long since availed herself of the degree-zero humor of its survivors. She calls herself \u201cthe Keith Richards of cancer kids\u201d, which makes it sound like the ultimate high school clique, second only to emo kids, goths, or Bieber haters.  The movie is up to its armpits in the weird, inverted glamour of the sick. Nudged by her mother, Hazel attends a support group, headed by a bearded Jesus freak, filled with fellow cancer kids, and in her spare time reads books like The Imperial Affliction by cult Dutch author Peter Van Houten. \u201cWhat&apos;s it about?\u201d asks a handsome kid named Augustus (Ansel Elgort) with sleepy blue eyes whom she meets in group. Three guesses. \u201cCancer,\u201d replies Hazel, quickly adding, \u201cbut really it\u2019s the best book about dying written by someone who gets it but who isn\u2019t themselves dying.\u201d Augustus gets it. Having lost a foot to the disease, he now trails unlit cigarette from lip, as away of daring fate to interrupt his determination to live an \u201cextraordinary life\u201d. He wears the mysterious, unalterable smirk of someone famous and adored in another universe, who is just waiting for this one to catch up. Elgort played Woodley\u2019s brother in Divergent, but here seems much more personally and professionally fulfilled to be playing an out-and-out dreamboat: a self-confessed virgin, Gus texts when he should, boasts killer abs and gets up immediately from his video game when Hazel enters the room \u2014 by common agreement, the modern definition of gallantry. Hazel can\u2019t take her eyes off him, as if incredulous at his all-round gloriousness, and he agrees to be drunk in, in a spirit of magnanimity as much as anything else. The film works on only one level, but so completely on that level that the rest doesn\u2019t seem to matter: Woodley and Elgort have terrific chemistry. There will doubtless be cynics who fail to take Gus at his own estimation \u2013 \u201cI&apos;m really kind of an awesome guy\u201d\u2013 on the grounds that he isn&apos;t really any kind of guy at all, more a gleaming, golden incarnation of the filmmakers\u2019 desire to pave every step of Hazel\u2019s way (and by extension that of her audience) with fluttering wish fulfilment.            Point taken. \u201cThe world is not a wish-granting factory,\u201d says Gus, unlike the movie, which is a wish-granting machine. It\u2019s all soft touches, like being covered in kisses. I\u2019ve never heard so many sounds of &quot;aw!&quot; from an audience. Tracking down Van Houten via email, Gus elicits an invitation to visit and lays on an all-expenses paid trip to Amsterdam, where he takes Hazel to a champagne dinner, declares his love for her and, the next day, takes her to see her hero. Van Houten turns our to be not only scowling and drunk, but played by Willem Dafoe, which is a bit like coming across Max Schrek grinning at you, fangs and all, at the centre of a bunch of roses. Dafoe gives a snarling little speech on infinity, fictionality and the limits of adult pity \u2014the only serious misstep of the film, popping its mood with a burst of vinegar. They end up in Anne Frank\u2019s house, of all places, where Hazel pants up the stairs with her oxygen cylinder to the sound of tour-guide narration (\u201cWhere there is hope there is life\u201d), reaches the top, kisses Gus and receive a round of applause for her labors. You won&apos;t know where to put yourself. The whole episode feels almost drunk, it&apos;s so bad, but then it seems to be the curse of these YA adaptations, that the very in-built audience that guarantees a studio green light also seems to guarantee a timorous fidelity to every comma.  Otherwise, screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H Weber \u2014 who wrote 500 Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now \u2014 do a good job of hewing to just enough realism, and intelligence, as is needed to allow the fantasy to slip down. \u201cOK, lungs, keep your shit together,\u201d Hazel tells herself, before embarking on that Amsterdam date. And \u201cI fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once,\u201d is simply a great movie line, whichever way you cut it. This is probably the role that will seal it for Woodley, who, since first drawing praise in Alexander Payne&apos;s The Descendants, has proven a shy performer \u2013 helpless in the face of a direct compliment, those eyes wide like a deer, her lines readings always diminishing in volume, as if she\u2019s fading right in front of you. She spent much of Divergent looking as if she wanted the ground to open up beneath her feet and swallow her. That\u2019s perfect, of course, for Hazel \u2013who is fading out for good \u2013 although she throws in a little J-Law sass for good measure. The film begins and ends with a close-up of those big brown eyes and, really, on some level, there\u2019s nobody in it but her. The whole thing is an extremely sophisticated version of that solipsistic teenage fantasy where you imagine yourself dead so you can hear what is said at your own funeral. Here we get two eulogies, read while their subjects are still alive, during which I heard something I\u2019ve never heard from an audience: first a collective snuffle, with maybe the odd honk, as people wept openly into their drinks, followed by laughter, as we all heard ourselves and realised our own foolishness for falling for such crud. Make no mistake: the film is crud, but the higher kind of crud that leaves you feeling OK with yourself in the morning. It opens the valves and cleans the pipes. I went in sure I would hate it and emerged, two hours later, pale-faced and tear-stained, marveling at the scale and speed of my wipeout. \u201cThere was a lot of crying in that theater,\u201d I heard one young man report into his cell phone, in the hushed tone you might reserve for a massacre. \u201cMan, that was ugly.\u201d  The Fault in Our Stars is out in the US on 6 June and in the UK on 20 June", "sentences": ["Tracking down Van Houten via email, Gus elicits an invitation to visit and lays on an all-expenses paid trip to Amsterdam, where he takes Hazel to a champagne dinner, declares his love for her and, the next day, takes her to see her hero.", "\u201cOK, lungs, keep your shit together,\u201d Hazel tells herself, before embarking on that Amsterdam date."], "title": "The Fault in Our Stars: 'The swoony, drop-dead hit of the summer' \u2013\u00a0first-look review | Tom Shone", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/05/the-fault-in-our-stars-first-look-review", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Teenage", "John Green"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-05T15:23:04Z", "article": "&quot;I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1943,&quot; says Larry Clark in the introduction to Tulsa, his now iconic photobook from 1971. &quot;When I was 16, I started shooting amphetamine. I shot with my friends every day for three years and then left town, but I&apos;ve gone back through the years. Once the needle goes in, it never comes out.&quot; Tulsa remains Clark&apos;s most visceral book, an insider&apos;s view of a period in the mid-1960s when he was a teenager living what he calls, without irony, &quot;the outlaw life&quot; \u2013 shooting up speed, having sex with his strung-out girlfriends and hanging out with his gun-toting junkie friends. Sex, drugs and violence were captured in a raw, grainy monochrome that defined the raw confessional style adopted later by Nan Goldin, Corinne Day and Antoine D&apos;Agata. But Clark went there first, and Tulsa remains a template for all that followed, a blurring of the lines between voyeurism and intimate reportage, between honesty and exploitation. Writing about Tulsa in The Photobook Volume 1, authors Martin Parr and Gerry Badger say that the &quot;incessant focus on the sleazy aspect of the lives portrayed, to the exclusion of almost anything else \u2013 whether photographed from the &apos;inside&apos; or not \u2013 raises concerns about exploitation and drawing the viewer into a prurient, voyeuristic relationship with the work.&quot; Yet it is that very dynamic that imbues the images with such disturbing power. Next week, Foam in Amsterdam pairs images from Tulsa with photographs from Clark&apos;s follow-up, Teenage Lust, for a show that reminds us just how unsettling Clark&apos;s early vision of the teenage &quot;outlaw life&quot; was, and remains. Clark&apos;s long-lost film, Tulsa, which was shot in 16mm in 1968 and rediscovered in 2010, will also be screened \u2013 an altogether more experimental precursor to the movies that followed, including Kids and Ken Park, and full of graphic sex.     Dead 1970. Photograph: Larry Clark. Courtesy the artist and Luhring Augustine, New York    The film, like the photographs is, as Clark once told me, &quot;a record of his secret teenage life.&quot; When he first saw the prints, he was as shocked and scared as everyone else. &quot;I remember thinking, &apos;I have either got to burn all the negatives and shoot myself, or go down to LA and try and get it published.&apos;&quot; But the subsequent publication of the book and his reputation as a groundbreaker did nothing to appease his demons. Because of his subsequent heroin addiction, it took Clark 10 years to complete Teenage Lust, which was finally published in 1983. An autobiography of his teenage years, it comprised more raw images of drug use and adolescent sex, as well as portraits of young hustlers working Times Square in New York, with a little of the edginess leavened by family snapshots and portraits. (Intriguingly, his mother was a studio photographer who specialised in mother-and-baby portraits.) It is a more thoughtful book, but it also prefigures Clark&apos;s seeming obsession with the wayward lives of teenagers, which has since become the central theme of his films, most controversially Kids, and later books like 2008&apos;s Los Angeles Vol 1, in which he trails a bunch of skater kids from Compton, east Los Angeles. Here, the early black-and-white v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style is replaced by a lingering, brightly-hued gaze that sometimes looks like a street-fashion shoot. It seems a long way from Tulsa. There was no judgment, no moral point of view in his early work: these kids all look like they&apos;re simply having a good time, as they shoot up or point guns at one another. But they still disturb viewers today because of that \u2013 and because they depict suburban America; this wasn&apos;t a blighted inner-city picture, but the kids next door.     Speedy & Barb, New York City, 1968. Photograph: Larry Clark. Courtesy the artist and Luhring Augustine, New York    One of Clark&apos;s images, of a young girl grinning as she gleefully squirts liquid from a syringe, has never left me. He was more instinctively sure of himself when he was young and actually living what he was photographing, even as his doggedly self-destructive life spiralled out of control. Tulsa, for all its voyeuristic charge, was made in extreme circumstances by a driven young man whose life lurched from one drama to the next: intravenous amphetamine use at 16, a brief spell in art school in New York at 18, a two-year stint in the US army in Vietnam, and a return to Tulsa at 20, where he lived with a prostitute and graduated to heroin. When I pushed him on why he was so self-destructive, Clark fell uncharacteristically silent, then mentioned his abiding feeling of being ignored and unloved by his father as a child. A classic Freudian drama, then, played out in extremis by a lost boy who, for a long time, was intent on self-obliteration. And yet he survived, like Nan Goldin after him, by picking up a camera and shooting the chaos of his crazy life \u2013 even as he wanted to do anything but that. &quot;When someone I knew would die, which happened a lot, I&apos;d think they were one of the lucky ones,&quot; he told me. &quot;I honestly used to think I was cursed to stay on earth and make photographs.&quot;", "sentences": ["Next week, Foam in Amsterdam pairs images from Tulsa with photographs from Clark&apos;s follow-up, Teenage Lust, for a show that reminds us just how unsettling Clark&apos;s early vision of the teenage &quot;outlaw life&quot; was, and remains."], "title": "Larry Clark's photographs: 'Once the needle goes in, it never comes out'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/05/larry-clark-tulsa-teenage-lust-photography-controversy", "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Larry Clark", "Film", "Drugs", "Society", "Exhibitions"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-06T09:53:23Z", "article": "There is, between you and us continental Europeans, a disagreement which is turning ugly.

You never shared the true meaning of the project which Winston Churchill, speaking on your behalf, set out in Zurich in 1946 with his incredible words: &quot;We must build a kind of United States of Europe \u2026 Great Britain, the British Commonwealth of Nations, mighty America \u2013 and, I trust, Soviet Russia \u2026 must be the friends and sponsors of the new Europe and must champion its right to live.&quot; Were you not listening? These were the thoughts of a giant, shared by another giant, Charles de Gaulle. You wanted trade, and you thought about nothing else. With President de Gaulle gone, you were able to join. But from this point you never, ever allowed even the smallest step towards greater integration, or even the smallest expansion of genuinely joint decisions. The European community did trade, which suited you, because it defined itself as an economic community, but for those things that should be at the very heart of an economy \u2013 taxation, dispute settlement law, social policy \u2013 you demanded and imposed the continuation of unanimous decision-making. You wanted paralysis. So many neighbouring countries applauded and envied our achievements and wanted to join. You supported each enlargement; we did too, even though we knew it would dilute the community. But you never allowed the slightest deepening of the union. Europe remained bogged down and badly run, an economic giant, a political dwarf. Eventually the size and success of the European community meant that it made little sense for it to be involved only in the economic aspects of our shared lives. Diplomacy, defence, justice were all raised. You succeeded in limiting joint political actions to a few narrowly defined circumstances and instances. Thanks to you, the Maastricht treaty was a failure and only narrowly voted through. You did not have to do much to ensure that the Amsterdam and Nice treaties and the constitutional convention would also be flops because they changed little. Paralysis was guaranteed, because you had already got what you wanted. But you had to make things worse. When you didn&apos;t like the agreed rules, you tore them up by seeking derogations, &quot;I want my money back&quot; agreements such as the British budget rebate, and eventually the right to opt out of policies altogether when they did not suit you. But your demands became even more outrageous. Amid the paralysis and growing anger the continental desire grew for stronger and more powerful leaders. The nationalities of the Belgian Jean-Luc Dehaene and the Luxembourger Jean-Claude Juncker could not have bothered you, it was enough that they were federalist in outlook, had strong voices and would not be easily pushed around. Two vetoes in 10 years, that takes some nerve. You dared to do it. Europe is dying from it. The most recent elections have confirmed this. Even the euro, the only policy that you could not block, yet whose rules you were involved in writing, and which therefore bear your influence, remains weak and suffers from the lack of oversight that you were able to make sure would prevail across the EU. I know, you are not completely alone in this. The refusal to recognise a common European interest, always putting the national interest first \u2013 you reintroduced these ideas and made them contagious. Nobody is perfect. Acknowledge at least that you deserve the prize. Out of this disaster and ahead of the European elections, the tenacious among us managed to inject more democracy into the rules. So it was agreed that the majority in the European parliament would choose the European commission presidency. It hardly changes the essence, but it is a start, a way to begin restoring public interest and engagement. Personally, I voted for Martin Schulz as it would trouble me to see somebody with a monetarist outlook at the head of the commission. But the people have spoken. It may be relative, but there is a majority and its leader is Jean-Claude Juncker, a bold and courageous federalist. Democracy demands that he become the president of the European commission. But you want to prevent this. You want to break the process by which a more democratic Europe could emerge. You are stopping Europe finding the democratic force and legitimacy that it needs. A leader picked in these circumstances will be weakened. But this is what you want. Without internal democracy Europe is unworthy, and is in the process of dying. And you are sending us back to that Europe, you despise us so much. What right do you have? And beware, this contempt will backfire on you. You will eventually be right. Now you pretend to want to exit; the majority of your people are in no doubt about it. But you have a banking interest in remaining to capitalise on the disorder that you have helped to create. So go before you wreck everything. There was a time when being British was synonymous with elegance. Let us rebuild Europe. Regain your elegance and you will regain our esteem.

But it could take two months before the Arctic Sunrise leaves Murmansk harbour, according to the campaigning group. The ship was boarded by the Russian coast guard and towed 500 miles from the Pechora Sea to the northern Russian port of Murmansk in September 2013. Thirty activists, including six Britons, were arrested and accused of hooliganism and piracy. Although the 30 activists were all released from prison after three months of international protests, the ship remained in port pending a decision by the Russian investigative committee (IC). According to Greenpeace International lawyers, the committee unexpectedly \u201cannulled the arrest\u201d of the ship on Friday and informed the Amsterdam-based group that the ship could leave. However, Greenpeace International said it was unlikely that the Arctic Sunrise would be seaworthy for at least a month and possibly more.  \u201cOur main priority now is to get the ship checked by independent surveyors to assess the level of damage since it was seized by Russian agents on 19 September. We will also be asking the Russian authorities to continue guarding the vessel until our crew arrives to take custody of it,\u201d said Daniel Simons, Greenpeace International legal counsel. Essential navigation gear is also known to have been removed from the ship and is being held separately by the Russian authorities. \u201cIt will take at least a month to prepare the ship,\u201d said Maria Favorskaya, a Greenpeace spokeswoman in Moscow. \u201cMillions of people spoke out against the illegal imprisonment of the Arctic 30, and today the final member of the group is free to come home. Our ship was confiscated during an entirely peaceful protest against Arctic drilling in international waters. There was absolutely no justification either for boarding the ship or keeping it for eight months. \u201cThis whole affair was a brazen attempt to intimidate those who believe that drilling for oil in the melting Arctic is reckless and unsafe.

As the movie starts to hit the big screens all over the world, what are you most worried and excited about? What might be done well or (sharp intake of breath) even better than the book? Or will it be a cheese-filled flop? We asked mega fans of the book, all members of the Guardian children&apos;s books site, to share their dreams and nightmares as this much treasured novel is turned into a film\u2026 OrliTheBookwormI trust John Green. I trust him to break my heart, to make me laugh and to leave me wanting more. Therefore if John Green says the movie adaptation of TFIOS is good (as he has repeatedly done), I trust him with that too. For that reason, I&apos;m more worried about humiliating myself by the wailing tears I know will be running down my cheeks the whole way through, than if I&apos;ll like the movie or not \u2013 of course, I&apos;m terrified it will ruin the book for me and millions of others, but the book is such a classic, I don&apos;t think anyone or anything could possibly ruin it. Plus, it has Ansel Elgort in it, so it can&apos;t go too wrong. Hopefully. Okay? Okay. Becca.EI am very excited to see it. I am glad to have seen John Green involved in the production of it and also the cast looks very promising. I hope that the film isn&apos;t over dramatised and made out to be even more upsetting that the book \u2013 I struggled enough with the book! The soundtrack is really good \u2013 not much to judge a book by but gives you an idea of the feel of it. The trailer got me very excited. I&apos;m trying not to get too excited about it so it&apos;s not a let down but I&apos;m dying to see it. I have high hopes for it.  Matilda WormwoodI hope the film doesn&apos;t stray from the book too far\u2026 I want to have my heart broken, and my heart can only be broken in certain ways\u2026 KhadijaH10After hearing that The Fault in Our Stars was becoming a film, I became secretly very excited. I generally pride myself on reading classical literature, and nonfiction, not what I previously regarded as a &quot;romcom&quot; book. However, upon reading it, I realized that John Green&apos;s masterpiece is far more than a teenage love story. It&apos;s funny, it&apos;s frank, and it&apos;s heart wrenching. I hope that the film adaptation really captures Green&apos;s brilliant work, and shows how it&apos;s different from the generic romance novel. I am worried, though, that the movie might fall into the sappy love story rut, which is so much less than the novel. I don&apos;t want a happily ever after ending, I want something that makes me leave the cinema in tears, that gives me a whole new perspective on teenage love and tragedy. I want to laugh, too, even if it is through tears. I have high hopes for this film, that it will convey the unique voice of John Green that so many teens have fallen in love with. NicI am feeling surprisingly positive about the forthcoming film adaptation of The Fault in Our Stars. In the videos that John Green posts on Vlogbrothers John always seems so genuinely pleased with the film that I can&apos;t help but believe that it will turn out okay; I trust him and his influence I guess.  KatSI think the beauty of the book was in the characters, because they&apos;re so much more than their cancer, they&apos;re like real people we know. So what I&apos;m worried about for the film is that the writing and the actors won&apos;t live up to the characters in the book, that the focus on the plot will detract from creating the personalities of the characters we fell in love with the books. And if we don&apos;t love the characters, then the ending won&apos;t be anywhere near as heartbreaking. However I know that John Green was very involved in the production of the film, so I have hope that he will have helped make the film just as good as the book. StarryKnight22My expectations are that the film is going to be an emotional roller coaster! I think that the intricate elements of the story will be portrayed extremely well and I hope that some of the metaphors are not overlooked. But all in all I can&apos;t wait, even if it means taking a whole box of tissues! Jessica38Where do I begin I am the biggest TFIOS fan ever!!!! I think that overall the film will be amazing but I think that they might make Gus&apos; death a bit more exaggerated than it is in the book. Also they have got the wrong colour hair for Isaac which is annoying me but anyway. I am really happy with the people they have chosen to play Hazel and Gus because I think they will work really well together. Love it soooooo much!!!:)))))) ;( Gunny&apos;s-girlI&apos;m sceptic. Films are almost always a disappointment. I&apos;m sure there are a few examples but they&apos;re rare. I was massively disappointed by the film adaptation of The Hunger Games, although admittedly Catching Fire was much better. I&apos;m not sure a film about books has quite the same impact as a book about books.            TheBookThiefI&apos;m going to try and explain to you why I&apos;m scared for the movie adaptation of the phenomena which is the novel The Fault in Our Stars. Well, to start off with \u2013 as Marshall McLuhan once said- &quot;the medium is the message&quot;. As a book, there&apos;s no denying the brilliance of The Fault in Our Stars\u2026 but as movie? How is the heartbreak, the intensity, the excruciating pain going to translate onto the big screen? Will it be able to? I&apos;m worried that the beauty of TFIOS lay purely in how John Green wrote it, that the delicacy and poignant messages were due to his style, not due to the content of the book. Without his writing, the plot which could have been mistaken for any young adult book \u2013 but the lines which are quoted all over the internet are due to the way Green painted pictures of Hazel and Gus, due to his inimitable tone. WHAT IF THE MOVIE RUINS IT?!?!When you adapt something from the screen, the fans always insist as much of the plot and original writing is retained as possible \u2013 it makes the movie seem authentic. Green knows this, and he spent a large amount of time on set when TFIOS was being filmed. I believe, along with many others, that his input and advice, along with the acting of Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort are going to make this movie an incredible experience for his fans. And yet, who knows how it will be for those who haven&apos;t read the book? I adore TFIOS but it&apos;s a painful love because I need the movie to be perfect and not ruin anything. ManathebookaholicIt&apos;s an amazing book and I hope that the movie inspires people just as the book did. I&apos;ve recently seen the metaphor clip from the film and it was just as I imagined it! Also, I&apos;m glad that the quotes from the book are being used, it just gives the film the whole book-to-screen feeling. In conclusion I&apos;m definitely looking forward to watching the film especially since Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort are acting in it! NogginI am hoping that the film will portray the characters in the right way, that the actors&apos; personalities don&apos;t mess everything up! I think that the film may not be as subtle as the book either. However, I am still looking forward to it! Tashtastic12I think that the characters will be done well. I think they&apos;ll have good chemistry and will be very believable. I hope some of the scenes don&apos;t go cheesy as they&apos;re quite romantic, but I doubt they would \u2013 I think they&apos;d be executed well. Overall I think the movie will be done incredibly well and that it will be a perfect companion to the book. AyeshaWhen the trailer for the movie came out, I could barely hold back my excitement because it was exactly like how the book had described it. I had heard of Shailene Woodley before and had watched the new movie Divergent (also one of my favourite books) which stars Woodley as the main character. I just loved her acting skills and I love that she was chosen to play Hazel in The Fault In Our Stars movie. Ansel Elgort is also in Divergent and he is also exactly like how Augustus is described in the book. His witty personality and flirtatious behaviour towards Hazel that is shown in the trailer begins to really bring the book alive, which is one if the main reason why I&apos;m so excited to watch the movie. I wonder if the movie will also make me cry as much as the book did. I have never actually been this excited to watch a movie before and I am really looking forward to it.  EmybotTFIOS was my favourite book of 2013 and John Green is my favourite author of all time so I&apos;m both very excited and very nervous for the film. I&apos;m also not quite sure how I feel about sobbing in the middle of the cinema. The film has brought lots of new fans to the &quot;nerdfighter&quot; community and I&apos;m first and foremost very proud and pleased that John has had this opportunity and I really enjoyed being with him through every step of the process, I hope that the film is faithful to the book but I&apos;m slightly worried about how the quotes will translate from being said in my head to being said on the big screen and I&apos;m hoping they don&apos;t end up sounding like a cheesy pile of glump. The messages from the book really need to be heard and I hope that more people become aware that illness is not the defining character of a person. I&apos;m super, super excited to see it although will probably have to bring an entire store of tissues *eeek* DFTBA. LaurenI&apos;m feeling really excited about the film, but also a bit like I don&apos;t want to build my hopes up, as the book had such a special feeling as you read it, I don&apos;t know if they&apos;ll be able to capture it in a film. Safah TFIOS TFIOS, where do I begin? This book is easily one of my favourite novels of all time, the writing, characters and plot were flawless. The dialogue was witty and the meanings in every line, page and chapter? I still find myself opening to a random page and discovering a new hidden message between the lines. Which is why the film adaptation is so exciting and yet absolutely terrifying. While the idea of reliving such a beautiful story in motion picture is thrilling, the fear that it will all go wrong is awful. The trailers and excerpt clips look amazing though, and I can already feel all the emotions! I think my only fear is that the story might focus too much on the romance of Hazel Grace rather than the journey that romance led to. Still, I&apos;m sure it will be amazing and I can&apos;t wait! InfernalpanemallegianceAlthough I&apos;m more than sure the movie adaptation will be extremely heartbreaking, as I&apos;ve heard from people who have been to Little Infinities screenings, I&apos;m also hoping it will be an accurate adaptation. In my opinion, Shailene and Ansel are really great actors and I&apos;m really looking forward to seeing them in TFIOS. If John Green is pleased with the film, I&apos;m sure I would be as well! As with all book to movie adaptations, I fear that some scenes will be missed out. But overall I&apos;m expecting this movie to be amazing! ShazzSharinganI cannot wait to see the movie adaptation! I&apos;ve been following any updates on the movie very closely and so I know that John Green himself plays a huge role in the bringing the movie to life, so I have very high expectations. Given that the author himself has said that the film is true to the book, I think we can assume that the movie is very well done. From the trailers, I can tell that Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley have really good chemistry together and so I have firm faith that they&apos;ll work wonders on screen. At first when the actor of Augustus was announced, I realized that he did not have blue eyes as described in the book. This may seem like a minor thing, but to me who had a picture of him already visualized in my head, I felt a little disappointed. There were so many connotations to do with his eyes in the books, I felt like some of the magic was being taken away. However, since John Green chose the cast, I decided to put my firm faith in his decision and now after watching the trailers and sneak peaks, I can definitely say I was not disappointed! Ansel Elgort might not have the physical appearance completely down, however, the little quirks that make Augustus such a lovable character (like his smirks) is what makes him shine. So far, the movie seems just as magical as I imagined inside my head. I am a little worried however, that some of my favourite scenes will not be included in the movie due to the lack of time. But this is something every fangirl and fanboy have to deal with when their favourite books get turned into movie (*cough*Harry Potter*cough*). No matter how hard you try, you cannot possibly include every detail from the book and so even if some parts have been cut out, I&apos;ll still be pleased as long as the movie manages to capture the main message of the book. The only thing making me even a little reluctant to watch the movie are the waterworks that are surely to erupt afterwards. But hopefully, everyone around me will be crying just as much and so we&apos;ll be happily sharing a box of tissues. CaraEricaThe Fault in our Stars is a literary masterpiece and how can the film adaptation compete? Well, for me, the voice of Hazel was the true winner in this enchanting story. Her voice is warm, witty and tragically truthful, as she shares with us her life, her love and the fault, not in ourselves, but in our stars. With the upcoming film adaptation I&apos;m worried that the voice of Hazel may be lost and with this her unique perspective on the world. However, Shailene Woodley who is to play Hazel Grace is a fantastic actress, who I&apos;m sure she will keep Hazel&apos;s emotions raw. Despite this, I still have doubts that the narration within the film will not live up to Green&apos;s words. How can they possibly fit all the content of the book into 125 minutes? I&apos;m afraid of what they may cut out and what they&apos;ll miss by doing so. What if they miss out dinner with the Waters, what if they miss out the Amsterdam kiss in the Anne Frank museum, what if\u2026 There are so many scenes key to the story that could be the difference between a mediocre film and a masterpiece. Another of my fears for the film adaptation is that the characters will be a disappointment. Will Peter Van Houten be quite so annoying and can Gus possibly be as adorable? Part of me wants to fall in love with Ansel Elgort&apos;s portrayal of Gus, yet my other half argues he can&apos;t possibly be the same as the one I imagined. Nevertheless, The Fault in our Stars film is sure to be a tearjerker and, although I am not convinced it can live up to the book, I hope they can prove my doubts wrong and more\u2026 JoelAs a book reader it&apos;s always easy to say the book is better than the film, and that&apos;s because we all have different imaginations and we create characters in our own heads \u2013 and a director, who as an individual has his own imagination, can never quite rival our own thoughts and expression. There are intense moments, sad moments and funny moments which in our minds are delivered in our own peculiar and particular way. So while I want the director to have the exact delivery and expression of every line in the book that I imagined in my head, I have to accept that it&apos;s not going to happen. What I really hope for is that the director doesn&apos;t leave any important (or important to me) sections of the novel out of the film, arguing that they wouldn&apos;t transfer well to screen.  ScoutingforbooksI expect the film to be a disappointment for me and all of us TFIOUS fans because we already have our own ideas of what the film is going to be like and that is why I feel were all going to be critical of the film. Bu I don&apos;t think the film in itself is going to be that bad. I feel its going to be like the Perks of Being a Wallflower, quirky and indie, a good watch but not the most amazing film. The trailer was actually amazing, though this has been the case with many bad movies. I&apos;m not so sure of the casting choice of Ansel Elgort, he doesn&apos;t seem as charming and aloof as Augustus but when we all go and see the film is when we will find out the truth of the casting and how great it us. ItWasLovelyReadingYouFrom what I&apos;ve heard, the film is true to the book and if John Green is happy with the how it turned out, I&apos;m hoping I shouldn&apos;t be too worried! I&apos;m super, super excited to see how the plot pans out (slightly nervous over what will be cut), and a little dubious over the relationship between Ansel and Shailene. I&apos;ve watched the trailer and all the little clips that crop up every now and then but every time there is a romantic moment I cringe, AND THAT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. It&apos;s meant to be like the book \u2013 where my reaction is to melt into a puddle on the floor! So, yes, *slightly* scared but ultimately very very excited indeed! I&apos;ve re-re-read the book in preparation (which now I come to think of it, wasn&apos;t a very good idea as I&apos;ll notice immediately when a scene has been cut\u2026) SpruzieThe thing I&apos;m mostly hoping that the film will be able to portray is how much we love the characters - and therefore how awfully sad the ending is. I can&apos;t wait to see it though, and I am sure Shailene and Ansel will be brilliant as Hazel and Gus, they look very similar to how I pictured the characters to be. Other than that, I am praying that John Green does a Stan Lee and appears as a cameo in the background (in the crowds or something) because that would just make my day! Wow.

She was hailed as folk singer of the year at this year&apos;s BBC Folk awards, and is celebrating her 30th birthday by performing at 30 of her favourite venues around the country. As she currently has no new album to promote, she could give a relaxed reminder of her musical history. She began as a traditional singer, but is now best known for her own songs \u2013 though her compositions often echo traditional songs, or have been constructed around them then given a contemporary edge. It&apos;s a subtle and sophisticated way of reworking the folk tradition, but is just one part of her skill as a songwriter; she can also produce atmospheric or pop-orientated material, too. Backed by her own fiddle playing and her four-piece band, the Midnight Watch, which included Anna Massie of Blazin&apos; Fiddles on guitar, she began with Good Man&apos;s Wife, a song based on folk stories of ladies leaving their feather beds to run off with Gypsies.

When you&apos;re using Facebook, he told his biographer David Kirkpatrick, &quot;you have one identity\u2026 The days of you having a different image for your work friends [and] for the other people you know are probably coming to an end\u2026 Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.&quot; Orwellian as that might sound, Zuckerberg was really only expressing the emerging Silicon Valley consensus: henceforth, life would be lived entirely in public. It&apos;s long been conventional wisdom in the tech world that nobody got rich betting against Facebook. Yet since the start of this year, a cluster of new apps has spread rapidly by attempting exactly that, offering anonymous ways to share the secret stuff we&apos;d never want linked to our names: the shameful confessions, private fears, suppressed desires and malicious gossip. Their names evoke dark alleyways and lips placed close to ears: Whisper, Confide, Secret, Sneeky, Backchat, Rumr, Truth. &quot;Social networking has changed the way we socialise \u2013 we&apos;ve lost the ability to be open and vulnerable with one another, because we&apos;re always worrying about the permanent record,&quot; Chrys Bader-Wechseler told me recently. The 30-year-old sounded a little bleary: he&apos;d been up until 5am that day overseeing the worldwide rollout of Secret, the app he co-founded, which works by accessing your phone&apos;s contacts, so you know the confessions you&apos;re reading are from your friends, or friends of friends. (It went live in the US in January, and soon attracted $8.6m in venture capital.) &quot;We want to lower the bar,&quot; Bader-Wechseler said, &quot;so that friends can let themselves be vulnerable again.&quot; The day I installed Secret, someone whose number is stored on my phone wrote: &quot;Whenever I&apos;m tempted to cheat, I think about my son, and how much a broken family would hurt him.&quot; I knew the person who&apos;d written it, but I didn&apos;t know who&apos;d written it; the combination was to prove highly addictive. By inviting us to communicate anonymously \u2013 not just the trolls, or people with specific reasons to stay incognito \u2013 the new generation of apps has launched a real-world test of a puzzle that goes back to Plato. When our identities are concealed, do we automatically degenerate into amoral, foul-mouthed bullies? Or, freed from the pressure of maintaining a flawless public facade, might we discover new ways to relate to one another with compassion and honesty? Admittedly, the indications so far aren&apos;t especially promising. The most obvious applications of online anonymity are cyberbullying and abuse; YikYak, which launched late last year and claims 250,000 users, has already been blamed for at least two evacuations, one lockdown and much general chaos at American high schools. The app uses geolocation to broadcast anonymous &quot;yaks&quot; to the 500 physically closest users, effectively making it the nuclear-weapons version of a message scrawled in a toilet cubicle. (In Alabama, two teenagers were charged with making terrorist threats after announcing plans for two separate school shootings via YikYak; the company has now &quot;geo-fenced&quot; the locations of 180,000 US schools, in an effort to make it unusable.) Meanwhile, the biggest splash made so far by Whisper was a message posted a month before Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin&apos;s &quot;conscious uncoupling&quot; \u2013 naming the entertainment lawyer with whom Paltrow was allegedly conducting an affair. (Her publicist denied it.) Even Secret, where things tend to feel more grown-up, has drawn the censure of several prominent venture capitalists, not normally the kind of people to spurn money-making opportunities on ethical grounds. &quot;It&apos;s gossip. Slander. Hateful. Hurtful,&quot; wrote one of them, Mark Suster. &quot;It&apos;s everything the Valley claims to hate about LA, but seemingly are falling over themselves at cocktail parties to check five times a night.&quot; In April, technical problems brought Secret to a halt. A headline on TechCrunch.com read: &quot;Secret App Down For Hours, Silicon Valley Goes Back To Work&quot;. It&apos;s hard to deny that non-anonymous social media \u2013 Facebook, above all \u2013 have created an irksome pressure to maintain a consistent, upbeat, ultra-competent public persona at all times. As a new psychology study seems to argue every other week, Facebook contributes to the sum of human misery, by exposing us only to the highlights reel of other people&apos;s lives, making us feel dissatisfied or unworthy by comparison, and fuelling a competitive urge to portray an even sunnier facade. Or, as Montesquieu put it: &quot;If we only wanted to be happy it would be easy; but we want to be happier than other people, which is almost always difficult, since we think them happier than they are.&quot; The result is a &quot;game of one-upmanship that&apos;s never-ending,&quot; says Neetzan Zimmerman, who recently joined Whisper from Gawker. &quot;When you&apos;re on Facebook and a friend says &apos;I have a baby!&apos;, you&apos;re immediately forced to produce a baby as well, and then that baby has to do something amazing first. Your life must look basically perfect, but beneath the surface you&apos;re dealing with the emotional issues that everybody has. There&apos;s no room for that on Facebook. You\u00a0can&apos;t both have a perfect life and say: &apos;Hey, I\u00a0have a number of illnesses&apos;, or: &apos;My wife left me.&apos; Because you&apos;ve built this identity for yourself that you cannot expose to the light.&quot; There are further problems, such as the phenomenon of multiple social circles: what 13-year-old is going to speak candidly on Facebook when their parents and possibly grandparents are on it, too? Another is the way that past indiscretions are never past any more. (Might British politics have taken a different course if there&apos;d been Facebook photos of Nick Clegg setting fire to a cactus as a student in Germany in the 1980s?) &quot;Ephemeral&quot; services like Snapchat, on which shared pictures and video vanish after a few seconds, are a direct reaction to the discomfort this causes.     'On Facebook and Twitter, for all the sense of performance, there are certain constraints on our showing off: we might want to be noticed, but we also want to look accomplished, and either respectable or cool' Photograph: PA    It&apos;s overwhelmingly in Facebook&apos;s interests to have all our messages and snapshots, our purchase history and reading lists, linked to a single and genuine identity: that&apos;s the way to make a fortune from targeted advertising, and it&apos;s the reason the firm is so vigilant in deleting what it suspects are fake accounts. But it&apos;s much less clear that it&apos;s in our interests. Critics tend to talk about anonymous and ephemeral apps as if they&apos;re a radical and generally sinister development: witness the media panic over Snapchat sexting. Yet it&apos;s just as plausible to argue that it&apos;s Facebook&apos;s undiscriminating publicness that&apos;s the radical thing. Before the internet, we navigated multiple, shifting levels of privacy with barely a thought. Now that&apos;s harder than ever. But haven&apos;t there always been some things we needed to say without everybody knowing we said them? The Ring of Gyges \u2013 as any first-year philosophy student who&apos;s not too busy exchanging dirty jokes on YikYak ought to know \u2013 is a mythical invisibility device featured in Plato&apos;s Republic. Would anyone behave decently, the book&apos;s characters wonder, if nobody could see them? Glaucon, Plato&apos;s brother, is gloomy on the matter: &quot;No man would keep his hands off what was not his own, when he could safely take what he liked out of the market.&quot; Socrates has a more optimistic view: we&apos;re happier when we do the right thing, so we&apos;d soon learn to behave ethically, even when unseen. But the short history of the internet has tended to bolster Glaucon&apos;s case. &quot;Any app or tool that enhances anonymity will contribute to the general feeling of a disinhibited space where actions and behaviours don&apos;t carry consequences,&quot; argues Elias Aboujaoude, a Stanford University psychiatrist and author of the 2011 book Virtually You: The Dangerous Powers of the E-Personality. The web comic Penny Arcade summed things up more pungently in what it termed The Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory, expressed as a simple formula: &quot;Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total Fuckwad&quot;. Yet the Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory may not be quite correct. The &quot;online disinhibition effect&quot;, as it was formally named in 2004 by the psychologist John Suler, is more about online behaviour in general than anonymity specifically. Suler&apos;s work described how people become more abusive towards those they can&apos;t see, or who are physically distant from them \u2013 even when the aggressor&apos;s identity isn&apos;t hidden. Furthermore, he argues, we often approach cyberspace as a separate dimension, where the usual rules don&apos;t apply The truth is that, when people do don the cloak of anonymity on Whisper or Secret, they seem far more likely to slip into the language of the confessional, or the therapist&apos;s couch, than of the poison pen letter. The platforms are full of personal disclosures, sometimes searingly intense, more often just marginally embarrassing: My baby boy passed away recently I saw his picture today and cried. I cried because I love him and miss him. I&apos;m a guy, so no one thinks to talk to me. I still feel tempted to go the wrong way on escalators. I work in a six-figure job and hate almost all the people in my industry as soulless drones. My 13-year-old makes me cry almost every day. She talks to me like I&apos;m a piece of shit. That embarrassing moment when you mean to call\u00a0someone from the toilet but you Facetime them\u00a0instead. &quot;I do personally believe that basically people are good,&quot; says Bader-Wechseler of Secret. &quot;Having this raw, uncut stream of thought from other people forces you to self-reflect, and you have this feeling \u2013 or at least this is how it feels for me \u2013 of connection. It&apos;s a very introspective, personal experience.&quot; On the new anonymous apps, in contrast to some older services such as Ask.fm, there are no stable identities at all, even fake ones: each post is a one-off, unlinked to any others, so there&apos;s less incentive for users to try to acquire trollish reputations using pseudonyms. That said, the relative absence of malice is also down to strenuous efforts to rein it in, not least because the companies&apos; expansion, and potential future income from advertising, depend on it. Since your posts come from your phone, your number can be banned if you overstep the mark; Whisper employs more than 120 human moderators to comb its messages for abuse. Whisper tries to detect if you&apos;re entering a proper name, and will\u00a0only let you continue if it&apos;s the\u00a0name of a public figure: &quot;Brad\u00a0Pitt&quot; but not just Brad, &quot;Jennifer Lawrence&quot; but not Jennifer, who might be a colleague or classmate. (It&apos;s unclear what happens if the non-celebrity&apos;s name actually is\u00a0Jennifer Lawrence.) And there are a handful of cases in which the new apps do seem to have made the world a better place. When a student in Virginia used YikYak to reveal suicidal thoughts, says the app&apos;s 23-year-old co-founder Tyler Droll, &quot;there was a huge response from students nearby: &apos;We love you, stay safe.&apos; A group of YikYakkers went to his dorm \u2013 they went to talk to him and got him the help that they needed.&quot; (The story hasn&apos;t been officially confirmed.) Another student user, in Tennessee, summoned 1,000 people in the vicinity to have their mouths swabbed as potential blood-donor matches for a relative with a rare form of lymphoma, Droll says. It&apos;s possible to envisage the services changing the way we communicate in other fundamental ways. YikYak already permits users to &quot;peek&quot; into the conversations happening in other locations \u2013 only American universities, so far, but Droll hopes the function will let people immerse themselves, from a distance, in breaking news events. Given sufficient users in, say, Kiev, you wouldn&apos;t have to\u00a0hunt for the best Twitter or Facebook accounts to follow; you&apos;d just select a central location in the Ukrainian capital and be plunged immediately into a stream of anonymous thoughts from that vicinity. &quot;Imagine the World Cup in Brazil, or the military coup in Thailand,&quot; Droll says. &quot;Imagine being able to look into those places in real time, unbiased and unfiltered.&quot; (In oppressive regimes, the apps will undoubtedly need to give a greater guarantee of true anonymity than they currently can; most make it clear that they&apos;ll hand over user data in response to law enforcement requests, and their vulnerability to hackers is unclear.) Zimmerman, at Whisper, sees that app evolving into an unprecedented species of news source \u2013 &quot;a mountain of untold stories&quot; concerning not only alleged celebrity infidelity, but also personal accounts of hard-to-discuss topics, like sexual assault on university campuses. (The discussions beneath such postings are notable for their supportiveness and compassion.) Whisper recently announced a partnership with Buzzfeed, allowing the viral-content site to plunder its messages for articles; Whisper-based stories so far include 17 Alarming Confessions of Revenge, 13 Scandalous Wedding Confessions and 17 Confessions From British Teachers. &quot;On a school trip to Amsterdam I spent \u00a3300 on a brothel and spent the remainder of the night in a cafe,&quot; read one note in the latter collection, purportedly from a geography teacher. After hanging around on several anonymous services for a couple of weeks \u2013 mainly as a reader, occasionally as a poster, and no, I&apos;m obviously not going to reveal what I\u00a0wrote \u2013 I began to notice something strange. Nastiness\u00a0wasn&apos;t the dominant tone, but then\u00a0again neither was\u00a0heartfelt human-to-human confession, nor\u00a0the teary-eyed discussion\u00a0of taboos. On Whisper, sex was a fairly\u00a0big deal; users can contact each other through their messages, so it has naturally become a forum for setting up casual encounters.\u00a0But the truly dominant thing, everywhere, was attention-seeking: jokes, cod-philosophical pronouncements, wry observations\u00a0about people&apos;s behaviour in restaurants. On any public network, that wouldn&apos;t have been a surprise; when I try to be funny on Twitter, it&apos;s partly for the ego-massage of favourites and retweets linked to my name. Secret and Whisper have similar favouriting systems, but I&apos;d assumed they wouldn&apos;t matter\u00a0much. Who cares about receiving an\u00a0accolade when nobody will ever know you\u00a0received it? Lots of people, apparently. The new apps show\u00a0how attention has become &quot;not merely a\u00a0means to the end of furthering some content,\u00a0brand, or yourself, but\u2026 an end in and of itself,&quot; says Nathan Jurgenson, a social media theorist who also works as a researcher for Snapchat. On Facebook and Twitter, for all the sense of performance, there are certain constraints on our showing off: we might want to be noticed, but we also want to look accomplished, and either respectable or cool, and\u00a0we don&apos;t want to say things that might later\u00a0be revealed as lies. With our identities hidden, we&apos;re freed to do what we want \u2013 and\u00a0what many of us want most of all is to go\u00a0viral. &quot;These apps need to sell the fiction that\u00a0what people are posting really are secrets,&quot;\u00a0Jurgenson says. Sometimes, they might be. But they&apos;re more likely to be lurid fabrications, or, for all you know, people just being smart alecks: Today I found out that my son isn&apos;t actually gay\u2026 he just told me that so that then I&apos;d let him have girls in his bedroom. When customers don&apos;t say &quot;thank you&quot; I intentionally say &quot;you&apos;re welcome&quot;, just to throw them off. I babysit for atheists. I teach their daughter about\u00a0God. Dear person with a fuckton of items in the &quot;15 items or less&quot; lane, I hate you. Plato would have been surprised. And maybe\u00a0rather depressed. When their identities are\u00a0hidden, some people turn malicious, and others become candid or\u00a0disarmingly kind. Generally, though, even\u00a0when we&apos;re invisible, we just want to\u00a0be noticed. \u2022 This article was edited on 9 June 2014.

The picture shows the artist standing stiff as a board in front of one of his geometric abstracts. He stares irritably out of the painting (and the painting within the painting, which is composed entirely of rectangles, and which puts another round his head) in a neat collar and bowtie, one of precious few people ever to appear in his art. But it is not this, nor the clothes that surprise. The modernist-as-banker style is common from Stravinsky to TS Eliot onwards, though there is a perfect correspondence here between the tailored painter and his fastidious works. What is striking is something else: the strange attempt to fuse two kinds of art. Mondrian (1872-1944) had stopped painting nature from the life and reduced his art to the famous grids of black, white and three primary colours. But those colours are still palpable (mixed to muddy greys and browns) in the self-portrait, and the picture within the picture (and all its light-dark alternations) exactly echoes his system of grids. We are to understand that the same artist is able to make both the naturalistic man and the abstract canvas and lo, here they are \u2013 here he is. It&apos;s a sharp conceit, and yet the self-portrait is awkward, its surface heavily reworked and Mondrian appears frankly uneasy. To come across it in Margate, in the terrific Mondrian and Colour show at Turner Contemporary, is to witness something like aesthetic schizophrenia. The passionate painter of dazzling high-chrome image, or the single-minded monk of the grids \u2013 which of the two artists is he? It&apos;s an old question, but as perennial as the grass. Mondrian has been dead for 70 years but still it seems that his work divides starkly between early figuration and later abstraction, the former supposedly loved mainly by the public (especially in the Netherlands), the second revered by curators, specialists and historians. You would have thought that segregation had ended by now, but the concurrent show at Tate Liverpool, with its historic focus on Mondrian&apos;s studios from Amsterdam to Paris and New York, doesn&apos;t include a single figurative painting.     Dune Landscape, 1911, by Mondrian: 'as beautiful as any Turner sunset'. Photograph: \u00a92014 Mondrian/Holtzman Trust c/o HCR International    That this is a lamentable lack is brought home in Margate, where many landscapes never shown in this country before have arrived from the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague. Joyous, dynamic, celebratory in mood, rich in hue, these paintings come as a revelation. Azure, gold and pink, the evening clouds drift in scarves above the flat Dutch landscape. Flower fields grow vast, seas turn purple, lavender and cobalt as they stretch into the far horizon. A single coral-pink cumulus blooms in a hot blue heaven. Dune is painted on the spot, in oil on card, its pink and marigold sands at one with the rose and cerulean sky that scintillates above, a sight as beautiful as any Turner sunset on the real beach outside. The sky shivers, as if propellers were rushing through it. A fantastical red windmill rears out of glowering cobalt, monumental and yet delicate as a paper silhouette. These paintings are vividly exciting. The earliest pictures, mainly made before 1910, are all low horizons, pollarded willows and the brown barns and outhouses of early Van Gogh; and sure enough, you see Mondrian rehearsing his contemporaries. There are fauve-bright portraits, Monet waterlilies and stands of poplars, but the Dutchman flies onwards and very soon you see the grids prefigured. A tree bursts into pointillist strokes, evening sun turns ploughed furrows into glinting lines. Light breaks through dark willows in white lozenges and squares. Much has been made of the geometric compositions \u2013 trees and fences intersecting with flat walls \u2013 in these landscapes, and they are oddly more symmetrical than the abstraction to come. But what&apos;s more exhilarating is\u00a0the rising thrum of colour and the slow mounting pressure of paint. It is there in the very earliest work, as Mondrian puts the image together, blocking, pushing, compacting the paint just like the clay and loam between the old timbers of the farmhouse depicted: he is building the picture.     Mondrian's Farmhouse with Wash on the Line, circa 1897, the earliest work in the Margate show. Photograph: \u00a9 2014 Mondrian/Holtzman Trust c/o HCR International USA    The architectural analogy takes a twist in Tate Liverpool&apos;s lifesize reconstruction of his Paris studio. This is a walk-in Mondrian, white walls, black floor, blue, red and yellow rectangles glued to the walls. The table-top is red, the cigar box is blue, the dictionary is painted white (how neat, how pure, how Dutch.) The easel looks like the archetypal Mondrian structure. It&apos;s hard to image how radical this must have appeared before Mondrian became emblematic of modern design. But the meerschaum pipes, the iron-rimmed spectacles and above all the 19th-century stove that heated his cell fairly help. Still it is difficult to ignore the obsessive-compulsive ordering of objects and the nursery-school aesthetic. Mondrian and His Studios has its surprises too. It&apos;s not quite true that Mondrian only ever used primary colours in the abstracts. The first wall offers orange, lime, lavender and many shades of grey in three 1918 pictures that glow, jaunty and sonorous \u2013 a performing trio. But Mondrian never does it again. Indeed his restlessness is everywhere apparent. With his limited grid, Mondrian achieved an extraordinary range of effects. In one series, yellow is squeezed to the edges of the canvas to get an ever-higher pitch as white takes over. In another, blue squares resound like thunderclaps among leaden traceries. Two parallel lines brought close together lighten the tone. Funereal black squares halt the tempo.     Mondrian's Composition with Yellow, Blue and Red 1937.    If the grids are, as Mondrian insisted, spiritual, emotional and harmonic, one ought to be able to speak of how they make one feel. Sometimes the feeling is strong: of limitless space, high clear sound, acrobatic balance and euphoria, of buzzing cities, soft winds, relaxing lulls. But just as often glumness sets in. The paintings are wintry and depressed, heavy in their facture and discoloured with age. How old some now look compared with the scintillating seascapes. This show would be austere without its studio theme, and relies largely on stills and film of Mondrian&apos;s quarters in Paris, Amsterdam, London and finally New York in 1942 for its onward thrust. By now, the artist had been recreating the same room for 20 years no matter where he was or what was happening in the outside world. This turning inward inflects the late work and no amount of talk about Mondrian&apos;s love of Disney, jazz or ballroom dancing can detract from the sense of willed isolation. But to see both shows is to believe in Mondrian&apos;s utter commitment to his principles, derived from Goethe out of mystical theosophy, for only such discipline would insist upon the total transition from exuberant figuration to enforced abstraction (pace the compromised self-portrait). In Margate, where one sees his whole career beautifully condensed in 60 works, there is the sense of intensity turning to profundity: everything growing deeper, richer, clearer.

Brazil - Billy Bragg            Over 30 years Bragg has had 11 top-40 albums including the 1986 classic Talking With the Taxman about Poetry, and reached No1 with a cover of the Beatles\u2019 She\u2019s Leaving Home in 1988, a duet with Cara Tivey. He is celebrating 10 years of the Left Field at the Glastonbury Festival. billybragg.co.uk  Brazil have a wonderfully jaunty national anthem that climbs up and down the scales with the agility of a young Jairzinho. Dating from 1822, its florid lines were never designed to be sung by 80,000 people in a massive stadium, so it is not unusual for the crowd and the music to fall out of sync. The opening line places us beside a stream in the vicinity of S\u00e3o Paulo and the lyrics make passing reference to a death-defying chest and the bosom of freedom. And unlike our own God Save the Queen, it does mention the name of their country, surely the bare minimum requirement of a national anthem.  Croatia \u2013 Martin Fry            Martin Fry is the singer from ABC, who had a string of hits in the 1980s including Poison Arrow and The Look of Love. The Lexicon of Love, released in 1982, was named the 92nd greatest album of all time by Q magazine. abcmartinfry.com  Lyrically it\u2019s an unapologetic heads up to the glory of the beautiful homeland. You wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from a national anthem. With instructions to Drava to keep on flowing and the Danube to not lose it\u2019s vigour. A real Croat love fest. What is surprising is the tune. Nothing prepares you for the brazen ferocity of the Croatian anthem. It sounds not unlike a child with a wooden spoon and a biscuit tin followed by a stern beating. Percussion supplied by dustbin lids on boots and sledgehammers. At least it\u2019s mercifully short. It should fire up the team in Brazil. Anything less than victory and Luka Modric will be forced to listen to it repeatedly on the bus home.  Mexico \u2013 Charlie Simpson            As a member of Busted Charlie Simpson had four No1 singles and two triple-platinum albums between 2002 and 2004. He then formed the Kerrang! award-nominated rock group Fightstar. His latest solo album, Long Road Home, is released on 14 July. charliesimpsonmusic.com  My first thought was that it sounded like a war march, and when I read the lyrics it is a sort of war cry. I suppose a call to arms is a fitting thing for a sportsman to hear before they go into battle. The other thing was how complex the melodic structure was in comparison with the British and American anthems. Our anthems are like nursery rhymes; they\u2019ve gone for the equivalent of Schubert\u2019s fifth symphony. I imagine it\u2019s hard for their kids to learn at nursery. I\u2019m not a massive football fan myself, but I get into the big international competitions, as I suppose everyone does. My wedding\u2019s actually in the middle of the World Cup, so the biggest thing for me was that we didn\u2019t have to compete with an England game. Thankfully we\u2019ve got away with that one.  Cameroon \u2013 Steve Harley            Steve Harley is best known for his 1975 No1 hit Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me). His June tour of the UK includes shows at the Royal Albert Hall and Birmingham Symphony Hall. steveharley.com  Suitably overblown and pompous, this is a proper national anthem. Translated from its native French, the libretto does become a mish-mash of fourth-form poetry (\u201cO Cameroon, cradle of our ancestors/Go, stand, be jealous of your freedom\u201d, and other beauties such as, \u201cMay [your children] serve you as their sole purpose/To fulfil their duty forever\u2026\u201d), but given the full-blown orchestral treatment, with percussion, flutes, and horns of every type, played in a marching tempo, all-the-while betraying its French ancestry, it is a really stirring piece. It is musical and charming. Plus, it is short.      Group B Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features    Spain - James Blunt            James Blunt\u2019s album Back to Bedlam was the biggest-selling of the 2000s in the UK, selling over 3m copies, and spawned the single You\u2019re Beautiful, which reached No1 in 10 countries including the UK and the US. His latest album, Moon Landing, is out now. jamesblunt.com   Spain\u2019s national anthem, written in 1761, has no lyrics, so fans repeat just one word - \u201clo\u201d. This translates as \u2026 well \u2026 nothing. It\u2019s meaningless. And surely, if you\u2019re going to sing a song at football matches, that\u2019s what you want? Watching \u201cour lads\u201d pretending to mouth questionable lyrics about God giving the Queen near-immortal life, and her being the victor when she\u2019s not really of fighting age, is silly. We should strip our own national anthem back, and replace the lyrics with our own best-known meaningless word \u2013 \u201coi!\u201d Unless of course Big Liz turns up, and then we can stick in those other words \u2013 but she\u2019s not going to, is she?\u201d  Netherlands \u2013 Tinchy Stryder            Tinchy Stryder has had two UK No1 singles, Number 1 and Never Leave You. His latest album, 360\u00ba, is out in later this year. tinchystryder.com  I always enjoyed Holland as a national team, I\u2019m sure most people that grew up in my generation will feel the same. They always seem to have a few exciting players and obviously always had a great attacking philosophy. Plus Van Der Sar and Van Nistelrooy were incredible for my club; and even though he was Arsenal Bergkamp is one of the best players ever. I like the sound of the Dutch anthem, it\u2019s quite epic like a lot of national anthems. The strings and melody are nice. I don\u2019t speak Dutch so couldn\u2019t understand the lyrics at first, when I had a read through a translation I found them interesting, with references to Germany and Spain in there \u2013 turns out it\u2019s officially the oldest national anthem in the world and also is written in the first person perspective of William of Orange who fought for The Netherlands\u2019 independence. This national anthem will definitely provide a talking point with locals the next time I visit some of my favourite cafes in Amsterdam! I like it.  Chile - Eggsy            Goldie Lookin\u2019 Chain had a series of hits in 2004 and 2005, the biggest being Guns Don\u2019t Kill People Rappers Do. At the height of their fame, Eggsy came second in a special edition of Celebrity Weakest Link. youknowsit.co.uk   This track is an absolute belter, that wouldn\u2019t go amiss as the soundtrack to a good Sunday afternoon war film, which in turn conjures up images of that classic war/football movie Escape to Victory. I know nothing of football but I can hear pride in a rhythm from 50 yards and this tune blew my tits clean off. The Chileans have seen their fair share of political upheaval over the years and if this reflection of national spirit is anything to go by, then they more than deserve to win the World Cup and have a film made about it that\u2019s loosely based around World War Two. Is it possible to get Sylvester Stallone to play in goal for them? Can we get them a dressing room with a giant bath that leads to an escape tunnel? Is there any chance we can get Ossie Ardilles to come on as a ball boy for them? I just don\u2019t know, but at least every time I hear this great piece of music I can picture all this and more in my tiny drug-addled mind. Go Team Chile. My fave new football heroes.  Australia \u2013 Paul Smith            Paul Smith is the singer in Max\u00efmo Park, who have released five albums including Our Earthly Pleasures, which reached No2 in 2005, and this year\u2019s Too Much Information. maximopark.com  Australia\u2019s national anthem begins with the flourish of a classic Hollywood movie. I have no intention of ever watching Baz Luhrmann\u2019s \u2018Australia\u2019 but if he didn\u2019t use this piece of music to kickstart his reputedly overblown depiction of early Aussie settlers then he\u2019s missed a trick. As with many national anthems there\u2019s a whiff of an ice skating hall to the whole affair and the word \u2018gala\u2019 comes to mind when listening. In that respect, it resembles the pompous tune it replaced as official anthem in 1984 - God Save The Queen. At least it trumps its predecessor thanks to the inclusion of the word \u2018girt\u2019, which undercuts all the guff about \u201cgolden soil\u201d and being \u201cyoung and free\u201d by virtue of sounding like an Irishman saying \u2018girth\u2019.      Group C.    Colombia \u2013 Justin Howard-Young            Justin Young is the singer in The Vaccines, who have released two albums, 2011\u2019s What Did You Expect from the Vaccines? and Come of Age, which reached No1 in the UK the following year. thevaccines.co.uk  Before reading up on the story of the Colombian national anthem, I thought I would probably just create a history of my own, as very few would be any the wiser. But the truth is actually strange enough. \u00a1Oh Gloria Inmarcesible! (O Unfading Glory) essentially started life as a poem by former President Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez. It was bought to life in 1887, one year after the Republic of Colombia was declared, when an actor from Bogot\u00e1, named Jos\u00e9 Domingo Torres, asked his friend, the opera singer Oreste Sindici, to compose music against the words. It wasn\u2019t actually officially adopted until 1920. As a result of its poetic origins, and possibly its resemblance to Italian opera too, it is long. Too long I would say. Typically just one of it\u2019s eleven verses, normally the first, is sandwiched between two choruses. And the lyrics are as impassioned, emotive and colourful you\u2019d expect from a South American President in the 19th Century; \u2018In agony, the virgin tears out her hair\u2019 and \u2018the river runs with blood and weeping\u2019, for example. Good to know the next time we find ourselves lined up against them on the football field.  Greece \u2013 Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook            Chris Difford and Glenn Dilbrook are songwriters and vocalists in Squeeze, whose best-loved songs include Cool for Cats and Up the Junction, both No2 hits in 1979, and the 1981 No4 Labelled with Love. They are on tour in July. squeezeofficial.com  Glenn One of the versions of this on Youtube is 55 minutes long give or take a couple of seconds, which is befitting as according to Wikipedia it\u2019s the longest national anthem in the world.Chris If they sang the complete anthem at a football match, the game would kick off about 4pm and not 3pm.Glenn It makes you realise how skilled those early Hollywood songwriters were because they parody these sorts of things. It sounds almost Slavic with the stirring choir and the jaunty piano.Chris You go Slav if you like \u2026 when I first heard it it kind of reminded me of something that the Marx Brothers would interrupt. Does it make you feel patriotic?\u2019Glenn I\u2019m not Greek so I can\u2019t really say that it does.Chris They say Grease is the word, but it is like thousands of words by the sound of it.Glenn It\u2019s a fact that if we gave you a review of all 185 verses of the Greek national anthem we would have this entire feature to ourselvesChris What I like most about football when they sing the national anthem is the ambient vocal mic picking up the goalie singing really out of tune, and not really knowing the wordsGlenn We did just scan down a YouTube of the Greek team singing the national anthem (short version!) and there was a good deal of bluffing going onChris Anyway we will be back in a couple of days once this is over  Ivory Coast \u2013 Fatboy Slim            Norman Cook had No1 records with The Housemartins and Beats International before adopting the pseudonym Fatboy Slim. He has since topped the charts with the single Praise You in 1999 and the album You\u2019ve Come a Long Way, Baby, in 1998. His latest release is the compilation Fatboy Slim presents Bem Brasil, which is out now. fatboyslim.net  Normally I\u2019ve got all these electronic noises coming out of my office, and when I was listening to this my wife came in to check I was OK. I think it\u2019s quite a good one. It\u2019s in A flat major, which is always a stirring key. That\u2019s one semi-tone higher than God Save the Queen, if you\u2019re interested. It\u2019s a very traditional marching pace. It sounds like the Marseilleise part two, which is interesting as it\u2019s a post French-colonial effort. The lyrics are very traditional national-anthem stuff about a \u201cland of hope\u201d and \u201cfull gallant legions\u201d, and the pay-off at the end is \u201cthe fatherland of true brotherhood\u201d, which is half right-wing and half left-wing, which is probably what any good national anthem should aspire to. If you watch the team singing it before matches you learn a couple of things: some countries don\u2019t look very interested in their anthems but the Ivorians are quite stirred, and Yaya Tour\u00e9 is a loud singer but he\u2019s absolutely awful.  Japan \u2013 Una Healy            Una Healy is a member of the Saturdays, whose hits include Just Can\u2019t Get Enough, Forever is Over, and the UK No1 What About Us. She is married to the England rugby international Ben Foden. The Saturdays Greatest Hits is out on 11 August. thesaturdays.co.uk  I thought it was a lovely piece of music. It\u2019s very short so they often sing it twice. It was composed in the 1800s, and I could tell it was in the time of Tchaikovsky, in the classical romantic period. When I was listenting to it Ben thought it sounded like church music, because with the classical music behind it it might sound a bit churchy. I thought it was a nice piece of music and quite emotional and moving. Wherever you\u2019re from, when your anthem comes on you get quite patriotic, it seems to really rev you up. I want Ben play, and he gets so fired up when he\u2019s singing his anthem. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for footballers, and helps to release the nerves and the adrenaline when they\u2019re waiting for the game. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll watch a bit of the World Cup, even though there\u2019s no Irish team. I can still remember watching Italia 90, aged eight, with Niall Quinn and Paul McGrath in the team. I can still remember most of the team from then, but I could hardly name a player now.      Group D.    Uruguay \u2013 David Gray            David Gray has released three No1 albums \u2013 2000\u2019s White Ladder, A New Day at Midnight in 2002, and Life in Slow Motion three years later. His latest, Mutineers, is out now. davidgray.com  I\u2019m getting oodles of eastern pride with lusty overtones of death or glory, I\u2019m getting a spine of florid pomposity with top notes of Tom and Jerry, I\u2019m getting Viennese marching music with a strong hint of moustache oil, I\u2019m getting really bored, this thing goes on and on \u2026 Weighing in at a hefty five minutes, six seconds, this is officially the longest national anthem in the world.  Costa Rica \u2013 Tony Hadley            Tony Hadley is the singer in Spandau Ballet, whose hits included the UK No1 True, which went gold, and the No2 Gold, which went silver. spandauballet.com  It\u2019s an incredibly grandiose and rousing tune, extremely jolly and strident, almost like an operatic piece. It\u2019s a big anthem, and a big lyric, for a small country. The words talk about peace and blue skies and the nation as a \u201cloving mother\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s not as sabre-rattling as some other countries. I can imagine it played in the stadium, with all the fans \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how many fans Costa Rica take to a World Cup, but however many of them there are \u2013 singing and feeling very proud. There might be a few tears. I know from experience that when you\u2019re in that situation, singing a song that\u2019s meaningful to you and thousands of people joining in \u2013 whether it\u2019s a national anthem or Gold \u2013 it brings a sense of pride. It\u2019s a special moment. I visited Costa Rica a few years ago, and trekked from one side to the other to raise money for Action Medical Research, so I\u2019ve been there and experienced the country and the jungle. It\u2019s a fascinating and beautiful place. It took about 14 days to go from the Caribbean coast to the Pacific and it was a fabulous trip. We took a couple of short cuts.  England \u2013 Whigfield            Sannie Carlson, best known as Whigfield, became the first artist to go straight to No1 in the UK singles chart with her debut single with Saturday Night in 1994. She followed that up with the top 10 hits Another Day and Think of You. whigfield.eu  Researching this, I got really curious and spent an evening listening to the various anthems of the world. There are some good ones in there. I like the Danish one because it\u2019s very sweet, the Dutch one is very majestic, and Australia\u2019s reflects the way Australians are \u2013 they\u2019re very bright, joyful, easygoing, happy people \u2013 and Germany\u2019s quite militaristic. And God Save the Queen does that too \u2013 it\u2019s very subtle, calm and controlled, in the way people outside the UK think British people are. I wouldn\u2019t want to put these lyrics into a pop song, but they also reflect that mannered, reserved attitude. It was written in the middle of the 18th century, and it reflects I think the era it was made. It\u2019s how people spoke in those days. It\u2019s quite a good tune to sing along to, very simple, but I\u2019m not sure everyone connects with the words now. Watching the team as the anthem plays before a match some of the players are just mumbling along. I think that you should maybe rewrite the anthems every 50 years, because the world is moving so fast, and I think it would be interesting to hear what would be created  Italy - Joe Dolce            Joe Dolce spent three weeks at No1 in 1981 with the unforgettable Shaddup You Face and has since forged a second career as a poet. His latest book is Hatbox. joedolce.net  The National Anthem of Italy \u2013 Il Canto degli Italiani, which translates as The Song of the Italians \u2013 is a lively patriotic lyric, a musical mix between a church hymn and a military march. A rousing and bloody oompah-oompah call to arms against foreign occupiers. There\u2019s drinking blood, heartburn, Roman slaves, cohorts \u2013 Italians really are the experts at sticking it up authority. And partying afterwards. This song was sung by Garibaldi when he kicked the Bourbons out of Sicily. Some have said that it\u2019s not that challenging musically (I personally prefer the Russian National Anthem \u2013 which is written in a minor key and sounds bitchin\u2019 on the accordion) but Verdi himself championed this song as being of equal stature to God Save the Queen. And who\u2019s going to argue with Verdi?       Group E. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features    Switzerland - Josh Cuthbert            Josh Cuthbert is one quarter of Union J, a product of the ninth series of the X Factor. Despite finishing fourth they signed a record deal with Sony and have so far had two top 10 singles, Carry You and Beautiful Life, and a self-titled debut album. unionjofficial.com  It\u2019s not the most gripping, I\u2019ve got to say. I think it lacks that crowd appeal \u2013 I can\u2019t really imagine anyone singing along with it. It\u2019s important at a World Cup that the anthem rallies the fans and team before the game, and that\u2019s definitely missing here. It\u2019s very slow and doesn\u2019t really go anywhere, it kind of ploddles along. And then the lyrics are all about the weather and mountains and sunsets and clouds. I read that they\u2019re looking for a new one at the moment, and let\u2019s just say I can understand why. There\u2019s a prize of about \u00a37,000 for whoever writes the winning song, so maybe next time I\u2019m in the studio I\u2019ll stay behind for a bit and submit one to the parliament of Switzerland. An anthem is important for a country, it needs to be relevant and it needs to work, and if it isn\u2019t working they\u2019ve got to change it. I have to say I like God Save the Queen, I think that should stay just the way it is. Maybe a bit of guitar would be cool, but I think that\u2019s a solid national anthem. I think many countries will look at it and go, \u201cWow, that\u2019s a good one.\u201d They\u2019ll be very jealous. Especially the Swiss.  Ecuador \u2013 DJ Fresh            DJ Fresh has had two No1 singles, Louder in 2011 and Hot Right Now the following year. His new single, Make U Bounce, is released on 22 June. thedjfresh.com  I love Latin music and culture! My recent hit Dibby Sound with Jay Fay was heavily influenced by Brazilian samba axa music. It\u2019s so weird hearing other national anthems because you grow up with your national anthem, it\u2019s in your blood (literally). I\u2019m sure if I was Ecuadorean this would sound a lot less like a cross between jingle bells and onward Christian soldiers. I guess I was hoping for some of that incredible latin rhythmic heat! But hey, I grew up in maidenhead, so what do I know?  France \u2013 Engelbert Humperdinck            Engelbert Humperdinck had No1s with Please Release Me and The Last Waltz in 1967 and represented Britain in the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest. The duets album Engelbert Calling is out now. engelbert.com  The pomp, power and military bombast of La Marseillaise draws me into the history of France, and my own. The surname I was born with was French: D\u2019Orsay; perhaps an ancestor was amongst those troops that marched to this evocative anthem for the first time as they entered Paris 200 years ago! I think also of my dear friend Charles Aznavour, he\u2019s 90 now but we sang together on my latest album, Engelbert Calling. La Marseillaise sounds best ringing around a packed sports stadium. Its lyrics evoke revolution, conflict, taking up arms, preparing for the fight \u2013 everything my music does not! Even in our largely peaceful times it retains its rousing, martial air that gives it a power that hasn\u2019t diminished. A great stirring, inspiring anthem to take the field to!  Honduras \u2013 Carol Decker            Carol Decker is the lead singer in T\u2019Pau, whose hits included the 1987 No1 China in Your Hand. Their new album, Pleasure &amp; Pain, will be followed by a tour of England in October and November. tpau.co.uk  When you think of God Save the Queen, it\u2019s just one melody all the way through. This, though, is structured like a song \u2013 it\u2019s got a verse, a pre-chorus and then it goes into what I would call a chorus and then back to a verse. It\u2019s quite a jolly, memorable melody, punctuated with a lot of cymbals, which lock the melody down. The lyrics are almost a battle cry, full of dramatic lyrics \u2013 crashing waves, volcanoes, marching to the death. Personally I think our anthem is really dreary, but this has a better tempo, a more interesting structure. I think it\u2019s a good singalong, and can really picture them bellowing that out, very proud, before kick-off. I\u2019m not much of a football person, but I\u2019m a glory girl, so I\u2019ll tune in for the final, perhaps a semi-final. I doubt I\u2019ll see much of Honduras this summer.      Group F.

He also reached No1 with the album Playing In the Shadows in 2011. His new album, Live Life Living, is released on 30 June. trythisforexample.com  I\u2019ve watched a few videos of the national team whilst the anthem\u2019s being played. They don\u2019t seem to know the words. Or care that it\u2019s playing. This is odd because most Argentinian people I know are hugely patriotic. It\u2019s got a bit of an odd time signature to it, it\u2019s not as easy to singalong to as our own national anthem - maybe it\u2019s hard to sing along to something like this when you have a tango rhythm in your bones like the South Americans do? Also it\u2019s not every anthemic in my opinion, it\u2019s more like The Marriage Of Figaro. Apparently the old version had anti-Spanish lyrics! Naughty. They\u2019ve obviously changed that since for something a bit more Gallagher-esque as the translation goes: \u201cLet us live crowned in glory\u2026 or let us swear in glory to die!\u201d. Could be straight from Champagne Supernova couldn\u2019t it?  Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina \u2013 Jack Savidge             Jack Savidge is a DJ and the drummer in Friendly Fires, who were nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2009 for their self-titled debut album. The follow-up, Pala, reached No6 two years later. wearefriendlyfires.com   Ceremoniously slow and with a mood of solemn self-satisfaction and reflective pride, the most I can say about this is every note of it is archetypal national anthem fodder. The melody is reminiscent of any number of late Victorian hymn tunes- its verses end with perfect cadences following imperfect cadences at the halfway points, which creates comfortable if tired-sounding resolutions. In footballing terms its the stodgy 4-5-1 of a relegation-battling team of cloggers looking to flood the midfield and frustrate creativity. The lyrics aren\u2019t much better, praising Herzegovina\u2019s \u201cwonderful blue sky\u201d- not the strongest USP there. I\u2019d speculate that at B-H\u2019s inception something so bland was chosen to not inflame tensions between the ethnicities of the new state, what with Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims all having separate (and hopefully way more banging) anthems with which they identify.  Iran \u2013 Pat Kane            Pat Kane is the singer in Hue &amp; Cry, who stormed the top 10 with their debut single, Labour of Love, in 1987. Their latest release, the four-disc set Major to Minor, is out now. hueandcry.co.uk  On first listening, the Iran team\u2019s national anthem \u201cSoroud-e Melli-e Jomhouri-e Eslami-e Iran\u201d sounds like yer standard pomptastic European 19th-century neo-classicism. But do some musicology, and you find that Iran\u2019s precursor, Persia, has a strong clam to be the originator of the operatic form, with its song and drama tradition of Ta\u2019zieh. Symphonic music is hugely important in contemporary Iran, often inspired by a native classic tradition that goes back to the Sasanian empire in the 2nd century. Don\u2019t know how the team\u2019ll do. But the anthem \u2013 composed in 1990 \u2013 is competitive and fighting fit.  Nigeria \u2013 Mike Batt            In addition to masterminding the career of Katie Melua and writing many of her most successful songs including The Closest Thing to Crazy and Nine Million Bicycles, Batt\u2019s songwriting credits include Art Garfunkel\u2019s No1 Bright Eyes, and The Wombing Song. madhouserag.com  The lyric line, \u201cOne Nation bound in freedom, Peace and Unity\u201d is a bit of a tall order for most countries but sadly for Nigeria it is at most a hopeful dream. The song \u2013 which cannot be described as great art - like many National Anthems including our own, is strident and solemn, and could be hymn. Indeed several of its melodic lines are ripped straight from familiar hymns, specifically \u201cGuide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer\u201d (Bread Of Heaven). It serves the purpose as a familiar anthem and call for loyalty and togetherness. Its lack of originality combined with its passionate formulaic construction is probably why it sounds like most other National Anthems on Earth, and why it does the job and very little more!      Group G.    Germany \u2013 Chris De Burgh            Chris De Burgh\u2019s hits include the worldwide smash The Lady in Red, a No1 in 1986. His new album, The Hands of Man, will be released later this year. cdeb.com  I have a great connection with this piece of music, which was written by Haydn in 1797. I went to Marlborough College in Wiltshire, and they had a beautiful chapel where we had matins most days. I remember singing the hymn Glorious Things of Thee are Spoken, to this tune, which with 800 voices was a thrilling sound. I was brought up Church of Ireland, and one of my earliest memories would have been in church with mum and dad, listening to this melody. There\u2019s an interesting thing with music like this, how the beat falls with the melody; they often say music is mathematical in construction and this is a very good example. The melodic pattern repeats itself several times throughout, then you have a mid eight, and for me the most thrilling part is the reprise, those rising notes, and then it hits the top. It\u2019s a hell of a piece of music.  Portugal \u2013 Felix Buxton            Felix Buxton is one half of Basement Jaxx, whose hits include Red Alert, Rendez-Vu and Romeo, all included on the No1 complilation The Singles. Their new album, Junto, is out in August, and the current single is Unicorn. powertothepeople.fm  It sounds like a good bit of music and it\u2019s rousing, but I found the lyrics - \u201cto arms, to arms! For the fatherland, fight!\u201d - a bit steeped in warfare and the glory of battle. Anthems often revel in that, which I find personally is not in my mindset and hopefully most people in the modern world will feel like that. Anthems are a piece of your heritage, though, like your old racist grandma \u2013 you don\u2019t tell her to get lost just because her views are a little outdated. Melodically and as a piece of rousing hymnal music it\u2019s great. It\u2019s definitely the sort of thing I\u2019d drop in a DJ set \u2013 not the whole thing, just 30 seconds or so - because you feel it\u2019s the music of the people. I wrote with a friend something like a hymn, for the Olympics, and I played it to my dad who\u2019s a vicar and he said it was too lofty and wouldn\u2019t connect to the working man. Hopefully we\u2019ll complete it at some stage, but writing a hymn that connects to people and is uplifting is hard to do. I\u2019ll be watching the World Cup \u2013 when I was at school football supporting was about fighting and violence, but those days are gone. I\u2019ll always watch England, and experience that groaning feeling of depression as they\u2019re lauded and then they fail. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re lauded so much, all they do is kick a ball about.  Ghana \u2013 Nik Kershaw            Kershaw\u2019s hits include Wouldn\u2019t It Be Good, The Riddle and I Won\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on Me, and he also wrote Chesney Hawkes\u2019 1991 No1, The One and Only. nikkershaw.net  Apparently, this was adopted to take over from \u201cGod save the Queen\u201d when Ghana stopped being a British colony in 1957. Ironically, you\u2019d be hard pushed to find anything more British. Sounds like it was rescued from Elgar\u2019s recycling bin. I\u2019m struggling to understand why they couldn\u2019t come up with something a little more \u201cindependent\u201d sounding to celebrate their Independence. That said, it contains all the elements required to stir the loins: a glorious and triumphant opening string and brass salvo, followed by a regal and stately middle section (to the manor born), building to a rabble rousing climax. Classic stuff. Looking forward to hearing Michael Essien belt this one out.  United States \u2013 Tim Booth            Tim Booth is the singer in James, who have had 10 top-20 albums over the last 20 years and enjoyed hits including Sit Down and She\u2019s a Star. Their latest album, La Petite Mort, is out now. wearejames.com  \u201cIt\u2019s a decent melody, actually quite rousing. Like most anthems it\u2019s intended to create unity in the face of adversity, coming from a time when America was a new country trying to forge its identity. It\u2019s certainly better than God Save the Queen, because it\u2019s less sturgy and ploddy, but my theory is that anthems should be changed quite frequently so they reflect the times we live in, in a language we understand. \u201cO\u2019er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming\u201d \u2013 what does it mean? It\u2019s a martial national anthem and maybe in peacetime, or something close to it, we should be having more forward-thinking anthems, with lyrics that inspire us to be more inclusive of races and genders. I think in Britain we\u2019re aware that our country has seen better days, and we\u2019re a bit more cynical about the flag-waving thing. America\u2019s a younger country, with more naivety and innocence to it, and they believe they were born into the best country on earth. They do what humans do when they\u2019re extremely fortunate, which is to say God gave it to them, or that they earned it in some way, when in fact there\u2019s a lot of luck involved, and these things are always cyclical. I find the World Cup fascinating. I\u2019m less interested in the tribalism of soccer, but I watch Barcelona every week and when they play at their best it\u2019s with a shoal mentality. They\u2019re like a murmur of crows, they seem able to read where their team-mates are going with something close to telepathy. Watching it can touch you, in a way some artists can when the ego disappears into the creation. And Barcelona at their best are art, and Spain, Brazil, Holland have been, and other teams will be.\u201d      Group H.    Belgium \u2013 Kate Nash            Kate Nash is best remembered for the 2007 No2 Foundations, from the No1 album Made of Bricks. She was named best female artist at the Brit Awards in 2008. myignorantyouth.com  I love the lyrics. \u201cOur heart and soul are dedicated to you. Our strength and the blood of our veins we offer.\u201d This is the kind of thing I want to hear from my next boyfriend. I also love the idea that it was originally written by some young people in a cafe. I\u2019m a fan of epic crescendos so I\u2019m glad that\u2019s how the piece ends. If I was in charge of re-recording, I think I would add more swooping crescendos that don\u2019t come down \u2013 they just keep getting bigger. All in all, I feel like I should be windswept and on my way to overcoming something emotionally difficult when I\u2019m listening to this anthem. It sort of has a \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d vibe. It feels sonically stoic, proud and dignified.  Algeria \u2013 Ed Harcourt            Ed Harcourt has released six albums, of which the first \u2013 2001\u2019s Here Be Monsters \u2013 was nominated for the Mercury Prize. edharcourt.com  On first listening it didn\u2019t strike me as the catchiest national anthem that I\u2019ve heard, though I\u2019m not completely au fait with all the world\u2019s national anthems. But then I listened to it a couple of times and it really started to grow on me. The music, all trumpets and strings, is quite rousing, quite full-on. Then I looked at the lyrics, and what strikes you is the crazy dichotomy of the very perky music, and these incredibly revolutionary lyrics. They use a poem that Mufdi Zakariah, a prisoner of French colonial forces in the 1950s, wrote in his own blood on the wall of his cell. It\u2019s very powerful, very stirring. Even in translation there are some great lines \u2013 \u201cwe have taken the drum of gunpowder as our rhythm and the sound of machine guns as our melody\u201d. It\u2019s a very positive, very proud lyric, very much of its time. There\u2019s no mention of any one person, or any specific leader \u2013 it\u2019s a song to bind a people, and a nation. It\u2019s unusual for an anthem to mention another country like France is mentioned here, which roots it to a particular period of their history. Maybe they don\u2019t ever want to forget about the oppression, but I wonder if maybe in 100 years time someone might say, \u2018We can forget about France now.\u2019  Bonus review! Algeria \u2013 Steve Brookstein Steve Brookstein was the winner of the first series of The X Factor in 2004. His debut single, Against All Odds, and album, Heart and Soul, both reached No1. His new album Forgotten Man is out now. stevebrookstein.com  The Algerian national anthem is quite an upbeat ditty but is pretty repetitive. The lyrics are from a poem called Qassaman by Mufdi Zakariah, which he wrote while he was being held as a political prisoner by France in 1957, so despite it\u2019s chirpiness it talks of guns, blood, fighting, freedom and more blood. When Zakariah wrote \u201cso we have taken the drum of gunpowder as our rhythm, and the sound of machine guns as our melody,\u201d he wouldn\u2019t have known composer Mohamed Fawzi would accidentally borrow a bit from The Laughing Policeman. Not the greatest melody for a national anthem but the lyrics are bound to evoke memories of the bloody fight for independence. I find songs based on poems rarely work but it does have a pop at the French so it\u2019s not all bad.   Russia \u2013 Joe Elliott            Joe Elliott is the singer in Def Leppard, who have sold 100 million records worldwide, with their biggest album, 1987\u2019s Hysteria, selling 20 million. Their most successful singles include Let\u2019s Get Rocked and When Love and Hate Collide, which both reached No2 in the UK charts. The Further Adventures Of \u2026, the second album by his other band, Down \u2018n\u2019 Outz, is out now. downnoutz.com  My first impression was: my god that does go on a bit. I always thought all anthems were like ours, 30 seconds long. But then there are loads of other verses to God Save the Queen that we never bother with because we get bored. The Russian one\u2019s got all the key attributes of a good anthem \u2013 it\u2019s grandiose, over the top, classical leaning, a bit intimidating \u2013 but it just went on and on and on. Lyrically it is a bit overbearing, and there\u2019s no mention of food or vodka, which is a bit strange. I read that they only introduced this anthem in 2000. Imagine if someone tried to change our anthem \u2013 there\u2019d be uproar. I can just picture the front page of the Sun. The thing about anthems is that you never listen to them because you want to \u2013 it\u2019s always forced upon you. You\u2019re at a stadium, waiting for the start of a match, and you\u2019re trapped. It\u2019s like if you\u2019re taking a road trip in a mate\u2019s car and he makes you listen to the whole of the new Duran Duran album. You can\u2019t get out. I remember we played a gig in Russia about five years ago. The fans were great, but someone gave us Russian dolls of ourselves, which was a bit weird. They were really well done. At least we got paid \u2013 back in the 70s an English band called UFO played in Russia and they were paid in trombones. They weren\u2019t allowed to bring roubles out of the country, so they were given things they could sell.We\u2019ll be touring America during the World Cup but I\u2019ll watch every game I can. I might glue an iPad to my wedge so I can keep up with scores while we\u2019re on. Are England going to win it? Of course not. On home soil Brazil have to have a chance, but then I don\u2019t really know how good their team is because I haven\u2019t seen it.  South Korea \u2013 Lethal Bizzle            Lethal Bizzle is a rapper, an actor, and the cousin of the former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong. His biggest hit was his debut, Oi!, which reached No11 in 2002. His latest single, The Drop, is out now.  I didn\u2019t know anthems were so long. Normally at a football match it\u2019s about a minute, and this is about three and a half minutes long. The weird thing about anthems is that they all sound very similar, all those big melodies and stuff. Why are they all sung in an operatic style? I don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s not where it is right now. To be fair, at first it had that epic appeal to it, almost like the Champions League opening music. Me personally, that\u2019s not going to get me excited for a game. I want to hear DMX or something. 2Pac maybe. Something energetic that\u2019s going to get you hyper. I might as well fall asleep as listen to this. The last international match I went to was England v Ghana at Wembley. Both of those anthems, they\u2019re nice and simple \u2013 about one minute, it\u2019s done. Maybe the Koreans do a short version, a bit of an edit. I hope so.

Although the painting is signed and dated, experts have been arguing about the painting of Saint Praxedis for decades, since it was first suggested that it was a genuine early work by the artist, painted when he was 23, newly converted to Catholiciism and heavily influenced by Italian art. Christie&apos;s auctioneers say that the latest scientific analysis, by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, shows that the lead white paint extensively used in the painting was made in northern Europe, and precisely matches another undisputed early work by Vermeer, Diana and Her Companions. The use of the brilliant blue pigment, ultramarine, is also typical of Vermeer&apos;s work, they say.

Here is an overview of the tax affairs of the three firms under investigation. Apple In 2011 $22bn (\u00a313.1bn) of the iPhone maker&apos;s profits \u2013 almost two-thirds of its global profits \u2013 were made by a handful of companies registered in the group&apos;s relatively modest offices north of Cork, in Ireland. American senators have complained that the California-based group should be booking those profits in the US, where the products are designed and developed. &quot;You shifted that golden goose to Ireland,&quot; said Carl Levin, Democratic senator from Michigan, in a hearing with Apple boss Tim Cook. Using investigatory powers not available to their UK counterparts, staff on the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, chaired by Levin, revealed details of how Apple&apos;s Irish companies managed to get their tax bill down to less than 1%. Ireland&apos;s surprising role in Apple&apos;s success story is traced back to a deal in the 1980s, when the company&apos;s founder Steve Jobs arranged for a portion of the economic rights to exploit the group&apos;s intellectual property \u2013 technology developed in California \u2013 to be transferred from a US Apple company to a new Irish Apple company. Whether this deal, and more importantly subsequent &quot;cost-sharing&quot; deals between Apple in the US and Ireland, are unfairly distorting the way the group reports profits has been the cause of debate. The detail the US Senate committee unearthed had not been available in Irish accounts filed at the Companies Registration Office because the group structured these businesses as unlimited companies, which are not required to make such filings. The Senate staff found that some of these Irish companies seemed to have no tax residency anywhere in the world. The Irish tax authorities treated them as American businesses for tax purposes because these companies are managed and controlled from the US. At the same time, American tax law looked more at the companies&apos; registration in Ireland and determined that their profits were not taxable in the US. This was, said Levin, &quot;the holy grail of tax avoidance&quot;. In sworn testimony before the a senate hearing in May last year, Apple chief executive Tim Cook suggested the group&apos;s ties to Ireland could be traced back to a deal Steve Jobs had struck with the authorities in Dublin in the 1980s. At that time, Cook told the US politicians, Ireland was &quot;very much recruiting tech companies \u2026 [and] did give us a tax incentive agreement to enter there&quot;. This caused great embarrassment for politicians in Ireland, who were at pains to deny any sweetheart arrangements. On Wednesday, Apple seemed to modify its position, saying: &quot;We have received no selective treatment from Irish officials. Apple is subject to the same tax laws as scores of other international companies doing business in Ireland.&quot; In October last year, the Irish government pledged to introduce new rules on determining tax residency in the wake of senate committee allegations that it was behaving like &quot;a tax haven&quot;. Finance minister Michael Noonan said he would make it illegal for a company registered in Ireland to have no tax domicile anywhere. Starbucks Starbucks was heavily criticised by MPs on the UK public accounts committee after it emerged in 2012 that the business had paid just \u00a38.3m in tax since coming to the UK in 1998, despite posting sales of more than \u00a33bn. The British subsidiary of the US group had been substantially loss-making in large part because of a string of payments to other group companies for supply of coffee, for royalty payments and in interest on intra-group loans. Such payments between companies within the same organisation are essential to the functioning of multinational businesses and such intra-group deals are estimated to account for about half of all global commerce. There are rules, however, designed to ensure that companies don&apos;t manipulate these transactions so that profits ultimately arise in low-tax jurisdictions and costs in territories with higher tax rates. It is Starbucks&apos;s application of these rules \u2013 so-called transfer pricing rules \u2013 that have been the focus of controversy. In the face of widespread outrage, Starbucks pointed out that its tax affairs had been approved by HMRC, it also told MPs the group had legitimately secured a tax deal with the Netherlands that gave &quot;a very low tax rate&quot;. Asked what the rate was, Starbucks&apos;s Seattle-based chief financial officer Troy Alstead, who has since been promoted to chief operating officer, told the public accounts committee: &quot;The tax authority, under our Dutch ruling, has asked us not to share that publicly.&quot; Facing a UK consumer boycott, Starbucks eventual responded in December 2012 with &quot;a commitment \u2026 to pay a significant amount of corporation tax during 2013 and 2014, regardless of whether our company is profitable&quot;. The pledge saw Starbucks agree to temporarily unwind aggressive intra-group transactions that had depressed UK taxable profits. This moratorium will expire in December this year, and the company has suggested it will result in an extra \u00a320m of UK tax being paid. Starbucks&apos;s European head office business in Amsterdam has been loss-making since 2010, and paid just \u20ac342,000 (\u00a3281,500) in tax last year on a loss of \u20ac3.9m. This was despite taking revenues of \u20ac92.5m, mainly in royalty fees from regional coffee shop chains across Europe and the Middle East. The Dutch business ended up reporting a loss after heavy deductions, notably \u20ac27.8m of salary costs and a \u20ac52m payment to other entities within the Starbucks group relating to yet more royalty agreements. Fiat Fiat Finance and Trading (FFT), based in Luxembourg, describes itself as the &quot;main treasury and financing vehicle for the Fiat group outside of Italy&quot;. That means it raises debt, largely in the form of bonds, and lends on sums to sister companies within the Fiat group. Its affairs have, to date, escaped the public and parliamentary scrutiny that Apple and Starbucks have had to endure. But the small print of Fiat&apos;s annual report does note &quot;the group is subject to the risks inherent to operating globally, including \u2026 regulations relating to transfer pricing \u2026 to or from subsidiaries.&quot; Filings in Luxembourg show the business at the end of last year had \u20ac9.9bn (\u00a38bn) of loans to sister companies, and for 2013 it received interest payments on those loans of more than \u20ac710m. FFT posted a profit of \u20ac2.3m last year on which it booked a tax charge of \u20ac987,500 \u2013 higher than the 29% headline rate in Luxembourg because, it said, of activities in other jurisdictions. FFT filings say it complies with a number of codes of conduct, including OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises. These guidelines state: &quot;Corporate citizenship in the area of taxation implies that enterprises should comply with both the letter and the spirit of the tax laws \u2026 Transfer pricing is a particularly important issue for corporate citizenship and taxation.&quot;", "sentences": ["Starbucks&apos;s European head office business in Amsterdam has been loss-making since 2010, and paid just \u20ac342,000 (\u00a3281,500) in tax last year on a loss of \u20ac3.9m."], "title": "Apple, Starbucks and Fiat's tax affairs examined by European commission", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/11/apple-starbucks-fiat-tax-affairs-european-commission", "tags": ["Starbucks", "European commission", "Apple", "Fiat", "Technology", "Business", "World news", "Europe", "Tax and spending", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-12T12:16:00Z", "article": "Upstairs in the Crosby Street hotel in New York, 20-year-old Ansel Elgort has been talking about himself all day. Down in the basement, film journalists pick at the buffet. One of them, speaking with an air of special knowledge, tells me Elgort is very tired. &quot;You should take him some cookies, he&apos;ll need the sugar,&quot; he advises firmly. He&apos;s so unequivocal that when I&apos;m ushered upstairs I find I&apos;m holding three choc-chip cookies wrapped in a napkin. Elgort and Shailene Woodley star in The Fault in Our Stars, based on John Green&apos;s cultish bestseller about two teen cancer patients who meet at a support group and fall in love.  When the trailer was first released on YouTube, it clocked up a record-breaking three million views in 24 hours; when the movie was released in the US last week, it sped past Tom Cruise to the top of the box office. It looks to do for Elgort what Twilight did for Robert Pattinson. But while Pattinson graduated to adult roles after Twilight, Elgort is there already, as the lead in Men, Women and Children, Jason Reitman&apos;s latest, opposite Adam Sandler and Emma Thompson. As I enter the room, he&apos;s standing on the windowsill regarding Manhattan below him. So, is he exhausted after this day of press? &quot;I&apos;m never exhausted; I&apos;m a crazy m&apos;fucker,&quot; he says, in a confident torrent, as he dismounts with a leap. &quot;This is the beginning of this journey.&quot; I offer him the cookies anyway. His comically movie-star-perfect features squish into a quick frown. &quot;Are these poisoned?&quot; I&apos;m a bit taken aback. No, they&apos;re fine.     With Woodley in The Fault in Our Stars    Woodley and Elgort work sweetly together on screen. She&apos;s wry and shrewd \u2013 a counterbalance to his easy swagger. The audience at the press screening I attended turned swiftly into a noisy orchestra of weeping. My irritation over the heartstring pulling was only compounded by how impossible it was to resist.  So did he cry when he watched it? &quot;Yeah, of course,&quot; he shoots. &quot;Big time. The first time I cried was I think\u00a0...&quot; He chews a cookie while he thinks. And then: &quot;Well, I cry whenever I watch an emotional scene that I did, just because it brings me back to that moment. It&apos;s like I remember being there, I remember feeling what I felt. It&apos;s really weird, right?&quot; Mawkish though it is, I tell him I&apos;d left the screening feeling lucky to be healthy. &quot;There are so many things to be lucky for,&quot; he agrees. &quot;Lucky to be healthy, lucky to be, like, beautiful. Lucky to be living in America. It&apos;s like: what the fuck. It&apos;s crazy. I feel like I have more luck than 99.999% of people in the whole world.&quot; A pause. &quot;I&apos;m a lucky fuck.&quot; He is indeed. That he acknowledges his gilded upbringing is heartening, too. He is the youngest son of an opera director and a fashion photographer; his sister, Sophie, is a photographer, and his older brother, Warren, a film-maker. The whole family looks like a walking Ralph Lauren ad.     With his father at the Fault in Our Stars after party. Photograph: Startraks Photo/REX    When Elgort made his first chat show appearance on Jimmy Kimmel earlier this year, the host whipped out an image of the supermodel Karol\u00edna Kurkov\u00e1. Lying on the floor beside her is a profoundly unbothered little boy: the photographer&apos;s son. &quot;My dad said to always do what I loved and not worry about the money or anything, because if I do what I love then the money will come.&quot; Encouraged by both parents, he began ballet classes when he was nine, then went to LaGuardia High, a performing arts school whose alumni include Jennifer Aniston and Adrien Brody. His first movie role was in last year&apos;s Carrie remake, as the smooth jock who also happens to be sensitive enough to woo the school wallflower out of her shell. (Somewhat of a rehearsal, then, for The Fault in Our Stars.) Being on a film set for the first time seems not to have fazed him one bit.     Elgort in Carrie     &quot;It wasn&apos;t scary, that was the thing. I was totally confident because I&apos;d worked so long training and stuff. I knew how to act.&quot; Then came Divergent, another Young Adult smash, in which he played Woodley&apos;s brother. &quot;Shailene,&quot; he says, &quot;is a very different person to most people. She&apos;s very unique. She has, some would say, odd ways of living.&quot; Like what? &quot;Like she eats only certain types of food, she cooks a certain way. But the nice thing was that she was able to speak about life spiritually and I think at that point in my life \u2013 I was 19 \u2013 I&apos;d never thought about any of that kind of stuff. So I was like: wow that&apos;s interesting. I&apos;d never talked to anybody like that but I guess Shailene talks to her friends like that all the time.&quot;     With Woodley in Divergent    &quot;Shailene and I share a certain love,&quot; he says, &quot;but it&apos;s a friendship love.&quot; This, he thinks, is also what their characters in this new film enjoy. &quot;I think it&apos;s more than a love story, it&apos;s like the opposite of Romeo and Juliet \u2013 it&apos;s not lust; it&apos;s real love. And, y&apos;know, they have sex just because they&apos;re in Amsterdam and are probably never going to have sex otherwise \u2013 so let&apos;s do it, I guess. But really, they&apos;re there just because they love each other. That&apos;s why it&apos;s refreshing because it&apos;s not, like, cheesy luurve.&quot; It&apos;s curious Elgort&apos;s conception of &quot;real love&quot; seems to sideline sex. Particularly since his Instagram account (1.5m followers and counting) does little to discourage the female gaze. &quot;It&apos;s important power,&quot; he says of his online reach. &quot;Because there are some celebrities who have millions and millions of people following them and they don&apos;t lead by example. I think one of the best people on Twitter is John Green [author of The Fault in Our Stars]. He leads by example and he encourages millions of people to do good things. And there are people who don&apos;t, and it&apos;s a waste, y&apos;know? I look to John as a role model and whenever I&apos;m unsure of something I&apos;m like: &apos;Would John tweet this?&apos; &quot;I&apos;m happy to be a role model because I think I can do it over other people. I think my parents raised me well. And I&apos;m pretty straight edge. All my friends make fun of me for being straight edge. Like we go out and I&apos;m not really drinking. But they understand why \u2013 I&apos;m doing really well, I&apos;m really focused always on the prize. I want to keep creating and making important things and that&apos;s what I want Ansel Elgort to be about.&quot;     On The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Photograph: Nbc/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images    It&apos;s a bit of a shock, the third-person reference. But such brand-awareness is presumably part and parcel of being a pin-up in 2014. For Elgort, this savvy seems to come naturally; perhaps more so to him than his peers. I ask how he feels about the Pattinson comparisons and whether he&apos;s ready for that level of attention. &quot;I don&apos;t compare myself to anyone, but yeah, in certain ways it&apos;s really nice because a lot of people like Robert Pattinson. I think I&apos;m a lot more ready than a lot of people. I&apos;m willing to hopefully encourage people to do good things.&quot; Fame at this pitch holds no fears for a man apparently allergic to anxious introspection.

Since then it has only been heard once, at the Muziekgebouw in Amsterdam in 2011, the source of this recording. Though large-scale contemporary choral pieces are never the easiest works to programme, it&apos;s hard to see why Bryars&apos; work has been neglected; it&apos;s a thoughtful and worthwhile piece, neither especially dramatic nor poetically beautiful, but with a cumulative intensity that creates something more lasting than the sum of its parts. There are two sharply contrasted texts. The chorus sing a setting of lines from Genesis A, the eighth-century Anglo-Saxon paraphrase of the first book of the Bible sometimes attributed to the Northumbrian poet Caedmon, which describe the casting out of rebellious angels from heaven, while the soloists, soprano (Anja-Nina Bahrmann) and male alto (Maarten Engeltjes), share a monologue by the US playwright Sam Shepard about a very different kind of fallen angel. The contrast works well, and Bryars dovetails the texts in such a way that their relationship is constantly shifting, with first one, then the other in the foreground, and the orchestra providing understated support. At one point, the orchestral writing in The War in Heaven seems to allude to Parsifal, and Wagner also seems to lurk in the background of the Epilogue from G, the work that completes the disc. G, Being the Confession and Last Testament of Johannes Gensfleisch also known as Gutenberg, Master Printer, formerly of Strasbourg and Mainz, to give it its full title, was the opera that Bryars composed in 2002 to mark the 600th anniversary of the birth of the man who is credited with the invention of printing. The epilogue of the opera, set in the present day with the elderly Gutenberg musing on his achievement and asking to be left in peace now that the age of printing has passed, is conceived like a solo cantata for bass-baritone (Hans-Otto Weiss), accompanied by strings and off-stage brass; it seems musically self-sufficient, and striking in\u00a0its sombre, reflective way.", "sentences": ["Since then it has only been heard once, at the Muziekgebouw in Amsterdam in 2011, the source of this recording."], "title": "Bryars: The War in Heaven, Epilogue from G review \u2013 a work of cumulative intensity", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/12/bryars-war-in-heaven-epilogue-from-g-cd-review", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Gavin Bryars"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-12T14:56:00Z", "article": "Monet \u2013 The Beach at Trouville (1870) Wind and sand get in your eyes when you look at this astonishingly immediate painterly snapshot of a moment at the seaside. This is a masterpiece of impressionism, and when it was painted its fast, natural, flowing perceptions were utterly removed from what people expected a painting to look like. The beaches of Normandy, especially Trouville, gave the impressionists a perfect arena where middle-class pleasure and unpredictable nature created moments of spontaneity and surprise. Weegee \u2013 Coney Island (1940) This is a great photograph of the &quot;greatest generation&quot;, the young Americans who would soon be fighting in the second world war. It is an image of community and democracy. An entire city seems to be enjoying itself on the beach as the modern age is born in new attitudes to sex, the body and youth. It is as touching as one of Philip Roth&apos;s novels about the world he grew up in \u2013 a photograph of a nation coming into its golden age. Massimo Vitali \u2013 Cefal\u00f9 (2008)     Photograph: Foam gallery, Amsterdam/PR    This panorama of modern beach life at Cefal\u00f9 in Sicily is both beautiful and eerie. There are so many of us (I&apos;m not in the picture but have swum there). Observe the trajectory. In 19th-century paintings, heavily clothed Victorians tread warily on the beach. In 20th-century beach art, the clothes get skimpier. And in the 21st, the sea is dotted with people, all buying into the cult of sun, sand and sea. Vitali&apos;s bleached-out beach scene is an ironic view of Italy today as a false paradise. Degas \u2013 Beach Scene (1869-70)     Photograph: The National Gallery    There is an unreal and theatrical quality to this strange beach scene. For other impressionist painters \u2013 above all Monet \u2013 the seaside offered sheer spontaneity, but here Degas mocks that innocence. His beach scene was probably concocted in the studio, and looks it. He deliberately undermines the naturalness that seaside scenes seem made for, and in doing so questions the very nature of realism in art. Andre Derain \u2013 Fishing Boats, Collioure (1905) The seaside has seen some of art&apos;s most important revolutions. Impressionism found a perfect home on the beaches of Normandy. In 1905, Derain and Henri Matisse shared an epiphany of light and colour at the Mediterranean harbour town of Collioure. Here the fishing boats lined up on its beach give Derain a sparkling subject for a painting that revels in liberated, raw colour. Fauvism is born. Salvador Dal\u00ed \u2013 The Persistence of Memory (1931)     Photograph: Felix H Rhager/DPA/Corbis    This renowned, dreamlike painting of melting watches may seem an abstract creation, a conceptual response to Freud and Einstein that is an icon of all that is modern about modern art, but it is also a painstakingly accurate beach scene. The seaside setting on which Dal\u00ed lays out his soft watches is not a fantasy but is immediately recognisable if you take a postcard of this painting to Cadaqu\u00e9s in Catalonia. This beach that was part of Dal\u00ed&apos;s childhood landscape appears again and again in his wildest images. David Cox \u2013 Rhyl Sands (1854-5) It may not look too much fun, but before the impressionists took to the seaside, British painters were already experimenting with beach scenes. The heavily dressed, cold-looking and perhaps utterly miserable Victorians gathered in dark clumps on this bleak Welsh beach are painted by Cox with a free, open and sensitive eye. Picasso \u2013 Two Women Running on the Beach (1922)     Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP    No artist has ever felt and guided the pulse of his times as precisely as Picasso. In an art that often seems intensely private and in styles that appear to follow no rule but originality, he also manages to sum up social changes as they happen. This grand and generously classical image perfectly portrays the new freedom claimed by women after the first world war \u2013 a new age of gender relations that Picasso clearly welcomes \u2013 in a moment of fun and ecstasy by the sea. Luchino Visconti \u2013 Final scene from Death in Venice (1971)     Death in Venice screen grab    In the long, steadily filmed, elaborately choreographed final shots of his masterly film Death in Venice, the great Italian director Visconti restages the 19th-century beach scenes of Monet and Degas, watching the heavily clad ladies and frolicking kids from what seems a vast historical distance, as he examines history through a Marxist telescope. It seems that a whole way of life \u2013 a way of life expressed perfectly in the Victorian discovery of the seaside \u2013 is dying along with Dirk Bogarde as the world of the bourgeoisie drifts towards its destruction in a new age of revolution. Cue Mahler on the soundtrack. Henri Matisse \u2013 View of Collioure (The Tower) (1905) The genius of Matisse bursts out in the radical, broken brushwork and free colour of this painting he made while experimenting alongside Andr\u00e9 Derain in a small southern seaside town. It was just 35 years since Monet painted at Trouville, yet here is a new world, a new art, a new consciousness that has shattered the confines and comforts of the 19th century.

Of late, though, she has been devoting more time to personal projects. As she writes in a short essay for this book, she travelled to the rainforest village of Pikin Slee in Suriname \u2013 formerly Dutch Guiana \u2013 in 2012 in search of &quot;a simpler kind of photography&quot;. Gone is the elaborate staging and, to a surprising degree, the bold colours; in their place, a simpler way of looking at an isolated settlement and its people. The Saramaka tribe are descendants of Maroons who fled from slave plantations in the 18th century. Initially, Sassen, who was born and lives in Amsterdam but spent her childhood in Kenya, was drawn to their traditional way of life in a place of &quot;overwhelming nature&quot;. Over time, she became intrigued by &quot;the strange lines of faith that tied together my own history and theirs&quot;. Pikin Slee is a more understated book than previous monographs such as Flamboya and Parasomnia, their titles alone suggesting her often hallucinatory merging of documentary and fine art photography. She is still drawn, though, to the heightened otherness of the everyday, which is everywhere in Pikin Slee: a woman&apos;s striped dress that has the searing optical intensity of a Bridget Riley painting; a single white saucepan in a sea of darkness that resembles a composition by the painter William Scott; circles of freshly baked flatbreads drying on a tin rooftop in the sun.     Suriname, 2013, Vapour, by Viviane Sassen, from the book Pikin Slee. Photograph: Prestel    For all her embrace of simplicity, Sassen remains a formalist at heart, and the arresting power of her images often depends on the abstraction of a few objects \u2013 cooking utensils, basins, fabrics \u2013 from their everyday uses. A black basin teeming with water looks like a container of bubbling oil or tar; a human figure looks ghostly behind a swath of light-blue cloth. Mostly, though, she simply observes \u2013 and frames \u2013 the things that catch her eye and imbues them with a surprising geometry. Some of the more abstract forms recall Edward Weston at his most experimental in their play of light and shadow, but this is unmistakably a Viviane Sassen book, albeit a more muted and considered one.

Called &quot;chavs&quot; in Britain, &quot;white trash&quot; in Sweden, and featuring in a reality-TV genre called &quot;Aso-TV&quot; (&quot;anti-sociables television&quot;) in the Netherlands, white working-class people are often depicted as poor, unsocialised and sometimes violent, says the OSF. In Germany, they are stereotyped in what some call &quot;Hartz-IV television&quot;, a reference to the welfare system on which many poorer citizens rely. Such stereotyping makes its subjects particularly susceptible to messages from populist rightwing parties, the report says. Over a year, the OSF carried out research involving focus groups in areas of six European cities where the white working class dominates: Higher Blackley in north Manchester; Trigeparken in Aarhus, Denmark; Marzahn-Hellersdorf in Berlin; Lyon&apos;s eighth arrondissement, Southern Botkyrka in Stockholm and Amsterdam-North. The Manchester researchers argue that the misrepresentation of members of the white working class is a function of an unequal society, where they are largely excluded from jobs in the media and where stereotypes strengthen the perception of the poor deserving their poverty. This in itself, the researchers argue, affects public policy because decisions are based on the idea that people&apos;s circumstances are the result of their own poor choices, such as poor diet and irresponsible management of personal finances. In Higher Blackley, participants complained of journalists being &quot;all born with a silver spoon in their mouth&quot;, and said working-class people had little opportunity to correct damaging stereotypes of themselves.", "sentences": ["Over a year, the OSF carried out research involving focus groups in areas of six European cities where the white working class dominates: Higher Blackley in north Manchester; Trigeparken in Aarhus, Denmark; Marzahn-Hellersdorf in Berlin; Lyon&apos;s eighth arrondissement, Southern Botkyrka in Stockholm and Amsterdam-North."], "title": "Media 'sideline Europe's white working class', study finds", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/16/media-sideline-european-white-working-class-study-finds", "tags": ["Media", "Europe", "World news", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-16T11:42:37Z", "article": "Greenpeace International has parted company with one of its employees after the organisation lost \u20ac3.8m (\u00a33m) of donations last year through speculation on currency markets. n employee at the environmental campaign group&apos;s Amsterdam headquarters took out currency exchange contracts that speculated on a weak euro in the second half of 2013, the organisation said in a statement. As a result of the euro strengthening later in the year, Greenpeace had to file record losses when closing accounts at the end of the year. Its 2013 annual report will show a budget deficit of \u20ac6.8m. &quot;We offer a full apology to our supporters for the series of errors that led to the loss,&quot; a statement from Greenpeace said. &quot;We further wish to reassure people that every possible action is being taken to avoid the possibility of such a loss ever occurring again in future.&quot; Greenpeace says the staff member, who worked in its international finance unit, was not acting for personal gain, but had failed to obtain authorisation from senior management. He has since been released from his contract. With an annual income of \u20ac72.9m in 2013, the loss of \u20ac3.8m represents a significant hit for Greenpeace International, though the environmental group said none of its current campaigns would be affected. Greenpeace International has combined funds from more than 40 national organisations and a global budget of around \u20ac300m. The most significant damage may be to the trust of its supporters: 90% of the organisation&apos;s funding comes from small donations of less than \u20ac100. Greenpeace&apos;s international programme director, Pascal Husting, told the Guardian that the organisation did not generally use its funds to make investments or speculate on the stock market, but kept money in deposit accounts where it could be withdrawn quickly when needed, such as when 28 of its activists were arrested after staging a protest at a Russian offshore oil rig last year. However, Husting said that since Greenpeace received most of its donations in euros but had to spend them in other currencies, the organisation was highly exposed to currency fluctuations and took out exchange contracts to protect its assets.

Its political enemies smirk, thousands of small donors question the Amsterdam-based organisation&apos;s financial competence, and the folk who make a business of pointing out other people&apos;s faults are humbled and have to apologise. On the surface this seems like many other finance scandals, with a single person, a rogue trader, blamed for what is probably an institutional failure. But it raises other questions: was this bad luck or bad organisation? Should Greenpeace be indulging in high-risk trading? Was this financial speculation or hedging? Was it balancing risk or trying to profit from markets it little understood? Some context is needed: \u00a33m is a lot of money, especially when made up of the millions of small donations on which Greenpeace traditionally depends \u2013 but it is less than 1.5% of Greenpeace&apos;s turnover. The organisation may like to be seen as the brave underdog, but it employs 2,200 people, turns over about \u00a3200m a year worldwide and is just as much a multinational as the oil and chemical companies that it challenges in court or at sea. Its turnover may be less than the budgets of many oil company marketing departments, or the combined salaries of a few chief executives, but it is no political or financial ingenue. Greenpeace&apos;s growing size makes it more effective worldwide, but it also makes it harder for people to sympathise when it gets it wrong. The \u00a33m loss also hides the fact that even without its rogue trader the group lost money last year. The recession has been particularly hard for international charities, who are increasingly constricted by governments and have had to cut staff, reduce salaries and retract, thanks largely to the greed of bankers and financial institutions who plunged whole economies into crisis with their risk-taking. The irony is that it is really only the international environment and development groups such as Greenpeace, Oxfam, FoE International, Third World Network and WDM that are challenging rich governments&apos; ideological reliance on volatile and risky markets to provide the money promised for poor countries to adapt to climate change, redress deforestation and avoid ecological disaster. It hurts when Greenpeace loses the widows&apos; mite, but it will be nowhere near as painful as when countries such as Bangladesh or the Maldives are told there is no money in the Green Climate Fund, the IMF or the World Bank to build defences against rising sea levels or storm surges because anonymous rogue traders and trusted financiers in New York or London have misjudged the market and lost billions.

The Prince It&apos;s 1979 and &quot;an earthquake is erupting&quot;, but not in Jamaica&apos;s legendary Orange Street. The locus for this particular tectonic upheaval is north London, where Madness, a local sextet that is soon to become a septet with the addition of dancer/singer/trumpeter Cathal &quot;Chas Smash&quot; Smyth, have just cut their debut single at cubbyhole Pathway Studios for a mere \u00a3200. Showcasing their homegrown interpretation of ska, the upbeat Jamaican pop particularly loved by lead singer Graham &quot;Suggs&quot; McPherson, the band&apos;s first single is a joyous carnival of squawking sax, rollercoaster keys, lurching rhythm and a guitar hook that sounds like a car backfiring \u2013 all in tribute to ska pioneer Prince Buster, whose 1963 song Madness gave the band their name (and The Prince its B-side). Released on 2 Tone, the label run by Jerry Dammers of kindred spirits the Specials, The Prince was an instant hit, and soon found the Nutty Boys making the first of many appearances on Top of the Pops. 2. My Girl The band&apos;s debut album, One Step Beyond, followed in swift measure, cementing Madness\u2019s ska credentials with its titular lead single \u2013 which opened with Smash\u2019s legendary call to arms (and feet) on behalf of their &quot;heavy, heavy monster sound\u201d before taking another Prince Buster tune for a tumble on their bouncy castle. The LP\u2019s other tracks reflected the more eclectic jumble of the group&apos;s inspired live act, from affectionate rock\u2019n\u2019roll pastiche and Egyptian exotica to eccentric vaudevillian storytelling and more thoughtful, sophisticated fare such as My Girl. Written and originally sung by keyboard player Mike Barson, My Girl was no retread of the old Motown classic, but a kitchen-sink tale of heartache and misunderstanding that played out like Robert Wyatt scoring The Likely Lads, with Suggs singing glumly of hour-long phone calls to his girlfriend that are packed with mardy silence, and his need to \u201cstay in and watch TV on my own every now and then\u201d. Affecting and honest, it was an early sign that there was more to Madness than wacky videos and hopscotch ska. 3. Embarrassment Their early following included a strong skinhead contingent \u2013 common among all the 2 Tone groups \u2013 that saw Madness facing unfounded accusations of affiliating with racists. It was exacerbated by naive comments Chas Smash made during an interview with NME, which he responded to on the pointed Don\u2019t Quote Me on That. The second single off their second LP, Absolutely \u2013 and a distinct tonal shift from the naughty schoolboys romp of lead single Baggy Trousers \u2013 Embarrassment offered a subtle but powerful repudiation of racism and ignorance. Lee Thompson wove reactions from more bigoted members of his family to news that his sister was to have a mixed-race baby into a storming anthem of alienation, as the song\u2019s protagonist is scolded for being \u201ca disgrace to the human race\u201d. Set to Barson\u2019s downbeat honky-tonk piano and Thompson\u2019s scowling sax, Embarrassment made genius pop of such weighty material. 4. A Day on the Town The Nutty business was doing so well by 1981 that Madness relocated to Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas to record their third album, 7. But while you can take the boys out of London, the album\u2019s closing track shows you can&apos;t take London out of the boys, and proved that home was still on their minds. A darkly comedic skank, A Day on the Town found Suggs taking unpaid bus rides to the capital for mischief and evocatively chronicling the delights of a summer\u2019s afternoon in London, as dodgy touts corral \u201cthe tourists into their traps/ Taking their money, the shirts off their backs\u201d. Invoking a little Ghost Town-style menace, Suggs\u2019s yell of \u201criots in London!\u201d signalled a turn into eerie, dubby waters, the song\u2019s coda reprising the doomy vibe of 7\u2019s masterly lead single, Grey Day. 5. It Must Be Love Dave Robinson, of the band&apos;s label, Stiff Records, had a profound influence on his charges, directing many of their early iconic music videos and their witty, low-budget biopic, Take It or Leave It. Robinson badgered the reluctant band into committing this cover of the Labi Siffre ballad \u2013 a concert favourite \u2013 to vinyl. The delicate pizzicato strings, arranged by producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, were a testament to Madness\u2019 fast-growing sophistication, while Suggs\u2019s deftly underplayed vocals lent the more flowery parts of the lyrics an earthy, moving honesty. Exactly a decade after the release of Siffre\u2019s original, It Must Be Love reached No 4 in the UK charts (it also went top 40 in the US), to the relief of Robinson, who had promised to sign over ownership of Stiff Records to the group if the single wasn\u2019t a hit. Months later, his insistence that another Madness demo, The Chemist Facade, needed a chorus before it could be released as a single led to the group\u2019s first chart-topper, House of Fun.        6. Our House In the liner notes for the 1986 singles compilation, Utter Madness, Chas Smash \u2013 now known as Carl Smyth \u2013 recalled that the roots for Our House lay in his idea that each member should write a song about their family backgrounds, \u201cas all our families were so different. No one else bothered. I did.\u201d Written in that familiar Nutty voice \u2013 a mixture of warm nostalgia, affectionate wit and subtle pathos \u2013 Our House was a homely portrait of Smyth\u2019s youth, with father, mother, sisters and brothers all cramped in one chaotic abode, love and mischief abiding, and a bittersweet middle eight suggesting those familial ties might not always bind. It\u2019s the kind of unpatronising portrait of working-class life that pop music doesn\u2019t seem to deliver any more, though its sentiments \u2013 not to mention the swooning strings, Barson\u2019s barrelhouse piano chords and Chris Foreman\u2019s twangy guitar \u2013 gave Our House enough universal appeal to score the group their only top 10 hit in the US. It was later spun off into a stage musical. 7. The Sun and the Rain This selection draws heavily from the band&apos;s faultless hits compilations, Complete Madness and Utter Madness. That is no slight on the group\u2019s album tracks, but a sign that the Nutty Boys are still perhaps England\u2019s greatest post-Beatles singles group. By their early-80s peak, their rate of production was enough to deliver regular non-album hits, including It Must Be Love, House of Fun, the infectiously ecstatic Wings of a Dove and this 1983 nugget. The Sun and the Rain was a tribute to precipitation, and what could be more English than that? Accompanied by an urgent, string-laden stomp, Suggs sang of \u201cstanding up in the falling down\u201d, while Barson\u2019s drolly hammered away with glee on a honky-tonk piano. 8. One Better Day As the 80s wore on and the policies of the Thatcher government bit, the band found it hard to play the nutty clowns of yore and said they needed to write about what was happening to Britain. One song from this time, Victoria Gardens \u2013 which bleakly essayed the homeless community in London\u2019s \u201ccardboard city land\u201d, taking explicit aim at Thatcher with the arch \u201cshe said it\u2019s for the good of us all\u201d \u2013 was planned as a single from 1984\u2019s Keep Moving, but was nixed in favour of this more moving take on the subject. Suggs sang of a homeless man and woman who find love in the street. The song\u2019s power comes from how the grim realities of the verse blossom into the chorus\u2019 rich romance, like something out of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s City Lights: \u201cWalking round you sometimes/ Hear that sunshine/ Beating down in time with the rhythm of your shoes.\u201d The accompanying video saw Suggs and his wife, singer Bette Bright, play the song\u2019s protagonists, dancing with their carrier bags in front of Arlington House, a Camden Town hostel for homeless people. 9. Drip Fed Fred Barson left the band following Keep Moving and moved to Amsterdam. Despite gems like the old-before-their-years melancholia of Yesterday\u2019s Men, the cherishable Tears You Can\u2019t Hide and a charming cover of Scritti Politti\u2019s Sweetest Girl, the remaining members felt little affection for their 1985 Barsonless effort Mad Not Mad, while a subsequent album in 1988 as the Madness (now minus the rhythm section of Daniel Woodgate and Mark Bedford) did little to arrest the decline, and the group broke up. In 1992, however, they re-formed for the Madstock gigs in London&apos;s Finsbury Park \u2013 which, infamously, caused an actual earthquake in north London \u2013 and seven years later they returned to the studio, with Barson, for Wonderful. That rarest of things \u2013 a reunion album worthy of the legend \u2013 Wonderful maintained Madness\u2019s proprietary blend of the lunatic and the earthbound, with lead single Lovestruck weaving addictive, affecting pop from alcoholism. But the highlight was when Suggs handed the microphone to Ian Dury, a huge influence on the band. Dury played a cockney hoodlum making his claim for the throne of the London underworld to the sound of a fairground ska lurch. It would be his final recording before he died in 2000. 10. The Liberty of Norton Folgate Madness\u2019 ninth album, The Liberty of Norton Folgate, was greeted by &quot;best-of-their-career&quot; accolades on its release in 2009. The praise wasn\u2019t a respectful doffing of the cap to venerated national treasures. A loosely conceptual work immersed in the kind of vaudevillian London milieu in which Suggs had grown up, and rhapsodising the capital city, Norton Folgate was a lesson in how ambition need not suffocate a band\u2019s innate playful tunefulness, and, what\u2019s more, how a band so rooted in the joyful anarchy of youth could glide successfully into maturity without losing the very qualities that made them precious. Perhaps the peak of the remarkable second act of Madness\u2019 career (though last year\u2019s Oui Oui Si Si Ja Ja Da Da was also a keeper), Norton Folgate\u2019s literate, lunatic sprawl was introduced by this 10-minute overture, a fine introduction to the larger body of work. If you ever loved a Madness tune (and shame on you if you haven&apos;t), you need to hear it.

Productions of Manon Lescaut may not be as rare as that might suggest \u2013 Jonathan Kent&apos;s version follows one at Welsh National Opera earlier in the year \u2013 but like La Fanciulla del West, it&apos;s still a piece that&apos;s closer to the edge than the core of the standard repertory. Musically, Covent Garden has done the work proud, and the quality of the performance is defined in the pit. Antonio Pappano has few peers today as a Puccini conductor, and gives the score a tremendous sense of vivid theatricality; the energy he injects into the finale of the second act is irresistible, while the following orchestral intermezzo, surely the world of Wagner&apos;s Tristan heard through Puccini&apos;s ears, is firmly fixed as the opera&apos;s emotional heart.      'Exceptional singing' ... Kristine Opolais and Jonas Kaufmann. Photograph: Bill Cooper/ROH    The cast could hardly fail to respond to such encouragement, and after a slightly subfusc start, all of them did. Kristine Opolais manages Manon&apos;s transformation from good-time girl to tragic victim wonderfully well, using silvery pianissimos to marvellous effect, and while Jonas Kaufmann may not be the most vulnerable or moving Des Grieux - he is a bit too confident and self-contained for that - his singing, which seems to gain in weight and richness every time he appears here, is exceptional. As Lescaut, Christopher Maltman has just the right mix of cunning and charm; Maurizio Muraro is the insidiously predatory Geronte.  Kent&apos;s production, though, is less convincing. The designs, by Paul Brown, bring the action up to the present day, to a world of wheelie bins and people-carriers; the inn in Amiens becomes a bouncer-guarded gaming club, Geronte&apos;s Paris house takes on the lurid kitsch of the red-light district of Amsterdam or Hamburg as Manon entertains a row of elderly men with a film crew on hand to record her gyrations. The parade of deportees at Le Havre becomes a reality TV show, with ship&apos;s captain a tuxedoed emcee, while the last act takes place on a crumbling motorway bridge, literally a road to nowhere.

But walk inside and the soaring entrance lobby doubles as an elegant cocktail bar, and on the first floor, a smart restaurant offers creative local cuisine with dishes like duck breast with sour cherry and rhubarb sauce or roasted goose liver on a ragout of apricots and apple. By July, a brand new elevator will open just by the L\u00e1nch\u00edd to whisk visitors straight up to the Royal Castle, while a romantic walk across the grandiose Chain Bridge brings you straight into downtown Pest. Rooms have been decorated by local artists and graphic designers, many have big bathtubs, but if you want a panoramic view over the Danube rather than looking out over the Castle at the back, then that will add \u00a320 a night to the bill.\u2022 L\u00e1nch\u00edd utca 19, +36 1 457 1200, lanchid19hotel.hu, double rooms from \u00a367 not including breakfast Hotel Palazzo Zichy     Photograph: John Brunton    As you walk into the imposing marble entrance hall of the Palazzo Zichy it seems that little has changed since it was built in the 19th century for an Hungarian nobleman. But this is an hotel that mixes ancient with modern, and the reception lobby, in comparison, looks almost space-age, with a vast glass ceiling above and an open view on to the breakfast room a floor below. As is often the case in Budapest, the standard rooms are large, including the bathrooms, that have walk-in showers. Guests have free use of the sauna and fitness room, while during the day, free tea, coffee and snacks are served in the lounge bar.

A generous buffet breakfast is served in a striking orange and green dining room, and there&apos;s a popular lounge bar for hanging out before hitting the town&apos;s nightlife.

Eventually you reach the city&apos;s latest hotspot, Baltaz\u00e1r, a winebar and bistro on the ground floor, with 11 rooms upstairs that opened in July 2013. Each room is individually-themed, with decor inspired by Warhol and Keith Haring alongside vintage furniture and comfy leather armchairs. The restaurant specialises in charcoal grill cooking, and is the perfect place to discover Hungary&apos;s surprising wines, such as the crisp white Furmint or pinot noir from Transylvania.

The cafe covers the first floor of an imposing 1890s town house, and there is a separate side entrance to the 19 guestrooms, which are set off a wonderful winding art nouveau staircase that leads up to the attic.

While the exterior of the Mirage harks back to another era, the interiors have been renovated and modernised.

Guests are first shown around the high-ceilinged communal areas; a breakfast room, two huge lounges with one-off furniture pieces and lighting created by the Brody&apos;s in-house designers, sculptures and avant-garde paintings by artists-in-residence, and an honesty bar with wine, beer and a do-it-yourself cocktail kit. You have to go back down to the ground floor and cross a courtyard to the back of the building to access the guestrooms, which are just as quirky, where you may find a bathtub standing by the bed or a wall stripped back to bare bricks. Now the owners have opened up another cavernous house on the other side of town as the Brody Studios (V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty utca 38), a private-members club which includes a restaurant, bar, art events and late-night partying at the weekend, and those staying at Brody House get complimentary membership.\u2022 Br\u00f3dy S\u00e1ndor utca 10, +36 1 266 1211, brodyhouse.com, double room from \u00a374 not including breakfast Hotel Casati     hotograph: John Brunton    The Casati describes itself as an art hotel, beginning the moment you pass beneath a giant hanging sculpture dominating the entrance, while sitting in the cocktail bar is like being part of a multi-coloured gallery installation.

I wasn&apos;t aware of the book until I was auditioning for it, but yes I read it before I auditioned.  How affected were you by the book?I was very affected. I cried a bunch. I really, really liked it. When I read it I didn&apos;t see myself as Gus\u2026 yet, which is a good thing. I think that when you first read material or you first read a script or story and know you might be playing a part it&apos;s important not to see yourself because it should be a challenge enough that it doesn&apos;t come easy. I think Gus was always going to be a challenge and that&apos;s important. Characters I want to play are challenges to me. How much of you is in your portrayal of Gus?There are aspects of myself. I think Gus is very theatrical, and over the top and I do that as well. I have an aura of theatricality but at the same time Gus is a regular guy, he&apos;s vulnerable and he&apos;s sensitive and so am I underneath it all, that&apos;s what makes him real. Any real person has a front and a real part to themselves.     Falling more deeply in love in Amsterdam: Gus (Ansel Elgort) and Hazel (Shailene Woodley) Photograph: 20th Century Fox    Were you nervous taking on the role of Augustus knowing there is such a strong fan base for the book and readers have such a strong image of the character in their heads?Yeah a little definitely. Because of fans but also because of me because he&apos;s a tough character to bring to life, he&apos;s very complex. Also fans definitely have an expectation of this guy, people are in love with Gus and I didn&apos;t want to mess that up, I wanted to bring him to life the way people had imagined him. Did the expectations of The Fault in Our Stars fans affect you or even intimidate you in any way?A little bit, but it&apos;s healthy to find it intimidating. But at the same time once I was on set I didn&apos;t think, oh I should do this or I shouldn&apos;t do that because the fans might think it&apos;s bad. John Green who wrote the book was also there on set a lot so he made us all feel more comfortable because if he liked something we knew that you guys would like it.  What was it like to work with John Green? And how involved was he in making the film?It was great to have him around. First of all John is an awesome person he&apos;s one of my good friends now and in terms of involvement a movie isn&apos;t made by a writer ever, but he was a co-producer on it which means he gave his support. The screen writers were Michael Weber and Scott Neustadter, who also wrote the famous movie 500 Days of Summer. They did a great job of adapting the book. I think one of the things that is so great about the movie is it is so close to the book. If it wasn&apos;t that would be sad because the book is so good already. It&apos;s about preserving the tone and the feeling of it; I knew if they could do that in the movie version the movie would be a success and it is.  What did you think about how the movie turned out? Did it meet your expectations? Yes definitely. I&apos;m very, very happy with the way it turns out. I knew it could be this good, but you never know until you see it. What would you say was the most challenging scene to film?Well for me there are a few very emotional scenes which are tough. The scene at the gas station was very tough for me, very emotional and difficult having to go to that emotional place. Sometimes there&apos;s pressure because you think &quot;oh no if I can&apos;t do it, this is going to suck&quot;. I am happy with how it turned out but it&apos;s definitely a challenge. The most challenging part of becoming Gus was capturing his theatricality but then also how he breaks down and becomes the vulnerable boy. Did you have to meet any teens who had cancer to understand Gus&apos;s character better?We did spend time with kids who did have cancer or had had it. And all the kids in the support group in the film are real kids with cancer, they weren&apos;t extras. That was really interesting having them there. But the thing about this story, and the way it represents cancer which means it so special, is that the way John writes it is they are regular kids who happen to have cancer. You wouldn&apos;t even know the kids in the film had cancer if I hadn&apos;t told you, they are not their disease, they don&apos;t let their disease become them. And that&apos;s how I wanted to approach Gus and how Shailene wanted approach Hazel because we knew people don&apos;t love this book because it&apos;s a story about cancer \u2013 they love it because it&apos;s a love story and that&apos;s the most important thing. What is the one thing you want fans to take away from this film?I want people to take away hope from this movie. Nat who plays Issac said someone came up to him after the movie and said I want to call everyone who I love and tell them I love them. That&apos;s the message: to appreciate what&apos;s in front of you. The love that you have or the people in your life. Also Gus&apos;s challenge is he wants to be remembered. Then he learns at the end that that&apos;s not the most important thing. Hazel is worried about what&apos;s going to happen to people after she dies but she realises that they&apos;ll go on, they&apos;ll live with pain but they&apos;ll survive and that&apos;s OK. Don&apos;t worry about that. I think that&apos;s a challenge all of us go through, whether it&apos;s a parent knowing they are going to have to die and leave their kids behind or it&apos;s a young person saying I haven&apos;t left my mark yet, I lived for no reason \u2013 but that&apos;s a stupid way of thinking because as Hazel says in the book there will come a day when Mozart isn&apos;t remembered so don&apos;t worry about it! What was your favourite book when you were growing up? Did you have a book that made a real impact on you like The Fault in Our Stars has on so many people?I&apos;m only 20 so still in the bracket for The Fault in Our Stars, and that&apos;s had a big impact. But for me it was more movies that influenced me, particularly On the Waterfront and East of Eden. In On the Waterfront Marlon Brando&apos;s character is a boxer and he&apos;s brought down by his family and he ends up not living the life he could have but at the end of the movie he ends up standing up for himself. I love that movie. East of Eden is an important story for me. It&apos;s about a kid that&apos;s misunderstood and feels like he&apos;s not loved by his father. It&apos;s a very father-son kind of story and it&apos;s not until the end that they sort of make up. I like that because every boy has trouble with his father so it&apos;s very relatable. Did you want to be an actor when you were growing up?Yeah and it&apos;s those movies that made me want to be an actor, ones that told special and important stories that made you think and learn about life before you need to do it.  Was it at all weird going from being Shailene Woodley&apos;s sibling in Divergent to her boyfriend in TFIOS?No it really wasn&apos;t because we became close on Divergent which was important and helpful because then when we came to do this movie we were comfortable with each other. And the friendship you see between Gus and Hazel, which in it&apos;s real love is friendship, when you see that, it&apos;s real. Me and Shailene are very close in real life. After Shailene&apos;s announcement that she&apos;s done with making teen films, do you think you&apos;ll stop anytime soon?For her she was saying this is probably the last time she&apos;ll play a teenager; that&apos;s a big chapter of an actor&apos;s life but there comes a point when you are too old for it. Hopefully I&apos;m not going to play anyone younger than 18 from now on and after that I&apos;ll be playing parts in their 20s.      Being interviewed for the Guardian children's and teens' books site, this thumbs up is for the members! Photograph: Emily Drabble    If you could live as any one book character for a day, who would it be and why?Guys I&apos;m a bad example: you should all read, but I&apos;m such a film guy, I watch films all the time. But my favourite movies are The Lord of the Rings and they are also books, so that works. I haven&apos;t read the books but I NEED to and I will. I&apos;d like to be Gandalf for a day he&apos;s so wise, he&apos;s so powerful and he&apos;s so caring. I love Gandalf. When they remake Lord of The Rings maybe I&apos;ll play it.  Would you really be so interested in reading a book like An Imperial Affliction and would actually use your wish to meet an author in real life? If John Green wrote An Imperial Affliction I&apos;d read it. I don&apos;t think he ever will. I would use my last wish to meet him. And if you guys have a last wish you should use it to meet him, he&apos;s awesome. I need to read his other books, I&apos;ll probably start with Looking For Alaska h and then Paper Towns. It&apos;s being made into a movie and I&apos;ll probably be in it!  What is one thing you are passionate about other than acting?Music right now. I produce electric music or house music under the name Ans\u00f8lo. Actually while I&apos;m working on a film I do the most work as I end up being alone in a city, and my downtime I spend on the computer making music.  Do you find yourself saying &quot;OK&quot; a lot more since playing Gus?I say it as much as anyone else I guess, but now when I say it I catch myself and say &apos;that&apos;s funny I just said &quot;OK&quot;&apos;.

And I realised that it\u2019s more important to be surrounded by the people you love than the things you own.\u201d It got him thinking: why does everyone feel the need to purchase their own private set of consumer items \u2013 a hammer, a tent, a badminton racket \u2013 that everyone else has, and that lie unused most of the time? Why not encourage people to share stuff with each other, the way neighbours once did before cities made us more anonymous? He turned the idea into the sharing service Peerby, which just won Weddepohl that oversized cheque at the AppMyCity competiton for best urban app, held as part of the New Cities Summit in Dallas, Texas. The app is simple: Peerby users can send out a request for an item they want to borrow. Other users are notified of the requests near them, and can accept if they feel like sharing \u2013 a kind of temporary freecycling. He opens Peerby on his iPhone to show me a map of his neighbourhood in Amsterdam: a sea of Peerby logos, with dozens of users on every street. \u201cI want every city to become a sharing city,\u201d he says. That sentiment was heard frequently in the Winspear Opera House over the last couple of days, as corporations, consultants and mayors met in the 35-degree Texas heat to join in singing the praises of, among other things, the shared economy. Airbnb and Uber are just the highest-profile of these new technology-enabled services. One of the runners up to Peerby was Djump, a \u201csocial ridesharing\u201d service that acts something like a hitch-hiking app. The third finalist from the 90-plus applicants was Social Cyclist, an app that allows users to share cycling routes and information with each other and with their local governments. Proponents of the shared economy can sometimes be guilty of an arrogant evangelism about the superiority of their peer-to-peer business models, which are for the most part taking advantage of a grey space that is lightly regulated or taxed. But unlike Airbnb or Uber, which take explicit aim at breaking into specific industries, Djump and Peerby are non-monetised apps that simply make it easier for city people to do what small-town folk have always done: hitch a ride, borrow some sugar. Weddepohl makes the point that sharing involves not just less waste but more social interaction. It\u2019s a lesson he had to learn by fire. \u201cThere\u2019s a word for [the experience I went through] in Dutch that doesn\u2019t really have an English equivalent: gunnen,\u201d he says, as a stream of people stop by congratulate him, shake his hand and slip business cards into his pocket. \u201cIt means I wouldn\u2019t force it on anyone, but I\u2019d recommend it to them.\u201d", "sentences": ["He opens Peerby on his iPhone to show me a map of his neighbourhood in Amsterdam: a sea of Peerby logos, with dozens of users on every street."], "title": "AppMyCity winner Peerby brings small-town sharing to big city life", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/19/appmycity-winner-peerby-brings-small-town-sharing-to-big-city-life", "tags": ["Cities", "City apps", "Apps", "Technology", "Netherlands"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-19T14:00:00Z", "article": " \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nYou have to admire the brutal efficiency in this emotional teen movie, based on the colossal young adult bestseller by John Green, which for the most part enforces the silver ring of abstinence with cancer. You have to concede the laser-guided accuracy and psychotic vehemence with which it goes for the tear duct. It's like being mugged by a professional whose skills in mixed martial arts you can't help but notice and appreciate, even as you are savagely beaten, then dragged upright, bruised and bleeding, and forced to watch as your assailant gives&nbsp;fully 45%&nbsp;of your money to&nbsp;charity. \nShailene Woodley (from Divergent, and Alexander Payne's The Descendants) plays Hazel, a teenage cancer patient, whose thyroid lesions have metastasised to her lungs; her condition, once gravely critical, has stabilised due to experimental drug treatment, but she has to wheel around a portable oxygen tank, a lite-tragical accessory. In the support group that her mom (Laura Dern) forces her to attend, Hazel catches the eye of Gus (Ansel Elgort), a cute boy, whose osteosarcoma condition is also stabilised after the amputation of one&nbsp;leg, although this is&nbsp;mostly concealed under his jeans. \nThey are as rich and attractive as teens in a Nancy Meyers movie, with a&nbsp;quirky, smart, back-talking relationship. Life-affirming Gus likes to have an unlit cigarette in his mouth to show his existential defiance. Despite being such an obvious hottie, Gus is a virgin. Hazel's own condition in this respect is&nbsp;apparently so self-evident that she never says it out loud. It is all too clearly Gus's virginity, not his cancer, which is his heartbreaking vulnerability, like Rochester getting to be blind at the beginning and not the end of Jane Eyre. \"You two are so adorable,\" says Hazel's mother, out loud, without anyone nearby screaming. \nHazel is obsessed with a novel called An Imperial Affliction with a bafflingly abrupt ending, all about a girl dying of cancer, written by a reclusive author called Peter van Houten. (The title may have been inspired by Siddhartha Mukherjee's Pulitzer-winning study The Emperor of All Maladies: A&nbsp;Biography of Cancer.) Impulsive, entrancing Gus whisks her and her mom off to Amsterdam to meet her hero, and it is a journey that is to bring their relationship to a crisis. \nNow, there may be people who can witness a halfway competent dramatic representation of the death of children from cancer without choking up. I am not among them \u2013 and it was the same before I became a parent. But through the occasional mist of tears, the essential phoney-baloniness of this film looked even worse. Woodley is&nbsp;very good, no doubt about it. What might this talented young star achieve if she were in a film which was not fantastically manipulative and crass? \nFlashbacks show that Woodley's character lost her hair when she was 12. It has thankfully grown back, but she is wearing it austerely short. Gus is way cute, and his lifestyle, like Hazel's, does not appear to be modified in any appreciable way by his illness. They are both extremely comfortably off, and Gus's bedroom is like a starter man-cave for a wealthy and obnoxious young man \u2013 so ostentatious, in fact, that I assumed some learning experience, some comeuppance, was&nbsp;coming his way. \nBut no. Their respective parents are also in this too-good-to-be-true bracket, although Hazel's mom appears to have whispered something extraordinary to Hazel, when she was in a grave situation in&nbsp;hospital years previously. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;something that Hazel has not forgotten and that should theoretically deepen and complicate their relationship profoundly. But the&nbsp;pair just hug it out. It's like it&nbsp;never&nbsp;happened. \nThe Fault in Our Stars reaches a&nbsp;nadir of horror when Hazel and Gus visit the Anne Frank House. The couple are overwhelmed with emotion at their own situation and make out, while the surrounding crowd melt with romcom bliss, offering encouragement in various European languages. The Pont des Arts in Paris is becoming choked with padlocks affixed by lovers. Maybe&nbsp;now there will be a nonstop traffic jam of sad snogging teens in&nbsp;Anne Frank's bedroom. \nThe title is taken from Cassius in&nbsp;Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: \"The&nbsp;fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars/ But in ourselves, that we are underlings.\" Perhaps getting cancer was written in the stars for them, but Hazel and Gus realise that it is \"in themselves\" to do something in response, up to them to make the best of life. That's fair enough. And perhaps therapeutic escapism is the point of The Fault in Our Stars \u2013 although Hazel&nbsp;claims that it is the real thing. This prettified cancer fantasy comes nowhere near. \n\u2022 Watch a video review of The Fault in Our Stars", "sentences": ["Impulsive, entrancing Gus whisks her and her mom off to Amsterdam to meet her hero, and it is a journey that is to bring their relationship to a crisis."], "title": "The Fault in our Stars review \u2013 manipulative and crass", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/19/fault-in-our-stars-review-john-green", "tags": ["The Fault in Our Stars", "Film", "John Green", "Books", "Fiction", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-19T14:31:00Z", "article": "Anyone looking for a neat summation of S\u00e3o Paulo life would struggle to beat the words of up-and-coming rapper Don L. &quot;In S\u00e3o Paulo, every day is a Monday,&quot; he says, referencing the stressed-out, workaholic existence that makes living in Brazil&apos;s biggest city a tough grind. &quot;But every night is a Friday.&quot; S\u00e3o Paulo might not be the prettiest place to look at \u2013 from the 42nd floor of the Edificio Italia you can see rows of graffiti-strewn towerblocks stretching to the horizon in every direction \u2013 but its treasures are revealed once the clock strikes midnight and the famous Brazilian party spirit is unleashed across the city&apos;s venues, clubs and street parties. Over the past year, this party spirit has been one of the few things Paulistanos have left to cling on to. Their city has been in the news regularly, not just because of the World Cup (Brazil kicked off the competition here last week), but also because of the protests that have broken out in the city against it, themselves an extension of the widespread unrest that hit S\u00e3o Paulo a year ago, with transport, education, healthcare, legalisation of marijuana and corruption (pretty much everything, then) on the agenda. It would be easy to think of the city&apos;s music scene as offering an escape from such woes. But after spending five days in the city talking to local musicians \u2013 from experimental synth artists to rappers from the city&apos;s favelas \u2013 it becomes clear that the protests and the latest sounds are often tied up together.            &quot;There are big infrastructure problems here and all over the country,&quot; says Sombra, a rapper from the poor S\u00e3o Paulo suburb of Guarulhos, known for his unique flow and ironic sense of humour. &quot;But that just inspires me to articulate whatever is needed.&quot; Bruno Morais, a shy record obsessive whose gentle instrumental compositions can best be heard on 2012&apos;s A Vontade Superstar, agrees: &quot;The fact the World Cup is happening right now is completely wrong,&quot; he tells me as he walks me around his favourite downtown record store to marvel at the rare Jorge Ben Jor vinyl on the walls. Yet rather than addressing their concerns directly through lyrics - as the 70s generation of Brazilian musicians did - Morais believes that the new wave of artists are voicing their anger by pushing things artisticallyand forcing themselves to think outside the box.     Red Bull Station. Photograph: Red Bull    He&apos;s talking about local artists such as Met\u00e1 Met\u00e1 \u2013 a trio who mix traditional Brazilian music with, among other things, freeform jazz \u2013 and Dudu Tsuda, who specialises in sound installations. Another is Rodrigo Coelho, who moved to S\u00e3o Paulo from Recife \u2013 &quot;the New Orleans of Brazil&quot; \u2013in order to &quot;build a bridge between the percussion associated with the Afro-Brazilian religion Candombl\u00e9 and the modular synths of Germany&quot;. His new label, UIVO, aims to promote a new kind of Brazilian music that will confound outsiders: &quot;A bit more gloomy, not so tropical,&quot; he says. &quot;There are a lot of fucked-up things happening in Brazil, but this makes you want to do something different, to prove yourself as people, as a country, to show we are not just dumb monkeys that get robbed all the time.&quot; One sign of the city&apos;s current cultural capital is the location I meet Coelho at: in the old downtown of S\u00e3o Paulo lies a newly opened Red Bull music studio (other studios of theirs have popped up in such musical hubs as London, New York and Los Angeles, as well as Madrid, Cape Town, Copenhagen, Paris, Auckland and Amsterdam). It offers free studio time to upcoming artists and recording time for local musicians \u2013 Coelho, a former Red Bull Music Academy graduate, is recording his latest project, Grassmass, there \u2013 and also hosts a range of classes for budding artists. On the day I visit, exciting new duo Tropkillaz are mentoring a session on bass music and trap \u2013 not something you would expect to find on your average music course \u2013 which involves 10 baseball-capped music-makers learning,during the exercise I sit in on, to deconstruct Di Melo&apos;s Brazilian funk soul classic A Vida Em Seus M\u00e9todos Diz Calma.     Tropkillaz. Photograph: www.redbullcontentpool.com    Tropkillaz are DJ Zegon, the hip-hop veteran from NASA who produced countless 90s Brazilian classics, and 21-year-old Laudz, who Zegon met on Twitter and liked his music so much that he ended up inviting him to his house to make beats for five days straight. This combination of youth and experience produces wild, trap-influenced dancefloor bangers with a Brazilian flavour. &quot;We do use a lot of Latin or Brazilian samples, but obscure ones \u2013 not samba or bossa nova,&quot; says Zegon. &quot;But even when we flip American or Japanese samples, our flow or rhythm shows the Brazilian element because it&apos;s the swing we&apos;ve got in our blood.&quot; Zegon references other Paulistanos making interesting bass music, from Flying Buff and Sugar Crush - who make trap and twerk music for the dancefloor \u2013 to the more abstract, instrumental bass sounds on the label Beatwise. He also tells me about the best nights in S\u00e3o Paulo, such as Monday&apos;s rock night On The Rocks or Tuesday&apos;s legendary hip-hop party Chocolate at Clash Club. It&apos;s the latter venue we head to the following night to hear a mix of Brazilian and US hip-hop and catch a fantastic 2am live performance by Karol Conka, one of several female MCs across Brazil, including Flora Matos \u2013 who raps about LGBT issues \u2013 and Rio trio Pearls Negras (check out their excellent baille-funk flavoured Pensando em Voc\u00ea). Backstage before her show, Conka says she expects to see more female MCs over the next year, as the scene is only just taking off. She also explains that, although the dire situation in Brazil affects her, she &quot;prefers to focus on the positive things, the solutions, such as self-esteem and respecting yourself&quot;. Despite not living in S\u00e3o Paulo, Conka says she comes here every month because it has a &quot;hot audience&quot; and you can see what she means: amazingly for a Tuesday night \u2013 and proof that every night really is a Friday in the city \u2013 Club Clash is packed with around 800 people all dancing until 5am, aided no doubt by the impressive measures being served at the bar. Early the next day (and yes, somehow you are expected to have a &quot;day&quot; here, despite being out until 5am), I get a calmer view of the music scene when I head to the arty area of Vila Madalena to see S\u00e3o Paulo&apos;s DIY indie scene in action. On a sleepy street (or at least what counts for one here), Gui Jesus Toledo has turned an old garage into a studio in which seven bands loosely grouped together (they&apos;re linked through friendship and youth rather than genre) congregate to record and release records through their shared label Risco.Toledo \u2013 who spent five months building the studio and admits that it&apos;s not soundproofed quite well enough to avoid waking his neighbours up - says &quot;every band here is like a mini universe, with a distribution model that works for them&quot;. One of these bands is O Terno, a young rock&apos;n&apos;roll trio inspired by Os Mutantes and 60s rock groups such as Cream. Tim Bernardes, the group&apos;s 22-year-old singer, says that although O Terno&apos;s new album was mainly composed before the protests of last June, the anger that movement generated now comes through &quot;in the way we play \u2013 more direct, more intense!&quot; It&apos;s something backed up by Curumin, a funk, samba and hip-hop influenced artist, who says he detects that the new music being made &quot;has more anger, is more tense, touches the wound more deeply&quot;.     Pearls Negras. Photograph: PR     Of course, not everyone is convinced by this new wave of protest, especially on the hip-hop scene. Emicida is one of the country&apos;s biggests stars, a rapper whose name refers to his killer instincts in MC battles (events that still take place on the city&apos;s streets). As he puts it: &quot;Rap has always been concerned about these issues \u2026 people were talking about them way before the protests. If someone was to change their music because of them then that, to me, would be an opportunist attitude.&quot; Maybe as a reaction to what he perceives to be bandwagon-jumping, one of Emicida&apos;s most recent releases was a collaboration with MC Guime, a young funk singer who shares his favela background but rejected Brazilian hip-hop&apos;s lineage of socially conscious lyrics to sing about parties and owning expensive watches, a trend that the media has dubbed &quot;ostentation&quot;. Yet even Guime sees his music as having an important social purpose: &quot;My songs focus on fun, luxury items, but they always give the idea that the dream can be achieved,&quot; he says. Ultimately, the music of S\u00e3o Paulo is too diverse and ever-changing to be restricted to one school of thought. It&apos;s this diversity that makes it so thrilling as a music city, along with its plentiful venues, diverse ethnic makeup, active culture organisation, SESC, concrete jungle image and competitive rivalry with Rio de Janeiro (as Emicida tells me: &quot;S\u00e3o Paulo people think Rio people are lazy, Rio people think S\u00e3o Paulo people are workaholics&quot;). It&apos;s a city of contradictions that can be stomach-churning: while almost a third of its population live in slums, it boasts the world&apos;s highest number of helicopters per capita. Yet it&apos;s also a city that has learned to thrive on such contradictions. In the words of Dudu Tsuda: &quot;S\u00e3o Paulo is way too intense, way too big, way too violent, noisy, polluted and chaotic. But it is our inspiration.&quot; S\u00e3o Paulo artists on what makes their city so special DJ Zegon, Tropkillaz &quot;I was around for the first generation of DJs and B-Boys in S\u00e3o Paulo, around 1986/87. I was a professional skateboarder and we used to skate the same spots that the B-Boys used to breakdance in, downtown or in Park Ibirapuera. We&apos;d hear punk rock, hardcore, hip-hop ... all kinds of styles that would crossover. I was a good skater but I was always breaking a bone somewhere, so when I first heard a DJ scratching I thought: &apos;That&apos;s what I want to do!&apos; S\u00e3o Paulo is a city that never stops. I lived in Rio for a bit and it was easy to get distracted but here we have no distractions other than work, work, work! I work all day, then go to sleep and dream about making music!&quot; Barbara Eugenia &quot;S\u00e3o Paulo is a big melting pot, having people from all over (especially from other parts of Brazil, being so rich and multicultural), which gives us the possibility to create in a more diverse manner. There are great artists here like Peri Pane \u2013 a composer and cello player who mixes music and poetry in a beautiful way \u2013 and Tat\u00e1 Aeroplano, who I think will one day be known as on of the most important artists from S\u00e3o Paulo. He&apos;s a fantastic chronicler, telling stories of the city so uniquely.&quot;     Emicida. Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba    Emicida &quot;I grew up far away from the centre of S\u00e3o Paulo so I would always find out about new music through tapes and VHS cassettes \u2013 I would always hear stories that I did not experience myself. Back in the day things were much harder in the hip-hop scene \u2013 prejudice was much higher, so I&apos;m glad to have had those guys open the way for me. The favela \u2013 where I&apos;m from \u2013 identifies with the music because it talks about the life in there. Even if it&apos;s about dreams, it&apos;s about their dreams.&quot; Bruno Morais &quot;I moved to S\u00e3o Paulo because I needed to show people the music I&apos;d recorded and there is a lot of space here \u2013 venues, rehearsal rooms - to do that. There&apos;s also SESC here, which is a private/public institution with a strong cultural presence in S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 they give room to a lot of arts performers, mainly music. It gives indie artists a place to perform.&quot; Curumin &quot;S\u00e3o Paulo is a huge city where the best ways of leisure are the cultural events. If you play a hermetic kind of music genre, in S\u00e3o Paulo you find an audience and a place to play it. I used to walk around the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo by myself because I loved music and there were always free concerts. I saw Hermeto Pascoal, Baden Powell, Tom Jobim, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil ... there were also parties \u2013 soul, hip-hop, samba \u2013 which inspired me. It may seem hard to find S\u00e3o Paulo &apos;inspiring&apos;, but my uncle \u2013 an important photographer called Cristiano Mascaro \u2013 has a phrase that defines the city well: S\u00e3o Paulo is not pretty, but it&apos;s very interesting.&quot; Felipe Cordeiro &quot;Because S\u00e3o Paulo is a city that has developed itself around work relations, it has a fast, imposing rhythm and style different to the rest of Brazil. I am interested in the vanguard music from S\u00e3o Paulo and in the underground that happened here in the beginning of the 80s. The contemporary Paulista generation are discovering &apos;new Brazils&apos;: new possibilities of being Brazilian and of doing Brazilian music.&quot; Dudu Tsuda &quot;S\u00e3o Paulo has a very dense and chaotic urban background that leads you to create something very aware of your surroundings. Artists here create things connected to their context, it is almost impossible to be out of it. Sometimes things here are made to be difficult and painful. Everything is disorganised, politicians are corrupted, there is no sense of common wealth, no sense of community, which makes your everyday life very complicated, and some cases, miserable. People here smile anyway. This is a miracle. And music is something between this spontaneous and miraculous smile and the feeling that things must change.&quot; Don L  &quot;I moved to S\u00e3o Paulo about six months ago, to help bring my career to the next level. The diversity attracted me: almost every genre is here in S\u00e3o Paulo and so you get people exchanging ideas. I remember when I performed at Chocolate and it got to midnight and it was quite quiet so I thought that meant nobody would turn up. Then after a while it was packed \u2013 on a Tuesday night! Every day there is something going on here. The most important art exhibitions come here first \u2013 there was a Miles Davis one which was beautiful \u2013 but now that I&apos;m here I can&apos;t find time to go because of the local rhythm of craziness.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;There are a lot of fucked-up things happening in Brazil, but this makes you want to do something different, to prove yourself as people, as a country, to show we are not just dumb monkeys that get robbed all the time.&quot; One sign of the city&apos;s current cultural capital is the location I meet Coelho at: in the old downtown of S\u00e3o Paulo lies a newly opened Red Bull music studio (other studios of theirs have popped up in such musical hubs as London, New York and Los Angeles, as well as Madrid, Cape Town, Copenhagen, Paris, Auckland and Amsterdam)."], "title": "S\u00e3o Paulo's music scene: 'Every day is Monday, every night is Friday'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/19/sao-paulo-every-day-monday-every-night-friday", "tags": ["Travel", "Culture", "Sao Paulo holidays", "South America holidays", "Football", "World Cup", "Music", "Brazil holidays", "World Cup 2014"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-20T15:23:13Z", "article": "The young woman painted by Johannes Vermeer in about 1665 has never looked better. Her perfect skin and lively eyes, as bright as her famous earring, are exquisitely lit as she parts her lips to say \u2013 what? The Girl with a Pearl Earring&apos;s wordless utterance hints at an erotic come-on that historians cannot explicate but novelists and filmmakers can&apos;t help guessing at. Was she Vermeer&apos;s lover? His obscure object of desire? Now this seductive painting in which Vermeer (usually such a restrained, cool, cautious artist) seems to indulge a secret passion, has a new, or rather reinvented, home. The masterpiece is better lit, better hung and more elegantly surrounded than ever before at the refurbished and modernised Mauritshuis in The Hague, which rivals Amsterdam&apos;s Rijksmuseum as the greatest collection of Dutch art in the world. If the Rijksmuseum is bigger, it is the Mauritshuis collection that owns some of the most iconic Dutch masterpieces, from The Girl with a Pearl Earring to The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius \u2013 yes, that goldfinch, the painting that inspired the recent bestseller by Donna Tartt whose main character is obsessed with this picture. Visitors flocked to an exhibition of highlights from the Mauritshuis in New York last year to see the bird that appears on the cover of the book.     Carel Fabritius's The Goldfinch, which drew crowds when it was exhibited in New York after it featured in Donna Tartt's novel.  Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP    Now the painting has its own fenced-off little display in The Hague as a celebrity painting \u2013 and what a brilliant work it is, the feathers of the goldfinch painted in broad, free, almost abstract dollops of colour. Yet however much glitz and glamour surrounds some of the paintings here, the Mauritshuis is above all a collection to lose yourself in, as you drift among the painted polders and anatomy theatres of the 17th-century Dutch Republic. The museum&apos;s refurbishment is dramatic and tasteful. It is clearly designed to turn a connoisseurs&apos;s collection into a pop destination, and it deserves to succeed at that. Its period treasure house of Dutch Golden Age art is now reached by a very modern approach. The new entrance is through a spacious underground lobby. One way leads to a stylish suite of cafes, shops and all the other facilities we expect nowadays. What does all this added modern swankery add to the art collection of the princes of Orange that is housed here? It gives the place a sense of occasion \u2013 and the cafe really is very nice.     The Hague's refurbished Mauritshuis museum: 'designed to turn a connoisseurs\u2019s collection into a pop destination'.  Photograph: Lex Van Lieshout/EPA    But once you proceed past the new architectural prologue into the collection&apos;s home in the 17th-century house of Prince Johan Maurits, now immaculately restored and relit, the silent world of painting takes over. Rembrandt gazes back from what is probably his last self-portrait, looking exhausted and broken but seeming to possess an unsettling wisdom that puts me in my place. Women lay out huge strips of linen to bleach in the sun in a painting by Jacob Ruisdael that astonishingly manages to show the whole landscape around Haarlem with the lofty precision of a satellite photograph. Dutch painters four centuries ago used experimental techniques that make their paintings precociously modern in our eyes. The brushwork of Frans Hals&apos;s Laughing Boy, painted in about 1625, is so casual and chaotic it seems almost drunken in its gleeful abandon. But most of all, these artists appear engrossed in a world of things. Working amid merchant wealth and the scientific revolution, they look relentlessly on reality, trying to fathom it. Paulus Potter portrays an enormous bull life size, in a giant canvas that teeters on surrealism. Traditionally, pictures this size were for recording battles. Potter gives historical scale to a farmer showing off a prize bull. Rembrandt looks that bit deeper. His Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp contains a trap for the eye. Looking at the attentive faces of the men watching Tulp&apos;s lesson, your gaze is led irresistibly to the gory skinned arm of the grey corpse whose sinews and bones the anatomist is describing. The eye is drawn into a dark tunnel between the arm&apos;s exposed muscles \u2013 and into the body itself. Rembrandt leads the onlooker from the visible world to the invisible darkness within. What lies there? You may as well ask what is going on inside all the houses of Delft whose sunlit rooftops Vermeer painted in about 1660 in his great View of Delft. Looking at his home town from its harbour, he ponders the image of the city gate reflected in still, deep waters. Clouds pregnant with rain or some other menace glide above. People meet on the shoreline, posed like dolls. Beyond the brick walls whose every detail Vermeer mirrors in shadowed and sunlit passages of mottled paint, beyond blank windows, a city is going about its business. People must be pouring milk, reading letters and pursuing girls with pearl earrings. But we can&apos;t see them. What is Vermeer&apos;s painting about?

In 1996, surgeons at the Wilford Hall medical centre in Texas working to separate a pair of conjoined twins thought that only one would be able to walk after the operation. After a model of the girls&apos; bone structure was generated using 3D printing, however, they found a shared upper leg bone to be bigger than expected and split it successfully, resulting in both twins being able to walk. Hull said: &quot;This is extremely difficult for surgeons, to figure out how they are going to separate the two twins so that you will have two separately living people. When some of those surgeries were first done using the help of our technology, it was really touching for me.&quot; Now 75 and still working as chief technology officer of 3D Systems, the company he co-founded, Hull is enjoying some minor celebrity 31 years after he first printed a small black eye-wash cup using a new method of manufacturing called stereolithography, now known as 3D printing. At the time, he was working for a company that used UV light to put thin layers of plastic veneers on tabletops and furniture. Like others within the industry, he was frustrated that the production of small plastic parts for prototyping new product designs could take up to two months. He had an idea that if he could place thousands of thin layers of plastic on top of each other and then etch their shape using light, he would be able to form three dimensional objects. After a year of tinkering with ideas in a backroom lab after hours, he developed a system where light was shone into a vat of photopolymer \u2013 a material which changes from liquid to plastic-like solid when light shines on it \u2013 and traces the shape of one level of the object. Subsequent layers are then printed until it is complete. After patenting the invention in 1986, he set up 3D Systems in order to commercialise the new method of production and went on the road to secure both funding \u2013 eventually getting $6m (\u00a33.5m) from a Canadian investor \u2013 and customers, using videotapes to show the equipment. The first commercial product came out in 1988 and proved a hit among car manufacturers, in the aerospace sector and for companies designing medical equipment. Soon General Motors and Mercedes-Benz were using 3D Systems&apos; technology \u2013 the company sold printers, materials and software \u2013 to build prototypes, but it was developments in medicine that stunned him, such as when models in advance of surgery could be created. &quot;That was just startling to me, that someone used the technology like that.&quot; When Hull originally came up with his invention, he told his wife that it would take between 25 and 30 years before the technology would find its way into the home. That prediction proved correct as the realistic prospect of widespread commercial 3D printers has only emerged in recent years. The possibilities appear endless \u2013 from home-printed food and pharmaceuticals to suggestions that pictures of ceramics will be able to be taken in shops and then recreated using plans downloaded from the internet. Hull, an unassuming man who has 93 patents to his name in the US and 20 in Europe, says he is &quot;humbled&quot; by the possibilities but stops short of predicting what his technology could eventually deliver, although he is confident printers could soon be in every home. &quot;It&apos;s nice to get some recognition, it was a lot of hard work but other than that I just keep working,&quot; he said last week in Berlin, where he received a European Inventor Award. Controversy has arisen with the possibility that guns will be able to be produced using 3D printing, again using blueprints downloaded from the internet. A group called Defense Distributed last year successfully tested a 3D printed gun in Texas. Hull said: &quot;My first thought is that people messing with that \u2013 I hope they don&apos;t hurt themselves. Building and testing guns of that nature could be dangerous. I think the people doing that were trying to make a point. &quot;I don&apos;t know that people are going to be printing guns around the world but in any case our company, we are not the government or the police agencies. It is more their business and all technology, the governments and the police have to be aware [of], it is not just 3D printing.&quot; After finding that retirement was not for him, Hull returned to the company he co-founded and is now vice-president as well as chief technology officer, and holds shares worth $20m (\u00a312m). Last year, 3D Systems brought in revenues of more than $500m (\u00a3294m) and has three bases in the UK, in Hemel Hempstead, High Wycombe and Clevedon. New systems of 3D printing have emerged over the years and various other firms have been added to the 3D Systems stable. Last week the company launched the Ekocycle Cube printer in a collaboration with the singer Will.i.am, named chief creative officer in January, which is touted as being for everyday use and priced at $1,199 (\u00a3705). Stepping down is not an option at the moment for Hull, who declares the products of 3D printing, now including ranges of jewellery, as &quot;all his children&quot;. Future projects include working with Google on the company&apos;s next generation phone. &quot;We always say which room is it going to be in? I am not much of a futurist. It is really difficult for me to project. I sit there and work on the projects I have and I don&apos;t have a lot of say on where this is going.&quot; What can be printed? On a small plot in the north of Amsterdam, architects are building what they hope will be the first 3D-printed house. They are laying blocks that have been printed using a scaled-up version of an open-source 3D printer to be stacked like Lego bricks \u2013 one of the more elaborate examples of what can be produced using 3D printing. The recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas showcased printers that could produce foods such as ravioli and chocolate printed patterns, while Harvard researchers have recently unveiled what they say is the first 3D printed battery, which can be constructed in minutes. New in Tech this week \u2022 Will your next phone be 3D? Amazon&apos;s new Fire Phone uses a system of four cameras to constantly track its user&apos;s face and makes objects appear 3D using &quot;dynamic perspective&quot; \u2013 shifting the image around as the user tilts their head. Users can nod and use other gestures to navigate the phone too, which uses Amazon&apos;s own version of the Android software. But a camera on the back that can instantly recognise objects, books, art and goods is the killer feature for the online superstore.

Coming after it emerged that a staffer had lost \u00a33m on the foreign exchange market by betting mistakenly on a weak euro, the documents show that the group\u2019s financial department has faced a series of problems, and that its board is troubled by the lack of controls and lapses that allowed one person to lose so much money. Greenpeace, which prides itself on being largely funded by relatively small individual donations, apologised to supporters for the loss, claiming that the \u201cserious error of judgment\u201d was the result of a single staff member \u201cacting beyond the limits of their authority and without following proper procedures\u201d. But the documents show that internally the group is worried about the organisational failings that allowed it to happen. Minutes of a board meeting in the spring this year say: \u201cThe board takes this [the \u00a33m loss] very seriously and is deeply concerned that there should be such financial loss at a time of transition \u2013 when reserves are stretched and income is substantially lower than projected, and it is particularly troubled by how it happened, ie the lack of strong, coherent processes and controls that prevent the possibility that contracts can be entered into without due authorisation.\u201d One of the biggest and highest-profile environmental campaigning groups, Greenpeace has more than 2,000 employees globally and thousands more volunteers. It is based in Amsterdam and has 28 offices around the world, which campaign and raise funds independently, including Greenpeace UK, which this year successfully sent six activists to climb to the top of the Shard, Europe\u2019s tallest building, to send a message opposing Shell\u2019s plans for oil drilling in the Arctic. The leaked material also reveals that: \u2022 the group\u2019s public face and top campaigner, executive director Kumi Naidoo, admits that internal communications are a \u201chuge problem\u201d and staff have \u201cgood reason\u201d to be upset at a range of problems; \u2022 staff are concerned at being shifted from Amsterdam on Dutch wages to national offices on lower local wages, as part of a major restructuring effort to decentralise the group; \u2022 the group did not campaign to have one of its three ships, the Arctic Sunrise, released by Russia because the political circumstances would have made it a \u201cwasted effort\u201d.     A sign aboard the Greenpeace ship the Rainbow Warrior III during an open day in London, November 2011. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for The Guardian    The Guardian has also learned that one of the group\u2019s most senior executives, Pascal Husting, Greenpeace International\u2019s international programme director, works in Amsterdam but flies between the city\u2019s offices and his home in Luxembourg several times a month. Naidoo defended the arrangement, saying: \u201cPascal has a young family in Luxembourg. When he was offered the new role, he couldn\u2019t move his family to Amsterdam straight away. He\u2019d be the first to say he hates the commute, hates having to fly, but right now he hasn\u2019t got much of an option until he can move. He wishes there was an express train between his home and his office, but it would currently be a 12-hour round trip by train.\u201d The loss of \u00a33m, paid out this year, comes as the group is already dealing with lower than expected income, despite the Arctic 30 incident last year, when dozens of its activists and several journalists were imprisoned by Russia over a protest at oil drilling in the Arctic. Greenpeace International has said it will soon report a \u00a35.4m deficit \u2013 which includes the \u00a33m \u2013 for 2013. Mike Townsley, the group\u2019s head of communications, told AP last week of the \u00a33m loss: \u201cHindsight is 20/20, but we believe if he [the individual who made the transactions] had followed rules and procedures, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d However, a strategy document dated November 2013 shows that problems seem to extend well beyond one individual and that Greenpeace International\u2019s senior executive team was aware of widespread problems in its finance department that date back years. \u201c[The] international finance function at GPI [Greenpeace International] has faced internal team and management problems for several years and the situation did not improve during 2013 despite efforts and support,\u201d the document warns. \u201cThis has resulted in errors and sub-standards in the quality of financial systems, information and support provided to the teams, units in GPI and NROs [national reporting offices], and have on occasions adversely affected relationship between GPI and\u00a0NROs.\u201d As the story of the losses unfolded last week after it was broken by Der Spiegel and picked up by international media, Townsley emailed colleagues to say: \u201cThis is a bad story for us and the best we can do is be honest and respectful to our audiences.\u201d The leaked material seems to show disquiet over a continuing major restructuring, aimed at moving staff from Greenpeace International\u2019s base in Amsterdam to national offices across the world to fulfil Naidoo\u2019s goal of better tackling environmental problems in the global south. \u201cThis [2014] will be a testing year for all of us,\u201d the strategy document warns. Some staff are concerned at being moved from Dutch wages to lower, local wages at regional operations. An audio recording of a staff meeting this year includes a male employee telling Naidoo and other senior staff: \u201cOne of the biggest challenges is salaries \u2026 If I had to identify one problem clearly it\u2019s going to be salaries.\u201d      The audio recording reveals Naidoo telling the same meeting: \u201cOn communications \u2026 let me just concede that we have a huge problem with the way we are doing communications, I want to own that and take responsibility for that. It\u2019s not where it needs to be.\u201d He added: \u201cThere\u2019s good reason why people actually are upset about a range of things. But when I looked at what the problem was, it was actually a patent lack of communication, not just a lack of communication but not communicating at the right time, and things not clear.\u201d He later sent an email to staff admitting: \u201cLast Thursday\u2019s staff [meeting] was tough; hardly surprising given what we are trying to achieve and the impact that it will have upon all of us.\u201d The documents and material also give an insight into internal debates over future actions in Russia following the Arctic 30 last year, which eventually saw the release of all 30 activists and journalists and, earlier this month, the release of the group\u2019s icebreaker, the Arctic Sunrise. The ship is still in Murmansk, Russia, while Greenpeace arranges for people to examine its condition. \u201c[After the Arctic 30] one of the key debates we need to have is defining the ethical and appropriate levels of risk that we are willing to take,\u201d minutes of the board meeting this year note. The minutes also say: \u201cIt was queried why there has been no campaigning to bring attention to the AS [Arctic Sunrise] and gain public support for a successful return of the ship since the safe return of the activists. Pascal [Husting] said that under the current political circumstances launching a campaign to free the ship would probably be a wasted effort.\u201d Gerald Steinberg, president of NGO Monitor, which seeks to make NGOs more transparent and accountable, said he saw parallels with the financial problems Amnesty International had experienced in recent years. \u201cThe extent of it [the financial problems] was not something I expected [at Greenpeace]. But it\u2019s part of the fact that NGOs keep things very much within the organisation; there\u2019s no culture of accountability. They call on governments to be accountable but they lack this in so many ways, so in that sense it\u2019s not a surprise.\u201d     Two Greenpeace activists display a banner beneath the clock face of Big Ben on the first anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. Photograph: David Bebber/Reuters    He said a shift in culture was required to address the problems. \u201cIt requires a cultural change. NGOs tend to see themselves as insurgents. They have now become the establishment but without the structures that are required for such large organisations \u2013 they can no longer think of themselves as insurgents but as corporate organisations. That hurts their self-image but there is no other way to avoid the financial meltdowns that can take place.\u201d Naidoo told the Guardian that changes were already under way to address the handling of its budget. \u201cGreenpeace International\u2019s annual accounts have always been given a clean bill of health by independent auditors. However, there have definitely been ongoing problem with some of the systems and high staff turnover in our international finance unit, no denying it. \u201cThat\u2019s why I hired a new head of finance who has over 20 years\u2019 experience working with international NGOs. We have also strengthened his team. He\u2019s already put checks in place to make sure the problems we have had are a thing of the past.\u201d He also said the restructuring was not about reducing staff numbers but about redeploying people. \u201cThis restructuring is not about reducing the number of people working full time on Greenpeace campaigns; it\u2019s about making sure we have people where we need them, and increasingly that\u2019s not in Amsterdam. The big environmental issues are increasingly in the southern hemisphere, be it Indonesian or Amazonian deforestation, Chinese coal plants or overfishing in the Indian and Pacific Ocean.\u201d", "sentences": ["The handling of Greenpeace International\u2019s \u00a358m budget has been in disarray for years, with its financial team beset by personnel problems and a lack of rigorous processes, leading to errors, substandard work and a souring of relationships between its Amsterdam headquarters and offices around the world, documents leaked to the Guardian show.", "It is based in Amsterdam and has 28 offices around the world, which campaign and raise funds independently, including Greenpeace UK, which this year successfully sent six activists to climb to the top of the Shard, Europe\u2019s tallest building, to send a message opposing Shell\u2019s plans for oil drilling in the Arctic.", "The leaked material also reveals that: \u2022 the group\u2019s public face and top campaigner, executive director Kumi Naidoo, admits that internal communications are a \u201chuge problem\u201d and staff have \u201cgood reason\u201d to be upset at a range of problems; \u2022 staff are concerned at being shifted from Amsterdam on Dutch wages to national offices on lower local wages, as part of a major restructuring effort to decentralise the group; \u2022 the group did not campaign to have one of its three ships, the Arctic Sunrise, released by Russia because the political circumstances would have made it a \u201cwasted effort\u201d.", "Photograph: Graeme Robertson for The Guardian    The Guardian has also learned that one of the group\u2019s most senior executives, Pascal Husting, Greenpeace International\u2019s international programme director, works in Amsterdam but flies between the city\u2019s offices and his home in Luxembourg several times a month.", "When he was offered the new role, he couldn\u2019t move his family to Amsterdam straight away.", "\u201cThis has resulted in errors and sub-standards in the quality of financial systems, information and support provided to the teams, units in GPI and NROs [national reporting offices], and have on occasions adversely affected relationship between GPI and\u00a0NROs.\u201d As the story of the losses unfolded last week after it was broken by Der Spiegel and picked up by international media, Townsley emailed colleagues to say: \u201cThis is a bad story for us and the best we can do is be honest and respectful to our audiences.\u201d The leaked material seems to show disquiet over a continuing major restructuring, aimed at moving staff from Greenpeace International\u2019s base in Amsterdam to national offices across the world to fulfil Naidoo\u2019s goal of better tackling environmental problems in the global south.", "\u201cThis restructuring is not about reducing the number of people working full time on Greenpeace campaigns; it\u2019s about making sure we have people where we need them, and increasingly that\u2019s not in Amsterdam."], "title": "Greenpeace losses: leaked documents reveal extent of financial disarray", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/23/greenpeace-losses-financial-disarray", "tags": ["Greenpeace", "Environmental activism", "Kumi Naidoo", "Arctic 30 protesters", "Environment", "World news", "Netherlands", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-23T13:41:47Z", "article": "The head of Greenpeace UK has defended the need for one of the environmental group&apos;s top executives to fly to work several times a month, and apologised to supporters for a mistake that saw a member of its finance team lose \u00a33m on currency markets.

Such is the penetration of Nordic noir into our consciousness that even driving the route on a bright summer day, with the five-mile structure glinting in the sunlight, you are thrust back into those bleak scenes featuring the socially awkward Saga Nor\u00e9n and her Danish sidekick Martin Rohde. As the pair pursued a perpetrator whose killing spree put Hannibal Lector in the shade, The Bridge explored extreme violence, political activism and social dysfunction in both nations. Travelling from Denmark to the point where the body was discovered, the city of Malmo is visible through the windscreen as Copenhagen recedes in the rear-view mirror. While dramatists linked the two cities around an outbreak of violence that seemed to suggest something deeply wrong at the root of both societies, it is not a tendency to breed serial killers that the cities share, but an ambition to drive out crime by injecting the ideas of an open, democratic and empathetic society into the very bricks and mortar that surround its citizens. In the UK the authorities have tended to adopt a hostile and defensive architectural response to crime and anti-social behaviour: the erection of thousands of CCTV cameras, provision of gated communities and, most recently, the use of metal spikes in the streets. But in Scandinavia, despite higher rates of homicide and assaults than the UK, according to OECD figures, this approach has been rejected in favour of a softer option. The results can be seen in developments like the one in the southern harbour area of Copenhagen, Sluseholmen \u2013 once a working-class dock \u2013 which has been regenerated around a canal system in a deliberate copy of Amsterdam. Low-rise modern flats with large windows and private balconies or gardens have been built around inner courtyards. Fences are replaced with glass and perspex, encouraging light to bounce off the surfaces, and increasing visibility of the families looking out on to the square and neighbours looking in. The aim is to use the natural surveillance of the residents as a powerful form of crime prevention.     The former docks area of Sluseholmen in Copenhagen uses a canal system as a natural defence against crime. Photograph:        Bo Gr\u00f6nlund    In the middle of the courtyard, a children\u2019s play area is well used. Toys lie scattered around, and babies sleep in prams around the edge of the space. The canals flow up the sides and back of the buildings, and the blocks look out on to the harbour itself. Bikes and kayaks \u2013 used by the residents to get to work in central Copenhagen \u2013 are left unlocked. There are no dark alleys or dead ends, and the atmosphere is open, calming and welcoming. Most strikingly for a visitor from the UK, there is not one CCTV camera. Walking around Sluseholmen is the architect Bo Gr\u00f6nlund. In his mid-70s, a small, energetic white-haired man, his enthusiasm about the impact architects can have on reducing crime is no less today than when he was a young man. Eyes bright with zeal, Gr\u00f6nlund talks rapidly, gesticulating at architectural features in the area which, he says, make residents safer. \u201cThe water is used here,\u201d he gesticulates, \u201cas a natural defence. You see how it is all along one side of the building \u2013 no one can break in from there. It is built around the courtyard principle where you have a public space in the interior. The car park is underground and not visible. There are no cameras here, of course. We are quite sceptical about them because they can almost only be used after a crime has taken place; they do not prevent it. \u201cThis is a calming environment, it is not provocative. If you do things that tell you that you are a bad person \u2013 like have cameras or gates everywhere \u2013 you might become that bad person, at least a little bit.\u201d Gr\u00f6nlund was part of a group of architects in the 1980s who tried to put designing out crime at the heart of city planning. They drew up recommendations to give planners and designers a better chance of shaping the physical environment to minimise violence and vandalism. \u201cAt the time the only publication around crime prevention from the EU was a British one, and it was very British in its thinking: with fences, cameras and alarms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to do it in another way very consciously. The basis was that Denmark should continue to be an open society with a minimum of physical barring and formal surveillance.\u201d     The 1980s Sibelius estate is considered a model of how to design out crime. Photograph:        Bo Gr\u00f6nlund    A leading figure in the movement, architect John Allpass, was responsible for designing the first housing area in Denmark where creating safety and security was implicit in the design. Five miles out of Copenhagen, the Sibelius estate is still considered a model of the designing out crime philosophy, shaped around:  Creating a social space where the natural surveillance of the people within it prevents crime. Increasing people\u2019s attachment to an area. Encouraging people to use common areas with seating, foyers and lobbies that invite social contact. Providing facilities for adults and young people in particular. Limiting the number of access points from surrounding streets. Frequent inspection and repair of vandalism. Avoiding alleyways, hiding places and blind spots, and only using locks cameras and physical barriers as a last resort.  Bronzed and relaxed, Karsten Ellekaer is a familiar figure on the estate. He arrived here in 1985, shortly after the first phase was completed, with a young child. He brought up his family here and, though recently retired, has no intention of living anywhere else. \u201cWhy would I want to leave? This is a wonderful place to live,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have very little crime here. From the start everything was built in a certain way. The idea is the buildings are placed in the middle of an industrial area, which means that tenants can keep an eye on the industrial units at night, and when the tenants are out at work, there are people working in the industries who can act as a natural surveillance for the properties here.\u201d There is a bar run by tenants, a cafe, a laundry \u2013 where cards are swiped rather than cash used \u2013 a fitness centre and a common house which tenants can hire for parties. Neatly tended private gardens, with low hedges to increase visibility, line an inner road through the estate which is used by pedestrians, cyclists and drivers. The passage of people is another intended form of \u2018eyes on the street\u2019 surveillance to reduce crime. Ellekaer spends his days walking around the estate checking for graffiti, litter, signs of criminal damage. As the tenants\u2019 association leader, he runs a team of caretakers who are busy weeding the verges alongside the interior road. On the basis of the \u2018broken windows\u2019 theory \u2013 that vandalism and graffiti, if left, can escalate into more serious crime \u2013 so maintenance is deemed to be part of increasing safety and security.     Sibelius in Copenhagen takes maintenance seriously. Photograph:        Bo Gr\u00f6nlund    But there are no CCTV cameras or warning signs banning skateboarding, littering or anti-social behaviour. \u201cThey are not necessary,\u201d Ellekaer says. Behind the high-wire fence of the national police headquarters a few miles away, Karsten Nielsen, a former police officer, sits in his small prefab office which is dwarfed by the police station opposite. A quiet and thoughtful man, he leads the Danish Crime Prevention Council and believes there is a vital philosophy behind his country\u2019s desire to make its people feel safe without locking them in. The Sibelius estate, he says, brought together all the best ideas of building secure and safe environments. \u201cWe want a society we live in to be a free, open society, and we don\u2019t want to lock any gates or make barriers unless it is absolutely necessary,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating safety and reducing crime through urban planning in the built environment, on the streets, in the living areas we create. It relates to all major crime categories like theft and burglary, vandalism and violence.\u201d But attempts to remodel Sibelius have not all been successful; some designs have created public spaces which are too large for the population \u2013 lending the feel of a suburb so deserted it feels like the aftermath of a nuclear attack. There is also, in some areas, a sense that the life has been designed away, leaving only a husk of anything that makes a city interesting to live in. \u201cYou cannot have a completely safe city and a completely exciting city at the same time, they are completely contradictory,\u201d Gr\u00f6nlund suggests. \u201cYou need to have the exciting part of the city which is perhaps somewhat dangerous. So it has to be balanced and in proportion.\u201d Look at any guidebook and one of the most \u201cexciting, vibrant and cosmopolitan\u201d areas of inner-Copenhagen is Norrebro, where nearly 30% of inhabitants are from immigrant communities and the organic cafes, bars and chic baby shops rub up against cheap kebab takeaways, pound shops and slightly seedy clubs.     Graffiti at Norrebro station in Copenhagen. Photograph: Francis Dean/Rex    Norrebro \u2013 according to police statistics \u2013 also has a higher rate of crime than many other areas of Copenhagen, with 2,200 crimes reported per square kilometre. These include gang-related activities including drug dealing, possession of weapons and robberies, as well as shop burglaries, vandalism and graffiti.  Daubed with the graffiti of rival gangs along its main streets, the area has been the scene of many riots over the years, most recently in 2007 when the police moved in and evicted squatters from the Youth House, a social centre and base for environmental activists. Now it is the subject of a detailed report by Gr\u00f6nlund into how to alter the environment in order to reduce the crime. \u201cObviously it is [only] small changes you can make; you cannot pull everything down and start again. It is about working with the buildings and making adjustments.\u201d Some in Norrebro, however, fear that an attempt to design out the crime on their streets could eradicate the very reasons they live here \u2013 its radical edge, multiculturalism and all-round funkiness.  Young people gather around cafe tables in the main square, where plant shops vie for space with juice bars and vegetarian restaurants. \u201cThere are some gangs here and there is drug dealing, but I don\u2019t feel this is a dangerous place at all,\u201d says Hanne Kold, who runs a baby shop in the square.  \u201cA lot of people who hang around come here because they need somewhere to go; they are part of this place,\u201d Kold adds. \u201cThey don\u2019t make too much trouble because this is their place too. I wouldn\u2019t want this area being changed in some major way \u2013 I don\u2019t see why they should want to do that.\u201d \u2022 Inside Rio\u2019s James Bond-style control centre", "sentences": ["The results can be seen in developments like the one in the southern harbour area of Copenhagen, Sluseholmen \u2013 once a working-class dock \u2013 which has been regenerated around a canal system in a deliberate copy of Amsterdam."], "title": "Designing out crime in Scandinavia: \u2018Cities cannot be completely safe and completely exciting at the same time\u2019", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/24/designing-out-crime-scandinavia-copenhagen-cities-safe-exciting", "tags": ["Cities", "Design", "Architecture", "Crime", "The Bridge", "Denmark", "Sweden", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-06-24T12:51:42Z", "article": "Greenpeace has said its international programme director will no longer commute to work by plane.

In a statement, Husting said: \u201cTo be frank I\u2019m embarrassed, it was a misjudgment, there\u2019s no doubt about it. It was meant to be a temporary arrangement so I could do the job and be with my family because my kids are so young, but that\u2019s not good enough.

Well it\u2019s a really tough one. Was it the right decision to allow him to use air travel to try to balance his job with the needs of his family for a while?&quot; The group&apos;s international executive director, Kumi Naidoo, also defended the the arrangement, saying: \u201cPascal has a young family in Luxembourg.

The much-coveted prizes, the Lions, are a way for agencies to measure up and convince their clients that their steep hourly rates are justified. But why should you care about backslapping and champagne-popping by marketers, invading the Riviera to celebrate themselves? The Festival of Creativity offers a snapshot of the marketing year 2014 and a thermometer reading of global markets. No advertising festival or awards show plays a more powerful role in the industry, receiving more than 37,000 entries and attracting more than 12,000 advertising professionals from 93 countries. But the big question is: how was 2014? Epic splits or epic ignorance? I would like to say the following to agencies: a commercial with Jean-Claude Van Damme doing what&apos;s been dubbed &quot;the epic split&quot; between two Volvo trucks is a bombastic dramatisation of an incremental product difference and entertaining as hell, but your clients are facing bigger challenges. They&apos;ll soon have to welcome up to two billion new consumers to the market and most resources are already scarce. They are faced with new types of consumption where it&apos;s not about owning a car, but rather the experience or the service you get, or travelling from A to B in the smartest possible way. Collaborative models are a growing market, and digital and tech thinking has completely disrupted business as we know it, for example Airbnb challenging the hotel industry, and hitting $1.7bn (\u00a31bn ) in sales in just six years. Your clients (and you) are met by virtualisation, where products that were an everyday part of our lives in recent memory no longer exist. Think about paper calendars, alarm clocks or photo albums. Add to this a shift in mindset where a recent survey tell us that around 70% of people think that businesses should come up with solutions to some of society&apos;s biggest challenges, such as unemployment and climate change. How will agencies respond to these challenges? More &quot;epic splits&quot;? More tomfoolery? This year&apos;s ad fest showed few examples of agencies understanding this new reality, compared to the ocean of advertising-as-usual. Make a mark on the world  Let&apos;s look at some of the work where brands (and agencies) dare to make a mark. In a campaign by Whybin\\TBWA for ANZ Bank&apos;s sponsorship of Sydney&apos;s Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, regular ATMs were turned into unique GAYTMs encrusted with rhinestones, sequins, studs, leather, denim and fur to deliver the free-spirited civil rights message of equality. Lots of brands are leaving the closet and jumping on board the equal rights wagon and Honey Maid&apos;s This is Wholesome campaign is another well-crafted example, deserving its share of Lion statuettes. Less barking, more beautifying   But there&apos;s so much more brands can do than just bring attention to important issues. Just like any ad break, the festival itself had star-studded appearances. Kanye West, for example, had his say about the state of flux in ad land: &quot;The thing younger people are begging for is a more beautiful world where brands help people achieve things rather than simply barking at them.&quot; Brands have a unique opportunity to play a bigger role in people&apos;s lives and to deliver on real needs rather than just creating wants. One such campaign, Speaking Exchange, was for a language school in Brazil that used Skype to facilitate dialogues between senior citizens in the US to improve their students&apos; language skills while building a bridge over a generational gap. Another campaign took on the food waste agenda with a clever solution preventing perfectly fine vegetables and fruit from being discarded because they didn&apos;t fit our image of what nature looks like. Supermarket chain Intermarch\u00e9 (Agency: Marcel, Paris) rebranded them as Inglorious fruits and vegetables. They even cut the price by 30% to make fruits and veggies more affordable for more people. Colgate Palmolive (Agency: Red Fuse Communications, Hong Kong) made a cunning upcycling initiative, using the boxes from their products as educational materials for under-financed rural schools to educate kids about proper dental hygiene. In another upcycling initiative, Raw for the Oceans, G-Star Raw worked with Pharrell Williams (Agency: FHV BBDO Amsterdam) to turn the plastic waste in our oceans into a pair of jeans made from reclaimed plastic (33% bionic yarn). The power of creativity  These are examples of agencies that dare to decipher the complex reality of their clients&apos; businesses and come up with more than a quick-fire solution to a marketing challenge that will be forgotten when the next YouTube video goes viral. A good example of the shared value gained from this thinking is the Dove Beauty sketches (Agency: Ogilvy Brazil) that won an effectiveness award. The creative thrust of the campaign is a testament to its long-lived effectiveness. Chipotle is another brand showcasing the mileage in making a real difference with their follow-up to Back to the start (Agency: CCA, Los Angeles) called Scarecrow. As well as pushing the boundaries of advertising by launching a series of webisodes, Farmed and dangerous  mixes information with entertainment. It&apos;s amazing to see what a difference creativity can make, if it&apos;s applied to a cause beyond beefing up an agency&apos;s self-esteem. Creativity can and should do far more than dramatise incremental product differences. If applied with insight, big ideas can build resilient, trailblazing businesses, which are much more exciting in the long term than watching the muscles from Brussels doing the splits. Brands must demand more from their agency partner. I value the strong focus on charities and worthwhile causes like Act Responsible, the Grand Prix for Good and the Cannes Chimera at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, but agencies need a guiding hand on the shoulder, rather than just a pat to make the transition from insecure, attention-seeking lion cubs to kings of the ad Savannah.

In fact, he&apos;s both \u2013 Greenpeace&apos;s international programme director was exposed this week as a plane commuter \u2013 and that&apos;s what has fired another torpedo into the scull of the environmental movement. What,\u00a0exactly, is the point of a campaign whose top brass cannot bring themselves to eschew the very behaviour they&apos;re campaigning against? Yet if there is one thing more depressing than a world-class environmentalist flying from Luxembourg to Amsterdam as a commute, it&apos;s how easy it is to set greens, deep greens and green-leaners against one another. The best way to never be a hypocrite, and to always stay consistent, is to deny climate change, and have no agenda on anything beyond self-interest. There&apos;s always a chance you&apos;ll fall foul of sexual morality, which is the only kind you will still admit into debate, but in every other realm, ethics need not trouble you. Indeed, the more ardently you pursue your own interests, the more persuasively you live your own values. If, on the other hand, you have ambitions for large-scale change and believe things could be significantly better for vast numbers of people, you will always fail fully to embody your own hopes. It won&apos;t necessarily be by flying. You\u00a0might buy your kid some trainers in Primark, or buy yourself clothes you don&apos;t need; you might eat meat. You\u00a0might sometimes drive when you could take public transport, or take public transport when you could cycle. It will always be possible for someone not just to critique your choices, but also to critique them on the same terms, using the same measures, as you critique the choices made by society. To be entirely untainted by the flaws of civilisation, you would have to live outside it: off-grid, deep green, breathing some other air. This, however, would diminish your impact, because you would de facto be excluded from public life. The territory is knee-deep in the squelch of compromise, and nobody likes to dwell on this more than the people to whom the fact of climate change is in itself distasteful. I have sat in meetings while people from rightwing newspapers laugh at a Green politician getting a taxi home from a midnight TV interview \u2013 as if, for\u00a0the audacity of believing things could be better, her whole life should be lived in penance. The assumption underneath is that self-interest is the baseline; anything more ambitious has to be paid for in sweat and tears. It would be good if we could rewrite that, so that hoping for better was a collective, not a personal, adventure, and self-interest was the thing that had to be constantly justified. Flying is in its own peculiar league, of course. If roughly a quarter of a person&apos;s carbon footprint is transport, then this is the easiest, most discretionary splurge, which is why greens have been campaigning against it for years. It&apos;s also extremely visible. When Rio+20 \u2013 the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \u2013 took place two years ago, Ed Gillespie, author of Only Planet: A Flight-Free Adventure Around the World, said: &quot;I remember talking to a journalist from the BBC about it, and asking what her line was going to be. She said, &apos;How ironic that environmentalists from across the world have all taken a plane to get here.&apos; I just thought, is that the best you can do?&quot; Greenpeace&apos;s problems run wider and deeper than one person&apos;s travel arrangements \u2013 Husting has now said he will take the train rather than the plane. The organisation recently lost \u00a33m on currency speculation, which will be extremely difficult to explain to its mainly small-amount donors. Greenpeace has made a stab at an explanation already, which is that, since\u00a0its donations mainly come\u00a0in euros\u00a0but were spent in other currencies, this left it &quot;highly exposed&quot; to fluctuations in the currency markets; exchange contracts protected them. It&apos;s unfortunate the protection came at such a high risk and with a price of its own. Greenpeace was behaving like a corporation which campaigns, and makes business decisions to protect its wherewithal for campaigning, rather than a charity with values. The former asks myopic questions about where to keep its euros safe; the latter would ask panoramic questions about the financial deals it did and whether there was a\u00a0deeper message in the volatility. Charities are notorious for this, and have been for years: investing in businesses that work expressly against their beliefs; sinking their reserves into stock portfolios of arms and tobacco companies. It&apos;s as easy a target as a flying environmentalist, but a more proper one. When charities drop their standards and lose their capacity for self-examination, they traduce the values of the people who donate money to them. It&apos;s bigger than the misuse of\u00a0funds; it&apos;s a mockery of the ideas that\u00a0raised them. Compared with this, the sin of flying looks rather small. After all, it would be better if nobody flew. Environmentalists have never been perfect enough to silence their opponents \u2013 such perfection probably doesn&apos;t exist. The aim is to work towards better systems, not exist in this system as superior people. The greens have a new tone, distilled in Gillespie&apos;s book. &quot;I&apos;m not asking you to give anything up; I&apos;m asking you to rediscover something wonderful. You\u00a0won&apos;t miss that airport if you dare to step out of it. You can get anywhere in Europe within 24 hours on a train; it puts the romance and adventure back into travel.

We&apos;re in a vast, strip-lit venue that serves up dog stew washed down with soju and some form of kimchi in virtually every dish \u2013 but the restaurant\u2019s main selling point is that it offers a window onto the world\u2019s most secretive state. Welcome to Pyongyang restaurant in Phnom Penh, one of a chain of eateries owned by Office 39, an arm of the North Korean government, that have sprung up across Asia since the 1990s to channel money back to the regime  On the night we visit the Phnom Penh branch is packed with hundreds of diners, mostly Cambodian and South Korean men. TripAdvisor reviews give the chain an average four star rating and offer praise such as \u201ca second degree kitsch experience\u201d and \u201cauthentic North Korean style\u201d.      Pyongyang Restaurant in Phnom Penh Photograph: Charlotte Pert    According to North Korean expert and author Bertil Lintner the restaurants have several financial benefits for the regime: \u201cThe North Korean government runs those restaurants to a) raise foreign exchange for the government in Pyongyang, b) to finance the activities of the North Korean embassy in the country where a restaurant is located, and c) to launder money from other activities,\u201d he says, adding that restaurants are \u201cperfect vehicles\u201d for money-laundering.  The first handful of Pyongyang Restaurants sprang up in northern China, near the border with the DPRK during the 1990s. But the 21st century brought with it a boom - with an estimated 100 branches across Asia. In 2012 a Pyongyang restaurant opened in Amsterdam, the first in Europe. It closed after a few months but another re-opened at the end of last year. They may seem like a harmless tourist attraction, but the money is used to prop up a state accused of grave human rights abuses against its people, say experts. Waitresses staffing the restaurants are not free to come and go, for fear they will escape. James Hoare, a North Korean specialist at Soas University of London and former British charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Pyongyang, said the waitresses, who are recruited partly because they are from politically loyal families, live in compounds near the premises.      Diners at the Pyongyang Restaurant in Phnom Penh. Photograph: Charlotte Pert    \u201cThey would be from the political elite; the sort of people who live and work in Pyongyang. Nobody else gets to go abroad,\u201d he said. The reason for this, he adds, is that they are less likely to escape.  And to escape is to defect. Recently a waitress at one of the Pyongyang restaurants fled to Thailand with a South Korean man, sparking fresh tensions between the Koreas. There are fears her that her family back home will be made to suffer because of her behaviour.  Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official at a Pyongyang restaurant said that although waitresses were allowed to leave the compound to \u201cgo shopping\u201d, to escape would be to defect and would surely result in government punishment. He said the restaurant was owned by \u201ca company\u201d that sponsors the North Korean national football team. \u201cActually my restaurant is involved in sports investment,\u201d he said.  Asked if waitresses are allowed to go out and socialise with non-North Koreans, he asked: \u201cWhy would they want to do that?

For him, checking the inside of the vehicle for cyclists, long before turning, is just part of driving safely. Now, Transport for London (TfL), which issued the stickers, seems to see the problem too, and has agreed to ask fleet operators to remove them. TfL will replace the \u201cstay back\u201d stickers on buses with a more appropriate message \u2013 according to the CTC we\u2019ll see these by the end of the summer. The new stickers will sound more like a warning than a command, however. The move follows months of criticism of the stickers from a coalition of campaigners and cyclists and it may not seem like a big deal but, as Peter Walker eloquently put it recently, the wording is important. The much maligned yellow rectangle was originally designed, no doubt with good intentions, to warn people not to ride their bikes down the inside of a large vehicle whose blind spot could hide an entire car. Left-turning lorries pose one of the greatest risks to cyclists on the roads. However, as the stickers spread from the near sides of buses to the near and off sides of vans and minibuses around the country \u2013 vehicles with perfectly adequate vision of the road \u2013 they ended up looking like an ultimatum for cyclists to not cycle anywhere, or to do so at their own risk. Attitudes on the roads, which govern how safe journeys by bicycle feel, are important, and if we\u2019re to get more people getting about by this cheap, healthy and fun means we need everyone to understand that the roads are public spaces for everyone, no matter how they get around. Staying stationary is not much of an option, however you choose to travel. TfL will be working on new wording for stickers on lorries, and rightly so. Until the lorries we share our streets with have direct vision of the road around them, the problem isn\u2019t going away. The challenge now will be to get companies around the country to get rid of the stickers \u2013 reported to have spread to small company vans as far away as Edinburgh and Manchester.

He was also a pioneer in the field of gay film. Although the explicit nature of his work will put off many, there is real warmth and joy to it: the encounters he shows are neither smutty nor seedy, no less loving for their rawness or brevity. Casual does not equate to cold. De Rome&apos;s films are, rather, intelligently wrought miniatures fully engaged with their subjects. His skill in storytelling and his joky surrealism mixed with bold sexuality has something of the richness of Cocteau (whom he adored) or the exuberance of George Kuchar. It has the passion of Kenneth Anger and the pop cultural sensibility of Andy Warhol. Having worked as a film publicist, with no technical training, he seems to have acquired his film-making skills by osmosis from his acquaintance with the likes of Alexander Korda, David O Selznick or Orson Welles. But his achievement is uniquely his own.     A scene from Dreams from a Cross Town. Bus Photograph: BFI    His career began as a hobby. In the early 1960s De Rome, like many, bought a standard 8mm home-movie camera. Initially he planned to record civil rights demonstrations in the deep south, but that soon turned into playful shorts and travelogues, then into erotica. In part his film-making was, at the start, a means to a fairly primal end. But this intent does not diminish the beauty of the execution. His early films are short devotionals. Butch Easter (1966) was one of his favourites, until recently thought lost. He met its subject at an Easter parade and spent the rest of the day filming him, eventually editing the footage into a sweet account of this handsome black man.     De Rome lacing up a projector in his Manhattan apartment to show some of his original 8mm short films. Photograph: BFI    He had no hang-ups about his sexuality, and no trouble picking up men. Yet he was working at a time when many like him were stricken with guilt and when it was largely illegal to show explicit gay sex. He could probably have been arrested for creating pornography but he found a way to trick the censors by shooting something innocuous at the beginning and end of each reel. Astonishingly, his Super 8 films were returned from the developers at Kodak regular as clockwork. The results were screened, at first, at private parties where he turned up with his portable projector and his own choice of musical soundtrack (Messaien, Hindemith and Miles Davis were among his regular choices). They were much appreciated by many, including Warhol, William Burroughs and John Gielgud, who were friends and confidants. The latter was so keen on De Rome&apos;s film-making that he wrote a short script which would have been set in a gentlemen&apos;s outfitters, but was never made. Gielgud offered to do a voiceover to another of his films, the unfinished Kensington Gorey, but only on the condition that his contribution would be anonymous, seemingly unaware of the instantly recognisable nature of his voice. Yet although De Rome began as a happy amateur, content to make films for his own and his friends&apos; amusement, he got a big break when Hot Pants, won a prize at the first International Wet Dream festival in Amsterdam in 1971. John Russell Taylor reviewed it in the Times and looked forward to the day that such films would be shown at the National Film Theatre (now BFI Southbank). &apos;His legacy is not just his films, but his commitment, determination and grace. He believed that his homosexuality was a natural and joyful thing&apos;     A scene from De Rome's Prometheus. Photograph: BFI    Such success helped him to fund two full-length erotic featurs, which \u2013 unlike most of those of his contemporaries \u2013 had a narrative and a sense of humour. Adam &amp; Yves (1974) was his first encounter with a professional film crew and was meant to be a gay Last Tango in Paris. It also included the last ever appearance of Greta Garbo on film. Garbo was a neighbour in Manhattan and was a creature of very regular habit. He was able to shoot her from his rooftop looking down into the street as she spoke to a friend outside a shop. The film also boasts one of his favourite scenes, an orgy of a dozen black men in a toilet. Two years later came The Destroying Angel \u2013 a much darker piece, based on the story by Edgar Allan Poe; a nightmarish series of encounters for a young seminarian with a devilish character and magic mushrooms. De Rome stopped making films as the Aids epidemic began. Pornography was changing. Producers were less interested in stories and wanting to get straight to the action. He lived to experience the internet generation&apos;s forays into the genre but he preferred his own films \u2013 more subtle, more human, more artful. He wanted to make films which were sexy but didn&apos;t show everything. The BFI&apos;s 2012 DVD release of The Erotic Films of Peter de Rome was a landmark in certification. It was the first time that films featuring explicit gay sex had been classified as 18, a tribute to his power as an artist. I became aware of his world of easy sex and beautiful men in 1974 via a copy of Films and Filming magazine in my local library. It carried a double-page spread of stills from his work and was something of a revelation to this shy Ulster teenager. I first met him in New York 32 years later (he divided his time between the US and his native Kent). We arranged to meet at a coffee shop near his Midtown flat and his gentle, pixieish charm was immediately evident. He was anxious about the future of his film collection and so we set off to his apartment on the fifth floor, where he breezed up the stairs with no difficulty (he was then 82). There were posters from Broadway shows and a group of about half a dozen African wooden statues along the wall of his small living room. He pulled out a wooden box which contained dozens of carefully labelled cans of different sizes along with music cassettes. We agreed that he would be happy to donate his work to the BFI national archive. But at this stage he didn&apos;t want to let it all go, preferring to hang on to some of his more personal pieces, such as the 1979 short Brown Study. (I am eternally grateful both to him, and that the cheap Kuwaiti Air flight on which I hand-carried the films home did not fly via Kuwait. This was the first time that the BFI had taken gay erotic films into its collection.)     A scene from Double Exposure. Photograph: BFI    The following year De Rome came to London himself for a screening at what was then the Lesbian and Gay Film Festival (now BFI Flare) and held an audience rapt with amazing stories. It was a great event, the realisation of Russell Taylor&apos;s hope back in 1971. De Rome later wrote to me to say it was one of the happiest days of his life.He was disappointed not to make it to Sheffield earlier this month for the world premiere of a feature-length documentary about his life and films, but he was well aware of its glowing critical reception. On 11 June he was interviewed for BBC Radio 3; he drank a glass of champagne and charmed his interviewer with anecdotes. Then, 10 days later at home in Sandwich, Kent, he died of complications due to leukaemia. De Rome&apos;s legacy is not just his films, but his commitment, determination and grace. He believed that his homosexuality was a natural and joyful thing and had testified to this effect at the 1956 Wolfenden Committee (whose report was instrumental in the decriminalisation of homosexuality). His spirit was an inspiration to a younger generation of gay men and his late fame led to interviews in the likes of Butt, Little Joe and Vice magazines. His work offers everyone a window into another world, when modern notions of the possibilities of a gay life without shame were just beginning.

Frank de Boer? Yes, he would never miss twice, so he will step up,\u201d said Dutch commentator Theo Reitsma as De Boer took the long walk to the spot. De Boer\u2019s twin brother Ronald had told him to go hard down the middle, and that was the plan. \u201cI was not even that nervous,\u201d De Boer said. \u201c[The Italy goalkeeper Francesco] Toldo made it into a game. He winked at me. But this time I had no doubts. I wanted to tell him: \u2018So you know where I\u2019m going to shoot, good for you.\u2019\u201d De Boer winked back but he hit a weak shot, right of centre, which Toldo stopped with his feet. \u201cIt was only because I was tired that I hit it badly. We were mentally drained by this time, and our previous record at penalties was not giving us any hope.\u201d Then Gianluca Pessotto scored and Jaap Stam blasted over the bar. It was 2-0 Italy. Francesco Totti was next. The previous day, Totti had beaten Alessandro Nesta at PlayStation football after training, and scored one of his goals with a penalty cucchiaio, Italian for the Panenka. \u201cOne of these days I will do it in a game,\u201d he told him. When Di Biagio returned from his kick, Totti said: \u201cMo je faccio er cucchiaio.\u201d \u201cNow I will do \u2018the spoon\u2019.\u201d Paolo Maldini had overheard him. \u201cIs he crazy?\u201d said the captain. \u201cThere is a final on the line.\u201d Totti did not change his mind. Edwin van der Sar dived right and Totti\u2019s chip flew perfectly down the centre of the goal. \u201cTo take a penalty like that you must be crazy or very good,\u201d Totti later said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d Italy were 3-0 up and won the shootout 3-1 after Paul Bosvelt missed. After the game, the Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard resigned, but not before pointing out how hard shootouts are. \u201cWe practised almost every day, but it\u2019s something unique to the game and we showed once again we\u2019re no good at it.\u201d The numbers bear that out. The average conversion rate in a penalty shootout is 76% (that figure drops to 71% in the highly-pressured World Cup environment) but Holland\u2019s conversion rate is only 67%. At the other end, their opponents have scored 88% of their penalties. Rijkaard was merely echoing the words of his coaching mentor Johan Cruyff whose opinion, as a national icon, has dictated Holland\u2019s attitude to penalties more than anything else. Cruyff is assumed to be a penalty expert because, in 1982, against Helmond Sport, he scored a famous penalty after exchanging passes from the spot with team-mate Jesper Olsen. Never mind that Cruyff was not the first to succeed with this type of penalty \u2013 that was the brilliant Rik Coppens, for Belgium, in 1957 \u2013 but more significantly, this was the first, and indeed only, official penalty he took for Ajax, after 10 years and more than 250 appearances for the team. If he took them in training, remembered reserve goalkeeper Ron Boomgaard, it was only \u201cto try crazy things and humiliate his opponent\u201d. Henk Groot, Gerrie M\u00fchren and Johan Neeskens were ahead of Cruyff in the penalty list for Ajax, and for Holland, Neeskens and Rob Rensenbrink had the responsibility. At the start of his final season as a professional, at Feyenoord, Cruyff played against Roma in a friendly tournament. The game went to penalties, and Cruyff, hoping to impress his new team, stepped up. \u201cI\u2019d played two games in two days plus extra time, and was living on my nerves,\u201d he told TV hosts Frits Barend and Henk van Dorp. \u201cYou do your little walk back to run up at the ball. You close your eyes and you see where it will end up. That one, it ended up in the second-tier seats. The goal was small before the penalties began. The higher the tension, the smaller the goal gets.\u201d There are two theories why Cruyff did not fancy penalties. One is that the essence of Cruyff the footballer was all about movement and intuition and that the idea of standing still and waiting to kick the ball after the referee\u2019s whistle was anathema to him. The other comes from Bert Hiddema, author of Cruijff! Van Jopie tot Johan. \u201cGood penalty-takers have a hard shot,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that was exactly what he lacked. At a young age he didn\u2019t have the strength [for it] and would instead use a curved kicking style, which was much more suitable for creative passing than penalties.\u201d \u201cJohan didn\u2019t do it himself,\u201d Rensenbrink told me. \u201cI think maybe he was frightened of missing.\u201d Rensenbrink was one of Holland\u2019s most reliable penalty-takers. He scored four out of four at the 1978 World Cup and was assiduous in his practice. He would take between 10 and 20 after every training session, sometimes telling the goalkeeper where he would aim before kicking, other times sticking poles half a metre inside each goalpost, and striking the ball in between the pole and the post every time. \u201cIt\u2019s like free-kicks, the more you take, the better you get. Saying you can\u2019t practise is bullshit. Just do it every day.\u201d \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to switch off when Cruyff talks about penalties,\u201d wrote the Dutch journalist Auke Kok. \u201cThe only question is: who would dare do such a thing? Because [usually] even if the truth bears little resemblance to what he says, everyone blindly accepts it.\u201d So here\u2019s some advice to Holland before the Mexico game. Do not listen to Cruyff when he says you cannot practise for penalties. Of course you can. The Dutch players need to practise, and with purpose, for that stripped-down moment of pure football \u2013 just ball, kicker, goal and goalkeeper \u2013 that might decide their fate.

The marriage is more arrangement than love match, and for Nella, a country girl, Johannes and his household are an alarming prospect: his waspish sister, Marin, terrifies her half to death, and she finds it hard to lift her eyes from the startling sight of his manservant, Otto, a former slave. Johannes does not come to her at night, and his wedding gift is a cabinet house \u2013 an exquisitely diminutive replica of his own property \u2013 which he now invites Nella to fill with miniature furniture at his expense. Lonely, she longs for the company of her parakeet, Peebo, but he has been confined by Marin to the kitchen, the sudden absence of his bright feathers symbolising the puritan repression at work in the wider city. Thanks to its Calvinist burgomasters, the people of Amsterdam eat their sugar in secret, and are forbidden to own dolls or any other replicas of the human form. Not exactly a fun town for\u00a0a marzipan lover with a cabinet house in\u00a0need of tiny new inhabitants. What follows for Nella is a series of puzzles. How does the miniaturist she commissions to make, among other things, a tiny lute for her cabinet, know so much about her and the other members of the Brandt household? And what are the secrets that Johannes and Marin are trying so hard to keep? Luckily, our heroine is not at all the timorous type she seemed at first to be, and she takes the ensuing revelations \u2013 they come thick and fast, in the manner of biblical thunderbolts \u2013 if not exactly on the chin, then with a great deal more aplomb than you might expect. Nella, it soon becomes apparent, has a sensibility more akin to that of a 21st-century teenager than a 17th-century one: outspoken, determined, reflexively feminist. Right from the moment she receives it, she regards the cabinet house as &quot;monument to her powerlessness, her arrested womanhood&quot; \u2013 though as the reader will soon discover, even this bracing modernity is as nothing compared with her radically sympathetic attitude to human sexuality. The Miniaturist has a singular and vivid setting, and by rights it should beguile utterly. Jessie Burton \u2013 this is her first novel, and it comes with a great deal of hype, having been sold in 30 countries \u2013 has clearly done a lot of research; she has even given us a glossary. But for all its conceits and ingenuity, for all the lovely passages to be found among its pages, somehow it fails to convince. Again and again, I found myself thinking: that would not happen. We are expected to take so much on trust. Why, for instance, is Nella able to move around Amsterdam unchaperoned? Even feminism doesn&apos;t make a woman invisible. Why, towards the end of the novel, does she think longingly of all the thrilling conversations she and Johannes have enjoyed? The reader will feel they have barely been in the same room for more than five minutes. I had the sense that the novel&apos;s characters were simply figures (from a doll&apos;s house, perhaps) to be moved around on an Amsterdam-shaped board. We know their tastes, but little of what lies in their hearts; we know all about their failings, but their motivation remains elusive. Emotionally, they move from A\u00a0to Z in the blink of an eye, and nothing in between. The result is curious: a narrative that throbs alluringly with what its minor characters (if not its major ones) consider to be sin, but whose temperature rests stubbornly at\u00a0lukewarm.

The Schalke midfielder and team-mate Sulley Muntari were expelled from the Ghana squad on the day of their final match against Portugal after Boateng was accused of making \u201cvulgar verbal insults\u201d towards coach James Appiah. Muntari was also accused of an \u201cunprovoked physical attack\u201d on a member of the Ghana FA, with both players asked to leave the camp before the 2-1 defeat to Portugal in Bras\u00edlia which consigned them to bottom spot in Group G. Boateng \u2013 who only returned to the Black Stars\u2019 set-up last year having retired from international football after the last World Cup \u2013 is now back at his home in Germany. In an interview with newspaper Bild published on Sunday, he accuses the GFA of having failed to live up to promises it made to him before the tournament. \u201cEverything \u2013 the hotels, the flights \u2013 everything was amateurish,\u201d he said. \u201cThe GFA president visited me in Milan begging me to play for Ghana again. He gave me his word that we would have better travel, better organisation and preparation. He has not kept his word. In the end I was just still dissatisfied. \u201cIt was a nightmare from the first day of the preparation to the end,\u201d Boateng added. \u201cWe flew to the first training camp from Amsterdam to Miami. However, we travelled in two groups, since there was no space. One group flew through Atlanta, the other New York. We sat for around nine hours at the airport - a total of 19 hours on the road. \u201cThe flight from Miami to Brazil a week later took 12 hours and we sat and concentrated in economy class. The legs ached. It sounds strange for an average citizen, but for a competitive athlete that is a disgrace. The Ghana FA president sat in business class with his wife and two children. And then in Brazil, we finally had a charter flight but my luggage was lost. Two days without football boots \u2013 it was a disaster.\u201d Appiah was the first homegrown coach to lead Ghana to a World Cup. But asked his opinion on whether he had a clue about tactics, Boateng gave a less than ringing endorsement. \u201cNo. But I have respect for him [as a] person,\u201d he said. \u201cI have always behaved positively. But if someone asks me about him, whether he is a good coach, I\u2019d say no.\u201d Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama spoke with captain Asamoah Gyan on the telephone to resolve a dispute over player bonuses ahead of the Portugal match, with $3m in cash flown to Brazil on a private jet. However, Boateng claimed that was only the tip of the iceberg in terms of issues that dogged the squad. He said: \u201cThat was the smallest problem. Everything had accumulated over a month. It was pure disaster. Poor training conditions and sleep options, I just wonder where all the money was flowing too. \u201cThe association get so much money from sponsors and Fifa - it was certainly not used for hotels, flights, the team and the preparation.\u201d Boateng also insisted that there was a lack of team spirit among the squad in direct contrast to the last World Cup in South Africa, when Ghana came within a missed penalty of becoming the first African nation to reach the semi-final. \u201cWe were not a real team. Everyone was busy with themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were two or three players who were just glad Sulley Muntari and I were suspended. They said it to my face. We all know that I have never insulted the coach. Nevertheless, they have turned the manager against Sulley and me. I am very calm and relaxed, because I definitely know that I did no such thing. \u201cI have represented my opinion. There was no player who was happy. We had 100 meetings with the delegation.

He calls La Commedia &quot;a film opera in five parts&quot;, for like the his stage works, Rosa (1995) and Writing to Vermeer (1999), which were both collaborations with Peter Greenaway, he conceived and composed it with a film-maker, in this case Hal Hartley. Hartley not only shot the video footage that is projected during the performance, but also made a film of the production, which is included on a DVD packaged with these CDs of the premiere. As the title signals, La Commedia is based on Dante, though by no means as a linear distillation of The Divine Comedy. It&apos;s more a series of reflections on his great work, five tableaux, dramatic cantatas almost, focusing on particular episodes, including the City of Dis, a portrait of Lucifer, the Garden of Earthly Delights and a final Luce Etterna. The text combines passages from the original (in Italian, English and Dutch translations), with extracts from the Old Testament and biblical plays by the 17th-century Dutch writer Joos van den Vondel. The tone is wonderfully varied \u2013 sometimes profoundly serious, sometimes wildly exuberant or irreverent \u2013 matched to a score that is equally diverse and eclectic. As always with Andriessen&apos;s orchestras, woodwind and brass outmuscle the strings, while piano and cimbalom give extra bite to the sonorities; there are winding Stravinskian chorales, intimidating chordal progressions and slithering ostinatos, as well as allusions to three centuries of composers from Bach onwards, while the Garden of Earthly Delights veers between jazz and an Italian folk ballad, before ending up in tongue-in-cheek Hollywood schmaltz. The performance with Reinbert de Leeuw conducting the combined Asko and Sch\u00f6nberg ensembles is superb: Dante&apos;s narrations are given to a mezzo, the fabulously versatile Cristina Zavalloni; Beatrice is a soprano, the fearless Claron McFadden, and the monologue by Dante&apos;s great-great grandfather Cacciaguida in the final tableau is turned into a kind of Dutch rap delivered by the late Jeroen Willems.

We had traveled by bus from Chefchauen, a well known cannabis producing region, to the capital, Rabat, and it had been a rather long uncomfortable journey. It was made a lot worse by the fact that for the last couple of days i had had a rather &quot;loose&quot; stomach.  We got to the airport with about forty minuted until our flight took off, so we rushed through check in, changed what little money we had left, pushed to the front of the passport queue and then tried to get through security. At that point, we were rather flushed from all the rushing, and I, more than I previously thought was possible, needed the toilet.  Inevitably, the guy in security pulled us to one side to take a closer look at our bags. And after emptying everything decided he should get another security guard to take a further look. I then made the mistake of telling him that I very much would like to go to the toilet while we waited because i had quite a bad stomach. He asked if i had taken any thing to which i replied, i have -- some Imodium -- but it hadn't helped. He then asked if i needed to have a doctor to check out my stomach, I said that i was OK, I just really needed to toilet. I then realised that we had very different understandings of what was wrong. Telling me that he knew that I came to the airport from Chefchauen - he must have checked my exit visa or guessed - he suggested that my bad stomach might be something to do with all the drugs I had taken or was smuggling in my stomach. I was looked nervous he told me. I tried to explain that I needed the loo. At that point, out came two armed police officers with sniffer dogs, and we were dragged to the corner of security and we waited, confident if a little nervous, for them to check out our bags.  I then got taken to an interview room, where a police officer poked at my stomach while quizzing me about my drug consumption habits. I told him that &quot;of course there is cannabis in Chefcauen&quot; -- you get offered it all the time -- but &quot;of course i didn't take any.&quot; He then said, after a little conferring, that I I would have to wait while they found a doctor to &quot;examine me.&quot; I tried to explain, once more, that this was a big misunderstanding and I just needed to go to the toilet but the more I remonstrated the more it seemed inevitable that i would end up with a latex gloved hand exploring my most intimate parts.  We waited, my girlfriend in tears; the police now were giggling and taking what seemed to be a remarkable amount of joy from our misery. Eventually somebody arrived to examine me: the original security officers. I asked about their medical credentials but i was told i didn't have a choice. Round the corner I went with him. We stopped outside a disabled toilet and he pointed to the door. Finally! I thought. And then it became obvious that the disabled toilets were in fact the examining room and he was coming in with me. He then told me that he was going to check if i was lying or not and told me that if i needed to go i should go now in a rather threatening tone, although he might have just been pissed off that he had drawn the short-straw of watching me defecate.  I was just about to ask if he could leave me alone while i went, but i no longer cared. Down came my trousers, and while I enjoyed an explosive, thundering poo, my bottom turning temporarily into an aerosol of faeces, i looked up at him and with a smug smile that said &quot;well i did tell you.&quot; After a minute or so, he left me to it. And by the time i returned my girlfriend was packing our bags once more, still a little shaken and uncertain as to where they had taken me.  The plane ended up being delayed, so we even got our flight. But it's taught me a lot. There are always bastard cops where ever you are; learning your rights is up there with remembering your passport; and make sure you carry money in case you need to bribe somebody in a disabled toilet in an airport in order to get home.

Going through the security scanner I was called back by one of the police security hovering around at the end who handed me a pair of magnifying glasses that were sitting at the end of the conveyor belt where I'd just picked my handbag up. I said thank you and wandered off with my family and a friend to the cafe. About 15 minutes later my brother said &quot;I think those three annoyed looking policemen are pointing at you&quot;!  It seems I'd mistakenly taken the glasses that belonged to someone else by mistake (I did honestly have a pair with me, I thought they'd fallen out my bag) and he was standing there with the policemen who came over to our table and started pointing and gesticulating at me and the glasses. I don't speak Spanish, neither did anyone else with me, the whole cafe was silent and staring at us but fortunately, the chap whose glasses I'd accidentally taken was German and did speak Spanish, he also spoke excellent English. He was very nice and accepted my massively red-faced apology that I truly had taken them by accident and left with the three policemen who glared at me as they departed.

The next day we noticed that my friend's connecting flight in London to Newcastle was wrong - they had booked her connection a YEAR after she landed at LHR.  The LAN office in Cusco was closed for Easter, so we tried to alter the ticket online (it was a BA, One World alliance ticket) but no joy. Unfazed we flew from Cusco to Lima to catch our flight to the UK thinking we could sort this out with LAN at Lima. Hahahahaa... Three hours - and one shift change - later, we were still arguing with LAN about the error. They were adamant they would not change it, despite seeing that the original connection was the same day and that their colleague had made the mistake!  Frustrated at the complete ineptitude of LAN, and with a very angry, shouty best mate losing her rag ('I HATE THIS COUNTRY') I decided to do what all good PAs do: sort it out. I hopped online and booked my friend a BMi flight to Newcastle, I then called British Airways. It was not cheap, however, I got a very nice lady in the UK who took note of my issue, that we had spent more money on a flight, and that we were displeased. Ah, Britain.  It took 4 months of letters to get the flight connection refunded and an apology from LAN, however.....she got home!!

He never turned up - his connecting plane from Heathrow was diverted to Porto when one of the other passengers had a cardiac arrest. He eventually met us at the hotel but had no luggage, which had been lost in transit at Heathrow. He waited the requisite 3 days without luggage before hitting the fashion shops to buy underwear etc. His plight gave us much amusement. On the way back the friend was travelling to Hong Kong as he'd been moved to that office. We waited for the EasyJet flight back to Basel as he boarded his HK flight in business class. Constant delayed messages alerted to us an issue with our flight and when we eventually took our seats we were 5 hours late. Basel won't allow landings after midnight. Easyjet decided to send us to Lyon instead (which the tannoy insisted &quot;is near Basel&quot; - it isn't). We got shunted on to a rickety bus at 2 a.m. and trundled to Basel, arriving exhausted at 07:50 a.m. (10 minutes before the deadline at which EasyJet would have owed us compensation). At this point I received a text from the friend who had headed off to Hong Kong. He had landed on time and had been seated next to Alice Cooper, a fascinating companion who was happy (over a large quantity of Jack Daniels &amp; coke) to share stories of classic albums and touring shenanigans.

It was a brief stopover of two or three hours, which I should have spent in the heat and grime of what the airport staff referred to, with a straight face, as the transit lounge.  Within a few minutes of arriving in said lounge, a man came up to me, flashed his police ID, and demanded to see my passport and ticket. After inspecting them, he put them in his pocket, and told me to follow him.  We went downstairs, out through customs and immigration without pausing, and into the airport police station. I was taken into an interrogation room, where we were joined by two of my new friend's colleagues.  They kindly offered to assist me, for a small fee, in boarding my flight, an offer I politely declined on the grounds my ticket was in order. They then offered, in exchange for a similar consideration, to ensure that my checked baggage was loaded onto the plane, and again I thanked them very much, but said I was sure everything would be fine. At one point, I said I had little cash, but they told me they accepted travellers cheques. This dance went on for hours, with all of us pretending the officers weren't demanding bribes to let me go, and my stubbornly refusing to take advantage of their offers of assistance. Eventually, my plane landed, and they gave up.  I found myself at the bottom of the 747's steps, arguing with cabin crew, who, understandably, weren't keen to let me board without a passport or ticket. Eventually, a police officer shambled across the tarmac and returned my documents. It was only when I settled into my seat that I realised what a fool I'd been. What felt at the time like a game -- which I'd won! -- could have caused me real problems. For the sake of \u00a320 (though that really was a lot to me back then), I'd risked missing my plane, and possibly spending time in a Zairian jail. How long would it have taken the British consul to discover I was missing -- and then find me? What might have happened to me in my cell during that time?  But I was young, naive and it was my first time out of Europe. Thank God the on-board booze in cattle class was free back then. Otherwise, I'd have blown \u00a320 on getting drunk.

When we finally landed there was no gate available, so the plane was parked on the tarmac - coincidentally right next to the Frankfurt-San Francisco plane I was supposed to transfer to - and a bus came to shuttle us to an airport entrance. The bus naturally drove us as far away as it could, from where I sprinted the length of the airport, arriving at the gate just as the last passengers were boarding. The following conversation ensued: Agent: Which flight are you coming from?Self: Rome.Agent: I'm sorry sir, that flight has been delayed and you won't make the connection.Self: But I have made the connection - I'm here.

She was in her 70s, couldn't speak a word of English, spoke Mandarin with a strong accent and was illiterate. So we booked her into a direct flight and my parents and I (I was 7 then) waited dutifully at Heathrow for her to arrive.  Except her flight didn't arrive. At first it was labelled 'delayed'. This continued for hours. Then it just disappeared from the boards. My parents, with their broken English, were panicked. We slept on the floor in Heathrow airport that night as they struggled to locate the plane. The first of many nights I have since spent in airports and definitely the most scary.  Around 36 hours later we found out the plane had been held up somewhere and we, as Chinese people did in those days, sought the help of the Chinese Embassy. The Embassy actually provided us with accommodation for 2 further nights until my grandma arrived at Heathrow, 3 days late, but happy, healthy and completely unruffled and unconcerned.  She said she'd had a nice time with some ladies from another province in China who'd looked after her and we had nothing to worry about. She wasn't sure what had happened but they'd landed somewhere and she'd been given a place to stay and good food. She's even made good enough friends to give a few of the ladies our address, which my mum had written down for her. A few months later, we received a letter from one of these ladies with a photo of my grandma standing in front of St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow.  My grandma passed away in 2009. This is the main picture of her my parents still display on their mantelpiece.

Try being in a wheelchair. I have a story for every time I have flown with my power wheelchair, from the very helpful checkin lady in Vegas demanding that I try and walk (really? I'd never thought of that? Let me give it a go just for you), to the Paratransit bus that had a lift that failed with me inside the bus, as we're parked outside the airport and the departure time getting ever closer. However, there is one that will remain with us for all time. Flying from Vancouver Airport to Orlando for a massive family holiday. We are on the plane and the cabin crew ask my husband if he can step off the plane to talk to the ground staff. Nothing new here, we've been asked before to show them how to make sure the battery is off. My husband is gone for a little longer than I would have thought...and the cabin crew come back and ask for our address in Florida. Hmmmm. Not normal. My ashen faced husband gets back on the plane to tell me that they have dropped my $25k custom built power wheelchair from 20ft onto concrete and it is destroyed. And we're on our way to our holiday... To cut a very long story short, the holiday was painful - you can't just rent a replacement chair - so I mean literally painful with the chair that I had. It took 5 months before everything was finished. It was the airline's responsibility, but not their fault - Vancouver ground crew put it in a freight elevator without putting brakes on and leaving the back door of the elevator open. 350lb of chair flying through the air...could have killed someone. The airline, WestJet, were wonderful and did everything they could and I ended up with a lifelong friend from their mobility specialist in customer service. And they replaced the chair, without us ever having a crossed word anywhere in the proceedings. Has it put me off flying? Nah, flying again this year with WestJet. My mobility specialist friend already has the flights marked on her calendar...I've said I expect the chair to be wrapped in industrial strength bubble wrap! Your baggage is late?

Midwinter    01 July 2014 1:58pm   This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate So this would have been around 1990. It was Christmas Eve and I'd gone to Washington Dulles Airport to pick up my wife, who was flying in from LA (where she worked at the time). I don't know if you remember that winter, but it was a cold one, and the airport was virtually snowbound. Delays were expected. To amuse myself, I had a couple of drinks at the airport bar. While I was there I spotted what I thought was a dodgy looking character. Intrigued, I followed him into the baggage claim hall, where I was appalled to see that the man was both carrying a gun, and seemed to interfering with some baggage due to be loaded up onto one of the plans. I was armed myself, and -- as is common in these situations -- a shootout ensured, in which I killed one of the men. On reporting to airport security, I was appalled to discover that the man (whose ID I took) was a mercenary, supposedly killed in action a few years back. As you can imagine, I was even more suspicious than ever. Well, my suspicions were proved correct. Not long after that, a terrorist cell seized control of air traffic control and threatened to crash planes into the ground unless the dictator of their South American homeland -- then in jail in the US on drug charges -- was released from custody. To their credit, airport security called in SWAT to try and take the terrorists out, but it was a disaster. The SWAT team were massacred, and the terrorists went ahead and crashed a plane into the runway. There was over 200 people on board! Really, it was a bit of a downer. Anyway, realising my wife was in danger and that the authorities weren't going to solve the situation, I took matters into my own hands. To cut a long story short, I found the terrorists, killed them all and blew up their plane. Then I ran out onto the runway in the snow, and hailed down the remaining planes, saving thousands. The irony is that just the previous year I'd had to deal with a similar terrorist threat at my wife's workplace in LA. I mean, honestly, how can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?

Where once this stretch of road had symbolised freedom and modernity when it opened in 1975, it meant only terror to us as we sat, millimetres off the ground, in a low-slung, British Leyland-built Triumph cabriolet, as old as the road but in far worse condition. The car had been fine as a city runabout; here, it was doomed. An articulated lorry blared angrily at us and we darted for the nearest exit. Our 60-second ordeal by road underlined a basic truth: that the kind of slow-moving mixed traffic that has become the lifeblood of a city has no place on a high-speed motorway. Which is either a reason to drive motorways deep into the heart of cities, or to banish them altogether.  From the 1940s until the 1970s, the political consensus across developed economies was clear: dedicated highways equipped with grade-separated interchanges were the only way to keep city traffic moving. But urban motorways offered more than that: to many, they symbolised progress and dynamism in a world determined to bulldoze its past. Thus the 1945 City of Manchester Plan called for a concentric ring road system and the demolition of the now-listed Town Hall in the interests of increasing parking space. Of those ring roads, only the M60 was ever built, leaving the Mancunian Way as Manchester\u2019s one true urban motorway. But in Birmingham, Herbert Manzoni, another planner with no time for the past, prevailed and got his Inner Ring Road. If Manchester\u2019s orbital grew hesitantly and in fits and starts around the city territory, Birmingham\u2019s tore out bloody chunks of the core in one determined operation running from 1957 to 1971. For its critics, the nadir of this project was Masshouse Circus, a roundabout that created a dense, depressed circle of concrete packed with parked cars and overlooked by tower blocks. Gloomy subways shunned by more timid pedestrians added to the road\u2019s isolating effect.     The M6 passes through Birmingham, a city whose core was torn up to make way for more motorway in the 1950s and \u201960s. Photograph: Pat Savage/Alamy    If the M60 feels bleak because of its grey, windswept setting, the Embarcadero Freeway felt bleak in spite of it. Soaring some 17 metres above the Port of San Francisco on squat concrete piers, this two-level highway appears to have done its best to blight both the natural and the urban environment. Built in 1959, it blocked views of both the bay area and the historic ferry terminal, cloaking the waterfront in a grimy wet blanket of neglect and underdevelopment. Again the highway formed a wall that was unpleasant if not impossible to cross: according to architectural writer William Thompson, it \u201cshunted pedestrians through a dark, sooty gauntlet between downtown and the San Francisco Bay\u201d. The same mindset that gave Birmingham its ring road imposed the Embarcadero on San Francisco, Harbor Drive on Portland, Oregon and many more: an estimated total of nearly 6,500 kilometres of urban freeway had been built in the United States by 1976, just twenty years after President Eisenhower signed off funding for the interstate highway system. By then, the tide of popular and political opinion had turned. In 1969, a book by engineer JJ Leeming explained that highway building was leading to induced demand, in which adding capacity simply encouraged more traffic and more miles of congested roads. When a junior transport minister called Michael Heseltine opened the Westway, a partly elevated motorway in London in July 1970, he was greeted by protesters mobbing his car and banners on houses lining the new route that read \u201cGet us out of this hell.\u201d Three years later, with cost estimates and public hostility mounting, the Greater London Council abandoned plans to build further motorways. The following year, in 1974, Portland began to demolish Harbor Drive, replacing it with a boulevard and park dotted with cherry blossom. Where Portland led, others followed: San Francisco eventually demolished the Embarcadero Freeway in 1991. \u201cPeople thought it would be Carmageddon,\u201d says Peter Park, a city planner and evangelist for urban highway demolition. \u201cIf you go to the waterfront today, you\u2019ll see beautiful development \u2026 It\u2019s not that the cars disappeared, they found a different route.\u201d Birmingham too has since got rid of most of its urban motorways.     Graffiti under the Westway; an urban motorway that has no time for pedestrians. Photograph: Andrea Heselton/Alamy    Like Birmingham\u2019s Inner Ring Road, the Westway \u2013 that elevated stretch of dual carriageway rising from Paddington into central London \u2013 resists domestication. It is impossible to walk on, near or around: it was not meant for pedestrians, and it shows in the disconnected local road network and lack of pedestrian subways. The gritty feel is not unremittingly unpleasant in my view \u2013 it even complements the atmosphere in the skate park and Parkour centre that flourish underneath it \u2013 but it is a hardening influence. Small wonder that JG Ballard chose the newly built Westway as the setting of his 1974 novella Concrete Island, in which a well-off architect is transformed into a savage outlaw by the dehumanising effects of being stranded in a motorway knot. When humans and concrete collide, the result is usually drama. For me, childhood overland road trips to Spain via France meant exciting dives into city tunnels, a briefly glimpsed exotic netherworld gloomily lit in those pre-LED lighting days by orange sodium lamps. One such tunnel, built underneath Madrid\u2019s Azca financial district in the 1970s, jacks up the surrealism of Pedro Almodovar\u2019s 1988 film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown when it forms the backdrop to a chase scene involving a murderous jilted wife on a Harley-Davidson, a gazpacho-drenched mistress and a ludicrously coiffed taxi driver. Yet despite being unfashionable and discredited, cities the world over continue to build urban motorways. Many such schemes, such as Santiago\u2019s Vespucio Oriente, will be built in a tunnel (expensively) to avoid carving up neighbourhoods, but as recently as 2011, the Scottish government inaugurated the final stretch of the M74 in Glasgow, linking up with the M8 and M73 to create the inner ring that London planners once dreamed of. Like the interstates, it was partly built to revive traditionally depressed areas, and as it cuts through the city\u2019s South Side it restores a touch of Brutalism to the redeveloped Gorbals, which painting the steel underside sky blue (as they have done) can scarcely soften. Even the cycling nirvana of Amsterdam demands motorways. The Dutch government plans to expand the A10 motorway in the south of the city from eight lanes to 12, and to bury it under an expanded public transport interchange. Both Scottish and Dutch officials insist that their motorways are sustainable, though without a takedown of the arguments against (neither was willing to be interviewed on the subject) it\u2019s not clear how. For now, Transport Scotland says that the new road has taken cars off the previously congested M8 and reduced journey times. In the long run, its own figures show that CO2 emissions are forecast to increase as a result of the M74.     A motorway in Amsterdam. Although known as a cycling nirvana, the Dutch city plans to widen the A10 highway to 12 lanes. Photograph: Horizons WWP/Alamy    Is there anything to recommend urban motorways? Peter Park is adamant there is not: \u201cThere\u2019s no city that hasn\u2019t gotten better when a highway came out of it.\u201d Anyway, he argues, it is not true to say that \u201ccongestion is always a bad thing\u201d. But congestion certainly drives up fuel emissions, and London, which is relatively short on urban motorways, has noticeably worse air pollution than flyover-happy Glasgow. The solution, if one exists, is surely to combine a limited highway system, preferably below ground if affordable, with some of the growing toolkit of technologies that penalise unnecessary journeys and promote free flowing traffic. Congestion charging is one; smart motorways with variable speed limits, currently being rolled out on the British highway network, are another. Which may explain why London is coming round to the idea after all. Mayor Boris Johnson, who has decried the Westway in the past, is mulling a multibillion-pound new orbital tunnel to submerge the current inner ring road deep underground. Some kind of demand management measures, such as variable tolling linked to traffic levels, seem inevitable, and Boris\u2019s office promises that road space on the surface would be reclaimed for the public good.  In his book On Roads, Joe Moran notes that the 1950s motorway builders weren\u2019t stupid or reckless: they genuinely thought motorways would solve the congestion problem. Combining some of their engineering zeal with intelligent charging systems might just give us the economic benefit of fast travel with the cash flows to pay for it \u2013 and to bury it out of sight. \u2022 \u2018In a successful modern city, the car must no longer be king\u2019", "sentences": ["Even the cycling nirvana of Amsterdam demands motorways.", "A motorway in Amsterdam."], "title": "Congestion-beaters or roads to hell: is there still a place for urban motorways?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jul/08/congestion-roads-hell-urban-motorways", "tags": ["Cities", "Road transport", "Transport policy", "Transport", "UK news", "Motoring", "Motoring", "Congestion charging"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-08T12:38:00Z", "article": "Why are Airbnb under attack from the authorities?Airbnb provides an online platform to allow individuals to rent out their homes, rooms or apartments to visitors.

In Berlin \u2013 where Airbnb has been partly blamed for increasing rents \u2013 city officials have created a new housing law banning regular short-term letting of rooms without permission from the authorities, something that could have a big impact on the number of Airbnb hosts in the city. In response to the Barcelona ruling Airbnb said: &quot;Barcelona should stay on the cutting edge of innovation, and we&apos;re disappointed to see a ruling that affects a number of companies and that will hold the city back. Regarding our particular case, while we review this decision and consider our legal options, we will continue to provide robust information about the rules in Barcelona, and require all Airbnb hosts to follow those rules.&quot;     Airbnb has proved incredibly popular with young professionals  on city breaks. Photograph: Todd Selby for the Guardian    Is everywhere so hostile?Not all city authorities are reacting to Airbnb so negatively. In February Amsterdam became the first city to pass an &quot;Airbnb-friendly law&quot;, when new legislation was created \u2013 with the sharing economy in mind \u2013 that permits residents to rent out their homes for up to two months of the year to up to four people at a time. However, the owner will have to pay the relevant taxes, including tourist tax. Earlier this year a bill was also passed in France legalising short term rentals of primary residences - great for Airbnb in Paris. The UK government has also been supportive; last month Eric Pickles, secretary of communities and local government, announced reforms that would scrap rules preventing homeowners from renting their properties on sites such as Airbnb. &quot;The internet is changing the way we work and live, and the law needs to catch up,&quot; said Pickles. How has Airbnb responded? Airbnb has continued to argue the benefits they provide to cities and their residents; for example, by citing the financial benefits home rental offers to hard up citizens. In the case of Barcelona, one study cited by the company found that 75% of those renting homes out through Airbnb have incomes below the national average. In New York, Airbnb has been battling hard through the courts, as well as engaging in an aggressive PR campaign that has seen it launch a city-specific website that states &quot;New Yorkers support Airbnb&quot; and, more recently, sponsoring the New York marathon. It&apos;s key spokesperson is David Hantman, who was hired as head of global public policy in late 2012 \u2013 an appointment clearly made in response to mounting legislative pressure against the company. Aware of the need to adapt, in April Airbnb updated its terms of service to make its users more aware of local laws and taxes, emphasising the host&apos;s responsibilities to comply to them. Of course, in reality, most hosts have not been charging their guests hotel tax, let alone paying it to the city. To address this, in some jurisdictions Airbnb have begun taking care of collecting hotel tax on the hosts behalf, meaning prices in some places will go up. As of July 1, the company has been adding 11.5% hotel tax to all reservations made in Portland, Oregon, and it has also begun collecting taxes in San Francisco. And the company is trying to negotiate a similar arrangement in New York.     Definitely not couch surfing: a loft apartment in Brooklyn available on Airbnb. Photograph: Andreas Serna for the Guardian    Could I get in trouble for renting my home through Airbnb?It depends on local laws, but there could be a risk of fines from the city authorities or, more likely, getting on the wrong side of your landlord. In San Francisco, where all short-term residential rentals \u2013 be it a room or an entire property \u2013 are banned without applying for an expensive permit, some tenants who have used Airbnb to rent their apartment have been given notices of eviction. In New York there have been similar cases, since using Airbnb to sublet some or all of a property is often in breach of a tenancy agreement. Though perhaps the most depressing cases \u2013 which even Airbnb is opposed to \u2013 is when landlords evict long standing tenants in order to rent rooms out on the site. Could I get in trouble for staying at an illegal Airbnb property?Unless you happen to be staying there when the landlord comes round to evict the host, it&apos;s very unlikely. The laws currently being disputed apply to the hosts, who are required to confirm that they comply with the applicable local laws when they list their property on the site. As for when things go wrong, Airbnb offers a guest refund policy in the case of a last-minute cancellation from the host, or if the property is misrepresented, although guests have to notify Airbnb within 24 hours. We contacted Airbnb to find out whether travel insurance claims would be affected if you are renting accommodation that is not complying with local laws. It responded that they &quot;recommend that people take the same precautions as they would using any other type of accommodation on a trip - ie use common sense when looking after valuables, take out travel insurance and check the policy details for any exceptions that might apply.&quot;", "sentences": ["In February Amsterdam became the first city to pass an &quot;Airbnb-friendly law&quot;, when new legislation was created \u2013 with the sharing economy in mind \u2013 that permits residents to rent out their homes for up to two months of the year to up to four people at a time."], "title": "Airbnb's legal troubles: what are the issues?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jul/08/airbnb-legal-troubles-what-are-the-issues", "tags": ["Travel", "Airline industry", "Travel websites", "Bed and breakfasts", "Technology", "Business", "Airbnb"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-08T12:58:00Z", "article": "Distortion of the debate The greatest danger facing our democracy is the ability of the public relations community to distort debate by corrupting the meaning of words. When country A invades country B and its inhabitants fight back, as they have every right to do under any conceivable international law, they become &quot;the resistance&quot;. An &quot;insurgent&quot; is defined as one who surges in. Thus, when the US army surged into Iraq in 2003 they became insurgents and the Iraqis who fought back became resistance fighters. While the Guardian has not sunk to the level of idiocy inherent in PR phrases like &quot;clean coal&quot;, you persist in getting this the wrong way round (Iraqis once craved unity, 20 June). Would you favour rewriting the history of the second world war to discuss the French insurgency?Graham AndrewsSpokane, Washington, US Apply diplomatic pressure  Facing Shia-Sunni bloodletting in Syria and Iraq, US President Barack Obama has rightly rejected any military intervention and the majority of Americans are opposed to any intervention. Michael Cohen quotes Obama saying &quot;some of our most costly mistakes came not from our restraint, but from our willingness to rush into military adventures without thinking through the consequences&quot; (No mood in US for a fight, 20 June). However, the world cannot sit by and let the Shias and the Sunnis slaughter each other. The US should use its leverage over Iraq&apos;s Shia prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, to pressure him to extend moderate Sunnis a share in the Shia-led government, which Obama is already doing. He can also use the newfound negotiation with Iran to prod the Iranian leaders to pressure Bashar al-Assad to extend similar sharing of power with the Sunnis in Syria. Obama should also persuade Saudi Arabia to stop supplying arms and financial support to the Sunni extremists. It seems both Iran and Saudi Arabia are conducting a proxy war against each other through their surrogates in the Middle East. Obama has rightly chosen not to intervene militarily in Iraq and Syria. But he cannot let the Shias and Sunnis slaughter each other in the name of religion.Mahmood ElahiOttawa, Canada Dogma and incompetence Will Hutton, in Obsessed with reform of the NHS (27 June), exposed the fallacious thinking behind the modern panacea of corporatisation for perceived inefficiencies in public institutions such as the NHS. These fallacies arise as a consequence of: 1) a preoccupation with party dogma based on half-baked economic theory and the vested interest of other influential sectors, coupled with 2) sheer incompetence. Everybody remembers Sir Humphrey, but we tend to forget that Westminster included Jim Hacker. Economists from Adam Smith onwards have touted hypotheses dressed up as theories with general validity as if they were holy writ. Such treatment is inappropriate for highly complex social systems. These require a more pragmatic approach involving clearly defined objectives, thorough investigation of the means of achieving them, and continual review to improve their efficiency in the light of experience and new knowledge. To cure the ills of both our bodies and our institutions, we should only resort to amputation as a last resort but, in public life at least, the barber-surgeon appears to be making a comeback.David BarkerBunbury, Western Australia Sport is expensive Sir Michael Wilshaw misses the point when he thinks that the problem of few top British sportspeople coming from state schools lies with the schools (Playing field is hardly level, 27 June). To become a top athlete in most sports requires about 10,000 hours of training. We have to charge \u00a34.50 ($7.70) minimum for a one-and-a-half hour recreational session. Those starting to show promise would need to do maybe six hours a week (\u00a318). Those training at a higher level may need 15-20 hours a week \u2013 and so the costs rise. Add to this costs of equipment, competition entry, travel and accommodation at competitions and squads and you are left with only the children of rich parents. Grants that cover all this are only available once you have become a top athlete. Local grants to promising juniors maybe reach \u00a3100, which goes nowhere. We try to pay our coaches \u2013 and half the costs of their training, but this is becoming prohibitive as the cost of the lowest level of qualification is over \u00a3300, the second level over \u00a3500 and the third level over \u00a31,000. Sport is rapidly becoming only for the rich. What is amazing is that anyone from state schools manages to become a top athlete.Catherine PageBirkenhead, UK Cameron is wrong on EU How can prime minister David Cameron claim there is a democratic deficit in the European Union (4 July)? How can he accuse the European parliament of having no legitimacy and being involved in a power grab when it votes on the head of the commission? Each one of the 700-odd MEPs has been elected by a citizen of the EU. What&apos;s more, this has been done only very recently. Cameron, in fact, has never been elected as prime minister. Unlike France, for example, Britons do not elect their leader. He is prime minister because a coalition of Lib Dems and Conservatives, the biggest group in the British parliament, wants it to be so. In the EU parliament the biggest coalition is the centre right, which wishes Jean-Claude Juncker to be leader of the commission. How is that in any way different to the process that produced Cameron as British PM?Mike OwenBlandford, UK Flesh-and-blood reality Simon Jenkins&apos;s piece on how technology has not replaced flesh-and-blood experiences (27 June) harks back to the old science-fiction scenario of robots obsessed with seeking the human qualities they lack, as in the theory that robotic aliens have come to earth and retrieved samples of our flesh in an attempt to replicate our &quot;power of live&quot;, as Jenkins quotes the latest California mot du jour.

It&apos;s hard to see any advantage in flying from Luxembourg to Amsterdam. Train would be faster and without the time-wasting airport and security procedures. Container-ships are polluting \u2013 but less so than aircraft \u2013 and they are going to operate anyway. I have, over 22 years, travelled nearly two dozen times by container ship. I have no guilty conscience about this, since for those with time to spare there is no greener option.Alaisdair RaynhamTruro, UK Briefly \u2022 Once again the Guardian refers to Narendra Modi&apos;s landslide victory (27 June). This is deceiving and propagates a myth that politicians love. Modi got 31% of the vote: that is not a landslide, it is a minority. It is only because of the peculiar way that votes in the British electoral system are converted into parliamentary seats that it seems that he won. It is not democracy.

Everyone from central bankers to anarchist cypherpunks has queued up to give their five pence worth on the &quot;decentralised online currency&quot;, as the US Treasury describes it. So is Bitcoin the greater leveller that many claim? Or is it, as others argue, an unruly upstart that threatens to send the monetary system into chaos? Upside Let&apos;s start with the positive. Bitcoin works as a pretty effective medium of exchange (see this video for the basics). As a digital currency, it effectively bypasses the intermediary role of banks, with their expensive credit cards and high processing costs. That makes online transactions smoother and cheaper, as well as providing more flexibility for financing projects. &quot;The banks have held back innovation in money for so long. So the fact that there are discussions in Silicon Valley about payment systems like Bitcoin has to be a good thing,&quot; says David Boyle, an independent specialist in alternative economics and author of Funny Money. The fact of direct exchange bodes well for internet entrepreneurs and traditional businesses too. Right now, if you design a high-transaction business that requires online payments in tiny amounts \u2013 say 1p or less \u2013 bank charges make it a non-starter. Bitcoin changes that. People like Bitcoin for political reasons too. That&apos;s mostly because it sticks two fingers up to governments and the central banks beholden to them. Instead, Bitcoin generates its own money. Google &apos;cryptographic hash function&apos; and you&apos;ll quickly get a feel for the basic nuts and bolts of how the process works. But for most Bitcoin advocates, the specifics are less important than the principle: the decentralisation (and democratisation) of money supply is what wins the digital currency a thumbs-up, not the complex algorithmic computations underpinning it. Downsides The downsides, however, are only too apparent. Stories abound about how the high-profile digital currency is the coinage of choice for the &apos;darknet&apos;, used for everything from arms running to money laundering. The closure last year of Silk Road, an online narcotics marketplace beloved of Bitcoin users, hit the reputation of the digital currency hard. Being unregulated and exclusively online, the currency is vulnerable to theft too. Gone are the days of muggers knocking you on the head and stealing your purse. Now they just need to hack your Bitcoin account. The MtGox hack is perhaps the best known, partly because it sent the value of the currency plunging but also because the hackers had the cheek to try it again. But there are plenty of other examples too. Bitcoin suffers two other major downsides, neither of them headline-grabbers but important nonetheless. First, the idea of an alternative currency isn&apos;t that new. Recent decades have seen waves of other examples, says Leander Bindewald, a currency expert at the New Economics Foundation, a London-based think tank. Think Local Exchange Trading Systems in the 1980s, Time Banking in the 90s, and &quot;transition currencies&quot; such as the Brixton Pound or online community exchange systems more recently. Nor is Bitcoin actually that unique. Dogecoin, Litecoin, Darkcoin, Namecoin, Peercoin and a myriad of other cryptocurrencies like them are all based on a similar premise and adopt similar technologies. It&apos;s just the narrative around Bitcoin \u2013 its mysterious founder, its claims to disruption, its decision to set the total issuance of Bitcoins at a fixed amount, and so on \u2013 that cause it to stand out, Bindewald claims. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of discussion now about how Bitcoin is interesting as a payment mechanism and a governance paradigm. But the currency that everyone knows is pretty uninteresting \u2013 it&apos;s just a proof of concept that the payment mechanism and governance paradigm actually work,&quot; he adds. Sustainable alternatives The arguments around Bitcoin will rumble on. But, from a sustainable finance perspective, is it worth the fuss? If you&apos;re looking for an alternative currency system that will drive a transition towards sustainability, then there are plenty of better places to start than Bitcoin. Take e-portemonnee, an e-wallet system currently being piloted in Belgium. The system, which is run by Limburg.net, an inter-municipal waste disposal company, sees local residents gain discounts at municipal facilities in exchange for reducing their waste and other environmental actions. Or consider an approach being experimented with in the French city of Nantes. Last year, local bank Cr\u00e9dit Municipal de Nantes issued a pilot currency in conjunction with the municipal authority for exclusive use in the area. The digital currency is designed to facilitate business between participating companies as well as trade with any individual who is part of the scheme. SoNantes is regulated by a mutual credit system, with users&apos; credits and debits tracked online and then settled after a set period. Other sustainability-focused pilot currencies to look out for include TradeQoin (for trade between SMEs), Amsterdam-based Makkie (for promoting community involvement) and the UK time credit scheme Spice (for encouraging community-led development). The dominance of physical cash as an instrument of exchange is dwindling fast. Expect more and more alternative currencies to spring up. Bitcoin is enjoying its moment in the limelight \u2013 but it&apos;s not necessary the best, and definitely not the most sustainable. The finance hub is funded by EY.

The museum near Wakefield, spread out among 200 hectares (500 acres) of parkland, had modest beginnings, founded by Peter Murray in 1977 when he was principal lecturer in art history at Bretton Hall College and had the idea of putting some sculpture in the grounds. Today Murray is executive director of an organisation which is one of the world&apos;s most important open air museums, with 160 staff and 220 volunteers. Stephen Deuchar, director of the Art Fund and chair of judges, said YSP was &quot;a perfect fusion of art and landscape&quot; that had gone &quot;from modest beginning to one of the finest outdoor museums one might ever imagine&quot;. Last year was a particularly strong one for YSP with record visitor numbers and a successful exhibition of works by Yinka Shonibare; the restoration of an 18th-century chapel which then had as its first exhibit a new work by Ai Weiwei; and the installation of Roger Hiorns&apos; Seizure 2008/2013 \u2013 a copper sulphate chamber relocated from its initial home, a condemned London bedsit.

Hopeful of love, Nella is soon disappointed: Brandt is indifferent to her, his domineering sister terse and disdainful. Even the outspoken servants confound Nella&apos;s provincial expectations. Lonely and unoccupied, Nella is at first angered by her husband&apos;s extravagant wedding gift, a perfect facsimile of her new home in miniature, which she regards as a cruel joke, a mockery of her powerlessness in the household. However, her curiosity piqued by an advertisement, she commissions a miniaturist to create a few small items to furnish the house. The tiny creations she receives are not only exquisite, they bear an uncanny resemblance to their real-life counterparts, suggesting that the miniaturist knows every detail not only of the house itself but the secrets of its occupants. Jessie Burton&apos;s much-hyped debut, which has sparked a publishing feeding\u00a0frenzy across more than 30 markets, has been compared to Tracy Chevalier&apos;s Girl With a Pearl Earring. Like Chevalier, Burton is skilled at evoking place. The Amsterdam of her novel is an overripe empire on the brink of rot, the excesses of its prosperity uneasily at odds with its strict Calvinist sensibilities. It is a chilly, secretive city where citizens spy\u00a0on one another, outsiders are mistrusted and women wear their expensive jewels concealed in the folds\u00a0of their dresses. Burton&apos;s prose is\u00a0sometimes overwrought but more often she hits her mark: a dog moves through the shadows like &quot;spilled liquid&quot;, while the wife of Brandt&apos;s business associate &quot;swims in her great\u00a0skirts&quot; across a room, beautifully capturing both her importance and her impotence. Like Chevalier&apos;s Delft, Burton&apos;s Amsterdam is a city where a woman&apos;s realm is strictly domestic; where, as Nella&apos;s mother observes, &quot;life&apos;s hard if you&apos;re not a wife&quot;. The central premise of Burton&apos;s novel, inspired by Oortman&apos;s real\u2011life miniature house within a house, even smaller and more claustrophobic than the original, is therefore an intriguing one and rich with possibility. The three\u00a0women at the heart of her story, Nella, Brandt&apos;s sister Marin and the maidservant Cordelia, are all wholly dependent on\u00a0Brandt for their survival;\u00a0obliged to live together cheek\u00a0by jowl among the shadows of his grand house,\u00a0they must manage their own conflicting interests by stealth. The miniaturist, by contrast, is\u00a0a free spirit, an ethereally blond foreigner who not only defies Amsterdam&apos;s strict guild system to work at her\u00a0craft but, more shockingly still, lives alone like a common prostitute. It\u00a0is no coincidence that her house is at\u00a0the sign of the Sun. But what is she seeking as she shines her light into the dark corners of\u00a0the Brandts&apos; lives? Is she a spy, fixed on their downfall, or is she possessed of some kind of magical gift? Are her tiny creations prophecies of the future or, more disorientingly still, does their presence in the house make things happen? Most puzzling of\u00a0all, just whose side is she on? Such ingredients promise much but,\u00a0though there is plenty to enjoy in\u00a0The Miniaturist, the novel falls frustratingly short of its own potential. Part of this comes from a shift in pace about halfway through the book when\u00a0Burton, seeking to ratchet up tension, allows the mystery of the miniaturist to drift\u00a0from the narrative. Instead she\u00a0pursues a soap opera of a plot that\u00a0plunders the\u00a0stock tropes of domestic historical drama, leaving the\u00a0deeper questions she has raised largely unexplored. As events engulf them, the characters in The Miniaturist never quite convince. There are some wonderful set pieces, notably a strikingly affecting trial, but\u00a0while Burton is meticulous in exposing their human failings she is less successful at showing us their hearts: too often they act to serve the\u00a0plot rather than create it. As for Nella, unlike Chevalier&apos;s Griet, she is simply not a creature of her own times.\u00a0Secular, forthright, resolutely open\u2011minded even by contemporary standards, she is a modern heroine in period dress. This appears to have been\u00a0at least in part a deliberate decision by Burton \u2013 she has described her novel as a &quot;feminist golden-age fiction&quot; \u2013 but by vesting Oortman with sensibilities that match those of our own age, she breaks\u00a0the hermetic seal of her carefully imagined historical world and, like an oversized object in a\u00a0doll&apos;s house, threatens the integrity of\u00a0the whole enterprise. \u2022 To order The Miniaturist for \u00a310.39 with free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk.", "sentences": ["In 1686 18-year-old Nella Oortman, a country girl of good birth but straitened circumstances, is married to Johannes Brandt, a wealthy merchant trader twice her age, and dispatched to his luxurious house in Amsterdam.", "The Amsterdam of her novel is an overripe empire on the brink of rot, the excesses of its prosperity uneasily at odds with its strict Calvinist sensibilities.", "Like Chevalier&apos;s Delft, Burton&apos;s Amsterdam is a city where a woman&apos;s realm is strictly domestic; where, as Nella&apos;s mother observes, &quot;life&apos;s hard if you&apos;re not a wife&quot;.", "The miniaturist, by contrast, is\u00a0a free spirit, an ethereally blond foreigner who not only defies Amsterdam&apos;s strict guild system to work at her\u00a0craft but, more shockingly still, lives alone like a common prostitute."], "title": "The Miniaturist by Jessie Burton review \u2013 history with a modern-day heroine", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/10/miniaturist-jessie-burton-review-history-modern-day-heroine", "tags": ["Fiction", "History", "Books", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-10T10:44:48Z", "article": "Louis van Gaal will officially start work as Manchester United manager next week before flying out with his new squad on 18 July for the summer tour of America.

Meanwhile, United are yet to decide whether to play any lucrative friendlies next season to ease the \u00a335m-plus loss of having no European football for the first time since 1989. The club have been considering whether to do so since the spring when the prospect of finishing outside a Europa League place under the former manager, David Moyes, became apparent. However with Van Gaal having replaced Moyes the plans are now in the balance, with nothing finalised. United do not need permission from the Premier League or any other governing body to arrange the games, so the decision will be taken on a logistical basis. Van Gaal may decide that after Liverpool finished second last term having had no European football, he wants his new team to focus solely on challenging again with no distractions. As United are constantly offered multi-million-pound deals to play around the world in exhibition and testimonial games, the club hierarchy would be confident of filling the financial shortfall created by being out of European competition. Last season United turned down a sizeable offer to play a friendly during a warm-weather break in Dubai, and potential opposition could be against sides from the Middle East, China or America. United played a testimonial in Saudi Arabia, in January 2008, for the former Wolverhampton Wanderers reserve team player Sami Al-Jaber. The team jetted out to the Middle East directly after a Premier League game against Reading on a Saturday for the friendly two days later in what was a 6,000-mile round trip. While that exercise yielded the club around \u00a31m, during the six intervening years the increase in social media and new pay-per-view models means they could expect to earn considerable sums from other friendlies, beyond any appearance money offered by the hosts. United made last August\u2019s pre-season friendly with the Swedish side AIK available on pay-per-view for \u00a35.95. With the club\u2019s huge global fanbase, the earnings from matches sold in this way next year are potentially lucrative.", "sentences": ["Van Gaal is then expected to travel straight back to Amsterdam, attending an official World Cup reception on Monday, and so may arrive in Manchester as early as Tuesday."], "title": "Louis van Gaal to officially join Manchester United after Holland exit", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/10/louis-van-gaal-officially-join-manchester-united-holland-world-cup-argentina", "tags": ["Louis van Gaal", "Manchester United", "Holland", "World Cup 2014", "World Cup", "Friendlies", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-14T13:08:57Z", "article": "Louis van Gaal will arrive at Manchester United on Wednesday for his first official day as manager, with the Dutchman wanting the club to \u201csing from the same hymn sheet\u201d and become like the Holland squad he led to third-place at the World Cup.

Ten fire engines remained on the scene after rushing there to extinguish the many blazes caused by the crash.

The flight was carrying 280 passengers and 15 crew.&quot; The flight also had a Dutch airline flight number from KLM, KL4103. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine&apos;s interior minister, wrote on his Facebook page that the plane had crashed in Ukrainian territory after being hit by a missile fired from a Buk launcher. Associated Press said one of its journalists had seen a similar launcher near the town of Snizhne earlier on Thursday.     Credit: Guardian graphics    Leaders of the self-declared Donetsk people&apos;s republic denied any involvement, according to Interfax news agency. A member of the republic&apos;s security council said rebel weapons only had the capacity to shoot down a plane at 3,000 metres and blamed Ukrainian military forces for the attack. Poroshenko called for a commission to be set up to investigate the crash. &quot;This is the third tragic incident in recent days after Ukrainian military An-26 and Su-25 jets were shot down from Russian territory. We don&apos;t rule out that this plane was also shot down, and we stress that the Ukrainian military didn&apos;t take any actions to destroy targets in the air,&quot; he said. Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine accused Russia of downing one of its fighter jets inside Ukrainian territory. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, called allegations that Russia had been involved in the downing of MH17 &quot;stupidity&quot;. Peskov told the Guardian that the Kremlin would not make a further statement on the tragedy because &quot;no one knows&quot; who is responsible.     Local Ukrainian TV images show smoke from the Malaysia passenger airliner that has crashed near the Russian border.  Photograph: Universal News And Sport (Europe)    Asked about the possibility of further US sanctions in light of this bloody development in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, Peskov said he could not rule it out. &quot;The United States has recently been conducting a very non-constructive policy, and their actions are very unpredictable,&quot; he said. Speaking in Delaware, Barack Obama said that the incident &quot;looks like it may be a terrible tragedy&quot;, adding that his top priority was to find out whether American citizens were on board. &quot;I&apos;ve directed my national security team to stay in close contact with the Ukrainian government. The United States will offer any assistance we can to help determine what happened and why. As a country, our thoughts and prayers are with all the families of the passengers, wherever they call home.&quot; Earlier, Obama and Putin spoke on the phone about new US sanctions imposed on Moscow over its alleged failure to halt the flow of weapons and fighters to separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. Several airlines, including British Airways, Aeroflot, Turkish Airlines and Russia&apos;s Transaereo, announced that they would avoid Ukrainian airspace with immediate effect. Lufthansa said it would steer clear of airspace over eastern Ukraine. At least 30 Dutch-speaking passengers were on the plane, according to two travel agencies which sold tickets for the flight. According to Dutch newspaper websites, several Dutch passports were found near the scene of the crash. The Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, said via Twitter: &quot;I am shocked by reports that an MH plane crashed. We are launching an immediate investigation.&quot; The country&apos;s defence minister tweeted that he was &quot;monitoring closely&quot; claims that MH17 had crashed, saying: &quot;No comfirmation [sic] it was shot down! Our military have been instructed 2 get on it!&quot; The crash comes four months after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, two-thirds of them Chinese citizens. It has yet to be found despite a massive international search, which is ongoing, but Malaysia Airlines has said it believes everyone on board died when the plane crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. That aircraft was a Boeing-777 \u2013 the same kind of plane as flight MH17. In 2001, Ukraine admitted that its military was probably responsible for shooting down a Russian airliner that crashed into the Black Sea, killing all 78 on board. A senior Ukrainian official said it had most likely been downed by an accidental hit from an S-200 rocket fired during exercises. In 1983, a Soviet jet fighter shot down a South Korean airliner after it veered off course into Russian air space and failed to respond to attempts to make contact. All 269 passengers and crew were killed.

Tony Abbott used the strong language as he convened a meeting of the national security cabinet committee after flight MH17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine on Thursday, killing all 298 people on board. Australia would summon the Russian ambassador to seek a categorical assurance that the Russian government would fully co-operate with a thorough investigation, Abbott said, as \u201cit seems\u201d the plane was shot down by Russian-backed rebels. \u201cThis is no light thing; this is not something that can just be dismissed as a tragic accident when you have Russian proxies using Russian-supplied equipment to do terrible things \u2013 if in fact this is what turns out to have been the case. At the moment all we can say is the indications are this way,\u201d Abbott told Melbourne radio station 3AW. Nine of the victims are believed to be from Queensland, nine more from Victoria, seven from Western Australia, one from NSW and one from the ACT. On Friday afternoon the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said 28 Australians had died, not 27 as previously reported. Abbott said people around the world should be \u201cfilled with revulsion\u201d at the loss of innocent lives and he offered his deepest condolences for families and friends of those aboard the plane. \u201cAustralians stick together in tough times; but it is a grim day for the world,\u201d he said. The Australian government is pressing for \u201ca full, independent, international inquiry and investigation\u201d into the circumstances and has not ruled out cancelling an invitation for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to the G20 summit in Brisbane scheduled for November. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said there was \u201cvery strong speculation\u201d the Boeing 777 had been shot down and this would be an \u201cunspeakable crime\u201d, but she added: \u201cWe can&apos;t yet point the finger of blame until there&apos;s been a full investigation.\u201d The plane from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur came down close to the village of Grabovo in eastern Ukraine, which is part of the area controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Bishop said the government\u2019s thoughts and prayers were with family and friends. By 9am AEST about 170 people had called the consular emergency centre of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. \u201cI understand this was a flight connecting to Australia,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cIt was Amsterdam, Kuala Lumpur, Perth and that there are a number of Australians on that flight. I also understand that a number of people who were travelling to Melbourne for the 2014 Aids conference commencing this weekend were also on board,\u201d she said. Bishop said Australia was seeking to send consular staff from Warsaw to the rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, but would require access. Responding to reports Russian separatists had taken the black box flight recorder, Bishop said she urged them to cooperate with an investigation into the crash and \u201cif they have taken the black box that must be returned to authorities immediately\u201d. The incident underlined the urgent need to de-escalate the tensions and the situation in eastern Ukraine, Bishop said. Political leaders opened parliament on Friday with offers of sympathy to friends and family of the victims. Abbott told parliament the government owed it to the families of the dead to find out exactly what had happened and who was responsible, as it looked \u201cless like an accident than a crime\u201d and the perpetrators \u201cmust be brought to justice\u201d. \u201cI can inform the house that as quickly as possible Australia will be working at the United Nations security council for a binding resolution calling for a full and impartial investigation with full access to the site, with full access to the debris, with full access to the black box and with full access to all individuals who might be in a position to shed light on this terrible event,\u201d Abbott said. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, told parliament the \u201ctyrannical, wild act\u201d was a \u201cviolation of the rules of civilisation\u201d. \u201cThere are at least 27 Australians who have been murdered,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cThe missile that brought down MH17 and the missiles that have claimed numerous other Ukrainian aircraft could not possibly be made by the people who&apos;ve possibly fired them. These separatist terrorists are obtaining these instruments of murder from elsewhere.\u201d In an offer of bipartisan support, Shorten said the opposition understood the complexity of the decisions the prime minister would have to make and would cooperate. He said this might include actions involving the G20 and Labor would work with the government in taking a \u201cmeasured approach\u201d. The Greens deputy leader, Adam Bandt, added his voice to the parliamentary speeches, saying thousands of lives would be \u201ctouched by this tragedy and it\u2019s a reminder that any one of us in this parliament or this country could have been on that plane\u201d. Flight MH17 was flying over Ukrainian airspace, 1,000 feet above a no-fly zone when it is believed to have been shot down by a surface-to-air missile. Ukraine\u2019s government and Russian separatists have blamed each other for the crash. \u201cThis was not an &apos;incident&apos;, this was not a &apos;catastrophe&apos;, this was a terrorist act,&quot; said the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko. Putin laid the blame for the crash at Ukraine&apos;s door. \u201cThere is no doubt that the nation over whose airspace this happened bears responsibility for the terrible tragedy,\u201d he said. Abbott was asked whether Australia would rescind an invitation to Putin to attend the G20 summit it was hosting in November. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pre-empt what happens down the track,\u201d he said.

The huge loss of life threatens to have wide-ranging and unpredictable consequences, coming just after the US imposed further sanctions on Russia for continuing to provide weapons to the rebels. Defence and security experts said the Russian-made Buk surface-to-air missile system, known to be in the hands of pro-Russia fighters in Ukraine, was most likely used. &quot;This was not an &apos;incident&apos;, this was not a &apos;catastrophe&apos;, this was a terrorist act,&quot; said Ukraine&apos;s president, Petro Poroshenko. The US vice-president, Joe Biden, said the plane appeared to have been &quot;blown out of the sky&quot;, while the Ukrainian security services released an audio recording said to be rebel commanders realising their forces were responsible. A partial breakdown of passenger nationalities was released early on Friday, showing that 154 Dutch nationals, 43 Malaysians and 27 Australians were on board, along with nine passengers believed to be from the UK, four each from Germany and Belgium, three from the Philippines, one Canadian and 41 unverified. A group of international HIV/Aids experts flying to Melbourne were among those killed. Included in those numbers were the flight crew of 15, all Malaysian. The jet, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, came down near the village of Grabovo, part of the area controlled by pro-Russia separatists, on Thursday.           It had been flying 1,000ft above restricted airspace, according to the European air traffic control body. Eurocontrol said Ukrainian authorities had banned aircraft from flying at 32,000ft or below and the doomed aircraft had been cruising at 33,000ft \u2013\u00a0however this apparently still left it within range of the sophisticated surface-to-air weaponry that pro-Russia forces have been using recently in the Ukraine conflict. All civilian flights have now been barred from the area of eastern Ukraine. Malaysia&apos;s prime minister, Najib Razak, said: &quot;If it transpires that the flight was shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice.&quot; His country was sending a disaster response and assistance team to Ukraine. The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, said the world should be &quot;filled with revulsion&quot; at the plane&apos;s destruction and said &quot;Russian proxies, using Russian-supplied equipment&quot; may have been responsible. Australia&apos;s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said that if MH17 had been shot down it amounted to an &quot;unspeakable crime&quot; and a full international investigation must be allowed to take place. She said pro-Russia rebels, said to have retrieved the plane&apos;s black box flight recording equipment, must hand it over to authorities. In brief remarks the US president referred to the &quot;terrible tragedy&quot; and said efforts were under way to determine whether Americans had been killed. &quot;The world is watching,&quot; he said. &quot;The United States will offer whatever assistance we can to determine what happened and why.&quot; John Kerry, the secretary of state, made a statement of condolence and called for a &quot;credible international investigation&quot;. The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said: &quot;We do believe that there were British nationals on board the flight. We are working through passenger data, cross-checking it and referencing it to establish exactly the numbers and identities of those British nationals.&quot;     People walk among the debris of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Photograph: Dmitry Lovetsky/AP    The field next to the tiny hamlet was a scene of charred earth and twisted metal as shocked local people milled around the scene. Body parts belonging to the 298 people on board were strewn around. The body of what appeared to be a young woman was flung about 500m from the centre of the crash. US government officials confirmed to media outlets that a surface-to-air missile brought down the plane. US intelligence was reportedly still working to determine the exact location from which the missile was fired, and whether it was on the Russian or the Ukrainian side of the border. Rebels in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk people&apos;s republics have shot down several Ukrainian planes and helicopters in recent weeks. But they insisted they had no part in the downing of MH17, claiming instead that Ukrainian fire was responsible.     Credit: Guardian graphics    Ukraine&apos;s SBU security services released a recording, which could not immediately be verified, of what it said were rebel commanders saying they had shot down a plane and then discovering with horror it had been a civilian jet. On the ground in Grabovo, a strong smell of aviation fuel and burnt rubber hung in the air as dozens of pro-Russian separatist fighters milled around to control access to the area in which workers from the emergency services were sifting through the wreckage. A dozen fire engines were on the scene. One local resident, Alexander, was working in a field a few hundred metres from the crash site. He said he feared the aircraft was going to fall on top of him. Another farmer said he was on his tractor when he heard a loud bang. &quot;Then I saw the plane hit the ground and break in two \u2013 there was thick black smoke,&quot; he said. In a conflict that has not been short of unexpected twists, this was by far the most shocking and most gruesome to date. The 298 people aboard MH17 had no connection to the fighting except that their intercontinental flight was travelling through airspace above the battle zone. Questions were being raised as to why Malaysia Airlines had continued to fly over such a volatile region, where separatists were known to be shooting at aircraft. Qantas, the Australian carrier, said it had been steering clear of the area by 400 nautical miles for several months. Malaysia Airlines said after the crash that it had altered its flight paths and other airlines either did likewise or emphasised they had already been taking alternative routes. &quot;With immediate effect, all European flights operated by Malaysia Airlines will be taking alternative routes avoiding the usual route,&quot; said a statement from the airline. It added: &quot;The usual flight route was earlier declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. International Air Transportation Association has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions.&quot; Throughout the conflict, the versions of violent incidents provided by Kiev and the Donetsk rebels have diverged wildly, with each side blaming the other for loss of life and the shelling of residential areas. Now, with such a huge and unexpected loss of life, the stakes are immeasurably higher, and both sides again rushed to claim the other was at fault.

Photograph: Manan Vatsyayana/AFP/Getty Images    Those blaming pro-Russia rebels for the attack pointed to a post on a social media site attributed to a top rebel commander which claimed to have downed a Ukrainian transport plane around the same time as the first reports of MH17&apos;s disappearance surfaced. The post was later deleted. The US and EU have blamed Russia for providing the separatists in eastern Ukraine with logistical and military support, leading to a new set of White House sanctions against Russian companies, introduced on Wednesday, as rhetoric coming out of both Washington and Moscow has led to talk of a new cold war. Vladimir Putin&apos;s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Guardian that any allegations of Russian involvement in the tragedy were &quot;stupidity&quot;. He said the Kremlin would not make a further statement because &quot;no one knows&quot; who is responsible. Asked about the possibility of further US sanctions, Peskov said he could not rule it out: &quot;The United States has recently been conducting a very nonconstructive policy, and their actions are very unpredictable,&quot; he said. Putin himself, who on Thursday returned to Russia from a summit of the Brics nations in Brazil, informed Barack Obama about the incident. &quot;The Russian leader informed the US president of the report from air traffic controllers that the Malaysian plane had crashed on Ukrainian territory, which had arrived immediately before the phone call,&quot; said a statement released by the Kremlin. According to the statement, the pair spent most of the conversation discussing the deterioration of US-Russian relations, and Putin expressed his &quot;serious disappointment&quot; over the latest round of US sanctions against Russian companies. Later, Putin chaired a meeting on the Russian economy which began with a minute&apos;s silence, and laid the blame for the crash at Ukraine&apos;s door: &quot;There is no doubt that the nation over whose airspace this happened bears responsibility for the terrible tragedy,&quot; he said.     People stand next to the wrecked undercarriage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Photograph: Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty    Obama said the downing of the plane looked like &quot;a terrible tragedy&quot;. David Cameron, the British prime minister, tweeted: &quot;I&apos;m shocked and saddened by the Malaysian air disaster. Officials from across Whitehall are meeting to establish the facts.&quot; Putin later spoke by phone to the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, to express his &quot;most sincere condolences&quot; to the families of the dead. The crash came four months after a Malaysia Airlines flight, MH370, vanished on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, two-thirds of them Chinese citizens. It has yet to be found despite a huge search. The first rumours of improbable tragedy came as video appeared from villages nearby showing huge plumes of smoke rising into the air, and aviation sources told a local wire agency that a plane had been downed. The first official confirmation came when Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine&apos;s interior minister, wrote on his Facebook page that the plane had indeed crashed in Ukrainian territory, claiming it had been hit by a missile fired from a Buk launcher. Malaysia Airlines soon confirmed the worst fears, noting via its Twitter feed: &quot;Malaysia Airlines has lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam. The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace.&quot; Igor Sutyagin, a Russian military specialist at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, agreed that the plane would almost certainly have been hit from a Buk, a vehicle-mounted missile system first developed in the Soviet era. The Malaysian aircraft,was beyond the range of Manpads \u2013\u00a0shoulder-launched missiles. Kalashnikov-carrying Russian sympathisers in Ukraine would not have had the expertise to fire them and would have needed either specialists who had &quot;volunteered&quot; their services from Russia or locally recruited specialists, he said, but noted that the rebels had been firing at Ukrainian aircraft over the last week. The Associated Press said one of its journalists had seen a similar launcher near the town of Snizhne earlier on Thursday. Russia&apos;s state-owned Channel One avoided speculation of who might have been behind the plane crash in its first bulletins on the subject, while the Kremlin-friendly Life News, whose reporters were first on the scene, said it was likely to have been brought down by Ukrainian fire, claiming that the rebels did not have any missile systems with the capacity to down a plane travelling at that altitude. However, a report on the website of Russian state television from late June described how the rebels in Donetsk had taken control of a Ukrainian missile defence facility which was equipped with Buk systems. The report said that the rebels planned to &quot;defend the sky over Donetsk&quot; using the missile system. On Thursday afternoon a social media site attributed to Igor Strelkov, a Russian citizen who has emerged as the commander of rebel forces in Donetsk, announced that the rebels had shot down an An-26 Ukrainian transport plane, and also that there was &quot;information about a second plane&quot;. The post was later removed. &apos;It&apos;s a civilian&apos; On Thursday night audio was being circulated on social media, apparently released by Ukrainian security services, purporting to be an intercepted conversation of pro-Russian rebels confirming they had shot down a civilian jet. The conversation is apparently between a group leader and his superior and suggests that they initially thought they had brought down a military aircraft but later realised their error. The group leader, &quot;Demon&quot;, tells his boss: &quot;A plane has just been shot down. [It was] &apos;Miner&apos;s&apos; group. It crashed outside Enakievo. Our men went to search for and photograph it. It&apos;s smouldering.&quot; After his men apparently inspect the crash site, Demon reports back. &quot;Cossacks from the Chernunkhino checkpoint shot down the plane. The plane disintegrated in mid-air \u2026 they found the first body. It&apos;s a civilian.&quot; He carries on: &quot;I mean. It&apos;s definitely a civilian aircraft.&quot; His superior, nicknamed &quot;Greek&quot;, asks him: &quot;Were there many people?&quot; Demon replies: &quot;A fuckton. The debris rained right into the yards.&quot; Greek asks: &quot;What&apos;s the aircraft?&quot; and is told: &quot;I haven&apos;t figured it out yet. I haven&apos;t reached the main section. I only looked at where the bodies began to fall. There are remains of chair mounts, the chairs, the bodies.&quot; Greek asks: &quot;Any weapons there?&quot; and Demon says: &quot;None at all. Civilian things, medical stuff, towels, toilet paper.&quot; &quot;Any documents?&quot; asks Greek, and Demon, perhaps realising what has just happened, replies: &quot;Yes, an Indonesian student from [a US] university.&quot; Additional reporting by Tania Branigan in Beijing, Ewen MacAskill in London and Paul Lewis in Washington \u2022 This article was amended on 18 July 2014.

Pim was Dutch and a parliamentary lobbyist for Stop Aids Now! I knew him from Amsterdam, through my job as an editor of a European multilingual magazine in Paris. I checked all of my emails with him a moment ago. The best of them remain lost, in my old work email. But I still have one of his old CVs. I had just started my job when Pim was recruited to join me on a trip to Barcelona in 2007, a mission to write about the city. He was writing about unlicensed street performers, and he got an amazing, surreal picture of a clown being told off by a policeman on the Ramblas. Perfect. He was one of my very best, most enthusiastic writers and stayed in constant contact with me. As an election observer he got to travel a little, and was a real global citizen. He was not paid for the articles he wrote for us in Paris, but he sent dispatches with the very best of intentions: to show another side of a same old story, and to appease his passion for exploring the unknown. The countries he covered included Ukraine and Russia, where he was an election observer for the Dutch foreign ministry. We had a kind, mutually supportive relationship, though I was not in touch with him in recent years. He had returned to the Netherlands after a long period of soul-searching, adventure and travels when we last spoke. He had written a little memoir which he wanted to publish and asked me to read through. He was the first of my colleagues to start a first book and I was so proud. It was only 66 pages, divided into little chapters for different countries he had been to: Kosovo, Sierra Leone, and also Malaysia, where he was to return following the Aids conference. Pim&apos;s last post and photo is from Schiphol airport. His friends and acquaintances will continue to mourn him online, as we are so used to in our generation. I don&apos;t think Pim and I were even on Facebook when we met. My friendship with him symbolises an era when so many of us young Europeans were looking for each other, to work together, to share our languages and stories, in the mid-00s. At 32, he was one year older than me. I&apos;ve spoken briefly to Pim&apos;s brother, Paul, on Facebook. He is happy for our support, and for everyone to know how wonderful Pim was, though there are plenty of others who can attest to that far better than I. Pim interned for the former MEPs Lousewies van der Laan and Emine Bozkurt. As well as his work for Stop Aids Now!, he was active for the liberal political party D66. He held training workshops for politicians in Sarajevo and went on several election missions, most recently in Egypt.  Van der Laan said in a statement: &apos;&apos;Last Wednesday Pim and I met up in The Hague for a coffee as we always do when in the same town. We caught a train to Amsterdam together and spent a lovely few hours catching up. We had developed a tradition of him meeting me at foreign airports (Beijing, Sarajevo) and then trying to install some democracy into the place, while catching up, having good food and celebrating life and shared values. \u201cNo one should have died on that flight and I still can&apos;t get my head around the fact that he was killed. I was already furious with Putin for allowing nationalist hotheads to make east Ukraine into a danger zone, but now that passenger airplanes are being shot out of the sky, this madness must be stopped. \u201cPim believed in understanding between countries, the rule of law and equality for all and fought for his values through his work and his political activities. Let&apos;s try to live up to his legacy and work even harder towards a peaceful world.&apos;&apos; My former colleague Thamar Zijlstra, also from Amsterdam, remembered Pim coming out in public at a comedy show.

Clinton said in an interview with Charlie Rose on the American PBS network: &quot;The questions I&apos;d be asking is, number one, who could have shot it down? Who had the equipment? It&apos;s obviously an anti-aircraft missile. Who could have had the expertise to do that? Because commercial airlines are big targets, but by the time they got over that part of Ukraine they should have been high, so it takes some planning [to target such a plane]. &quot;And the Ukrainian government has been quick to blame it on terrorists, which is their name for the Russian insurgents. And there does seem to be some growing awareness that it probably had to be Russian insurgents.           Hillary Clinton said Russian-backed rebels were most likely responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine. Video: Courtesy of Charlie Rose/Reuters    &quot;Now, how we determine that will require some forensics, but then if there is evidence pointing in that direction, the equipment had to have come from Russia. What more the Russians may or may not have done, we don&apos;t know. &quot;Europeans have to be the ones to take the lead on this. It was a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur over European territory. There should be outrage in European capitals.&quot; Joe Biden, the vice-president, said the plane had &quot;apparently had been shot down. Shot down, not an accident. Blown out of the sky.&quot; &quot;We see reports that there may have been American citizens on board and obviously that&apos;s our first concern. And we are now working every minute to confirm those reports as I speak,&quot; Biden said at the start of a conference address in Detroit. &quot;This is truly a grave situation. Nearly 300 souls have been lost. The families have our consolation and our prayers. And there are many of them who need answers, and we will get those answers and we will take the next steps accordingly.

News of the deaths of almost 300 passengers and crew came less than five months after the disappearance of another Malaysia Airlines flight, MH370, with 239 on board. That aircraft is still missing, believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean with the loss of all lives.

Russia said earlier that its president had called to the Malaysian leader &quot;to convey his deepest sympathy and support&quot; to the victims\u2019 families. Najib warned: \u201cWe must \u2013 and we will \u2013 find out precisely what happened to this flight. No stone can be left unturned. \u201cIf it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must be swiftly brought to justice.\u201d That message was echoed by Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, who went further than Najib by telling parliament it appeared Russian-backed rebels were responsible for the disaster.  &quot;As things stand this looks less like an accident than a crime,&quot; he said. Najib said the plane had gone down with no distress call and noted that the flight route had been declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and that the International Air Transportation Association had said the airspace the jet was crossing was not subject to restrictions. Najib said he could not imagine what the family and friends of those onboard must be going through, and that Malaysia\u2019s thoughts and prayers were with them. He said the president of Ukraine had promised a \u201cfull, thorough and independent investigation\u201d, with Malaysian officials invited to take part.

The Australian prime minister said Russia\u2019s denial of any responsibility \u201cfrankly does not stand up to any serious scrutiny\u201d, emphasising that the Boeing 777 was shot down in eastern Ukraine \u201cover territory controlled by Russian-backed rebels\u201d and \u201cby a missile which seems to have been launched by Russian-backed rebels\u201d.  Ahead of a United Nations security council meeting on Friday to discuss the incident, Abbott warned Russia against using its veto to obstruct an extensive investigation into the circumstances that led to flight MH17 coming down near the village of Grabovo on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t allow Russia to prevent an absolutely comprehensive investigation so we can find out exactly what happened here,\u201d Abbott said on Friday after confirming the number of known Australian deaths had risen from 27 to 28. \u201cThis is not an accident, it is a crime. I stress it is not an accident, it is a crime, and criminals should not be allowed to get away with what they&apos;ve done.\u201d Having earlier blamed Russia for providing the surface-to-air missile launcher to the rebels accused of the attack, Abbott said he took a \u201cvery dim view of countries which are facilitating the killing of Australian citizens\u201d. \u201cAnyone who gave such a weapon to people who are absolutely incapable of using it, any country which was inspiring and orchestrating the kind of activity we&apos;re now seeing in eastern Ukraine I think has a heavy responsibility, should feel a sense of shame over what has taken place,\u201d he said. The prime minister hardened his language following a meeting between his foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, and the Russian ambassador in Sydney on Friday afternoon.

The UN Security Council must support an investigation \u201cto get to the bottom of who was responsible for this unspeakable crime\u201d so that the perpetrators could be brought to account, Bishop said. Emerging from the meeting, Bishop said the Russian ambassador had denied that pro-Russian separatists were culpable for the attack.

Putin had earlier laid the blame for the crash at Ukraine&apos;s door. \u201cThere is no doubt that the nation over whose airspace this happened bears responsibility for the terrible tragedy,\u201d Putin said. Abbott said this response was unacceptable: \u201cI just want to say that it is absolutely imperative if Russia is to maintain any international standing at all that there be complete Russian cooperation with this. No provocation, no excuses, no blame-shifting, no protecting of people who may be backed by Russia but who may have been involved in this terrible event.\u201d Australian political leaders opened parliament on Friday with offers of sympathy to friends and family of the victims.

Lange was president of the International Aids Society, which runs the meeting, from 2002 to 2004, spanning the two-year interval between the Barcelona and Bangkok conferences, where drug treatment for all those with HIV around the world were top of the agenda. The Aids pandemic threw scientists such as Lange into the political maelstrom and many of them took on campaigning and political roles alongside their research. Lange, 60, was professor of medicine at the academic medical centre of the University of Amsterdam and specialised in drugs to treat HIV infection and prevent people developing Aids. He was senior scientific adviser to the International Antiviral Therapy Evaluation Centre in Amsterdam. Having helped to develop drugs for HIV, he was in the forefront of efforts by the scientific community to make them widely available to a population in the developing world who could not possibly pay the very high prices drug companies asked. Around the time of the 2000 Durban Aids conference, when the controversy around access was at its height, a three-drug combination cost $10,000 per patient per year. In 2001, Lange founded the PharmAccess Foundation, which worked to get access to the drugs for those in poor countries and he continued as its chair until his death. He was also co-director of an HIV research collaboration based in Thailand. The director of the Wellcome Trust, Dr Jeremy Farrar, paid tribute to him and others in the HIV community who died on the plane. He said: &quot;I am deeply saddened that Joep Lange, his partner Jacqueline van Tongeren, and other colleagues from the World Health Organisation and the HIV research community are reported to be among those killed in the MH17 disaster. &quot;Joep was a great clinical scientist, and a great friend of the Wellcome Trust who has long been a valued adviser. He was also a personal friend. He is a great loss to global health research. The thoughts and sympathies of all of us at the Trust are with his family and other families who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.&quot; Emeritus professor of viral oncology at UCL, Prof Robin Weiss, said: &quot;Not since the loss of Jonathan Mann and his wife on the sabotaged Swiss Air flight to Geneva 17 years ago has the HIV/Aids research community suffered such a great loss.&quot; Shaun Mellors, the associate director for Africa at the UK-based International HIV/Aids Alliance, talked of the shock and sadness of everybody in the HIV community. &quot;This is a profound collective loss to science, to research, to medicine and to public health and our deepest condolences are with their loved ones,&quot; he said. &quot;They spent their lives fighting for the lives of others and we pledge to continue their important work. &quot;I first met Joep in 1995 when I was working for the Global Network of People Living with HIV (GNP+). I was young and an inexperienced activist who had moved from South Africa to take on this challenging new role as the executive director and in Joep I found a mentor and ally. He was a powerful advocate for treatment access, fought hard to ensure that people living with HIV were involved and included, was not afraid to share his views even if they were against the establishment, and he had a wicked and enjoyable sense of humour. &quot;He taught me a lot about equity and politics, and also about being a humble and effective individual. He introduced me to the world of clinical science, where I did not have to be afraid of it, but rather question and engage with it. His commitment to the work that he was doing is something that we all need to continue \u2013 because he would expect it of us, nothing less.&quot; There was shock, outrage and distress at the Melbourne conference, which officially opens on Sunday but is already running sessions. &quot;There&apos;s a huge feeling of sadness here, people are in floods of tears in the corridors,&quot; Clive Aspin, a HIV researcher who attended the pre-conference plenary session in Sydney, told Guardian Australia. &quot;These people were the best and the brightest, the ones who had dedicated their whole careers to fighting this terrible virus.

An earlier Kremlin statement said the Russian president believed the &quot;state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this awful tragedy&quot; while the Ukraine&apos;s foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, said there was no chance the missile was of Ukrainian military origin. He said the Ukrainian army did not have such missiles in the area, and said none had been seized by separatist fighters in recent weeks.

The White House stopped short of directly blaming Russia for the plane&apos;s destruction but linked its remarks on the disaster to the Kremlin&apos;s support for separatists in Ukraine. Washington has urged Putin&apos;s government to stop inflaming the situation in the country and take &quot;concrete steps&quot; towards de-escalating the conflict. The huge loss of life threatens to have wide-ranging and unpredictable consequences, coming just after the US imposed further sanctions on Russia for continuing to provide weapons to the rebels. The former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton made some of the most potent remarks in a television interview, saying there were strong indications Russian-backed militia were to blame and called on the EU to intensify sanctions. Australia&apos;s prime minister, Tony Abbott, speaking as 27 Australians were confirmed dead, called on Russia to explain the disaster as it &quot;now seems certain it&apos;s been brought down by a Russian-supplied surface-to-air missile&quot;.     Hillary Clinton says Russian-backed rebels were most likely responsible for shooting down flight MH17.

The German chancellor said: &quot;The events with the plane, as far as I remember, were not even 24 hours ago and at the moment we need to sort out an independent investigation.&quot; David Cameron said it was also too early to know for certain who was to blame but said if flight MH17 &quot;was brought down, then those responsible must be held to account&quot;. There were 189 Dutch nationals on board the plane, along with 44 Malaysians, 27 Australians, 12 Indonesians, nine passengers believed to be from the UK, four each from Germany and Belgium, three from the Philippines, one Canadian and one from New Zealand. The nationalities of four passengers have not yet been verified.     Hundreds of people bring flowers and candles to the Dutch embassy in Kiev after the crash.

Flags were at half-mast in the Netherlands and Australia. The Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, said the terrible and deeply shocking news marked &quot;a tragic day in what has already been a tragic year for Malaysia&quot;. The passenger jet was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday when it was blown apart and fell in a shower of fiery wreckage over Grabovo, part of the area controlled by pro-Russia separatists. The European air traffic control body, Eurocontrol, said Ukrainian authorities had banned aircraft from flying at 32,000ft (9,754 metres) or below and that flight MH17 had been cruising above that, at 33,000ft \u2013 but this apparently still left the plane within range of the sophisticated surface-to-air weaponry that pro-Russia forces have been using recently to target Ukrainian military aircraft. All civilian flights have now been barred from eastern Ukraine.     A mother sees her daughter's name on the list of passengers on board Malaysia Airlines MH17.

Qantas, the Australian carrier, said it had been steering clear of the area by 400 nautical miles for several months. &quot;It is many years that we have taken the same route and many other countries take the same route,&quot; Liow said. He stressed that 15 of 16 Asia-Pacific airlines fly &quot;this route over Ukraine&quot;, adding: &quot;European airlines also use the same route, and traverse the same airspace. In the hours before the incident, a number of other passenger aircraft from different carriers used the same route.&quot; Liow also said that there had been &quot;no last-minute instructions&quot; given to the pilots to change the route.

On Friday, she learned her stepdaughter, Maree Rizk, and Rizk&apos;s husband, Albert \u2013 both estate agents \u2013 had been on board the flight downed over Ukraine. &quot;It&apos;s just ripped our guts again,&quot; Mann&apos;s brother, Greg Burrows, told reporters. They were among 298 victims of the apparent missile attack, almost two thirds of whom were Dutch nationals, with Malaysians and Australians the next most numerous. Among the dead were a series of leading researchers into HIV/Aids, holidaying families, a member of the Dutch senate, football supporters, teachers, a nun and a relative of Malayia&apos;s prime minister, Najib Razak. The search for remains in Ukraine, involving emergency workers, police officers and off-duty coal miners, has recovered 181 bodies so far.

Among the Dutch nationals on the flight was Joep Lange, a pioneering Aids researcher, who is reported to have died along with his wife, Jacqueline van Tongeren. The couple reportedly had five daughters. Some accounts say dozens of those on MH17 were on their way to Melbourne in Australia for the 20th International Aids conference, which starts on Sunday. The flight to Kuala Lumpur had been due to fly on to Australia. Denis Napthine, the premier of Victoria state, of which Melbourne is the capital, said: &quot;There&apos;s been confirmed a number of senior people who were coming out here who were researchers, who were medical scientists, doctors, people who&apos;ve been at the forefront of dealing with Aids across the world.&quot; Lange, a professor at the academic medical centre at the University of Amsterdam, had researched HIV/Aids for more than 30 years and was known as an advocate for access to affordable drugs in poorer countries, colleagues said. &quot;He&apos;s one of the icons of the whole area of research.

Glenn Thomas, 49, was a media officer at the World Health Organisation in Geneva, and a former BBC journalist. Also confirmed among the British victims were John Alder and Liam Sweeney, fans of Newcastle United heading to New Zealand to watch the Premier League football team play a pre-season tour, and student Richard Mayne. According to Malaysia&apos;s Star newspaper, the country&apos;s prime minister lost a family member. Among those on board was the 83-year-old second wife of his late grandfather. Among the Dutch passengers was Willem Witteveen, a Labour member of the country&apos;s senate. Many others on the flight were holidaymakers, including several children. Nick Norris, 68, from the Australian city of Perth, was travelling with his three grandchildren, Mo Maslin, 12, Evie Maslin, 10, and Otis Maslin, 8, according to a statement from his family.

Another Dutch national, Cor Pan, had been heading for a beach holiday in Malaysia. He posted a photo of the plane on Facebook just before it took off, with the message, &quot;If it should disappear, this is what it looks like,&quot; a joking reference to MH370. Pan was travelling with his girlfriend, named so far only as Neeltje, who owned a flower shop in the fishing town of Volendam. A note taped to the front of the shop on Friday read: &quot;Dear Cor and Neeltje. This is unwanted, unbelievable and unfair. Rest in peace.

Defence and security experts said the Russian-made Buk surface-to-air missile system, known to be in the hands of pro-Russia fighters in Ukraine, was most likely used.

The European air traffic control body, Eurocontrol, said Ukrainian authorities had banned aircraft from flying at 32,000ft or below and the doomed aircraft had been cruising above that, at 33,000ft \u2013 however this apparently still left it within range of the sophisticated surface-to-air weaponry that pro-Russia forces have been using recently to target Ukrainian military aircraft. All civilian flights have now been barred from eastern Ukraine. The field next to the tiny hamlet was a scene of charred earth and twisted metal as shocked local people milled around the scene. Body parts belonging to the 298 on board were strewn around. The body of what appeared to be a young woman had been flung about 500m from the centre of the crash. US government officials confirmed to media outlets that a surface-to-air missile brought down the plane. US intelligence was reportedly still working to determine the exact location from which the missile was fired, and whether it was on the Russian or the Ukrainian side of the border. Rebels in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk people&apos;s republics have shot down several Ukrainian planes and helicopters in recent weeks. But they insisted they had no part in the downing of MH17, claiming instead that Ukrainian fire was responsible. Ukraine&apos;s SBU security services released a recording, which could not immediately be verified, of what it said were rebel commanders saying they had shot down a plane and then discovering with horror it had been a civilian jet.           Ukraine security services recording said to reveal pro-Russia separatists admitting they shot down plane.    On the ground in Grabovo a strong smell of aviation fuel and burnt rubber hung in the air as dozens of pro-Russian separatist fighters milled around the area in which workers from the emergency services were sifting through the wreckage. A dozen fire engines were on the scene. One local resident, Alexander, had been working in a field a few hundred metres from the crash site and thought the aircraft was going to fall on top of him. Another farmer said he was on his tractor when he heard a loud bang. &quot;Then I saw the plane hit the ground and break in two \u2013 there was thick black smoke,&quot; he said. In a conflict that has not been short of dreadful twists, this was by far the most shocking and most gruesome to date. The 298 people on board MH17 had no connection to the fighting \u2013 their international flight was simply travelling through airspace above the battle zone.           Malaysia Airlines announces the nationalities of those on board flight MH17.    Throughout the Ukraine conflict the versions of violent incidents provided by Kiev and the Donetsk rebels have diverged wildly, with each side blaming the other for loss of life and the shelling of residential areas. Now, with such a huge and unexpected loss of life, the stakes are immeasurably higher, and both sides again rushed to claim the other was at fault. Those blaming pro-Russia rebels for the attack pointed to a post on a social media site attributed to a top rebel commander which claimed to have downed a Ukrainian transport plane around the same time as the first reports of MH17&apos;s disappearance surfaced. The post was later deleted. The US and EU have heavily criticised Russia for providing the separatists in eastern Ukraine with logistical and military support, leading to a new set of White House sanctions against Russian companies, introduced on Wednesday, as rhetoric coming out of both Washington and Moscow has led to talk of a new cold war. Vladimir Putin&apos;s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Guardian that any allegations of Russian involvement in the MH17 crash were &quot;stupidity&quot;. He said the Kremlin would not make a further statement because &quot;no one knows&quot; who is responsible.  Asked about the possibility of further US sanctions, Peskov said he could not rule it out: &quot;The United States has recently been conducting a very nonconstructive policy and their actions are very unpredictable,&quot; he said. Putin, who on Thursday returned to Russia from a summit of the Brics nations in Brazil, informed Barack Obama about the incident. &quot;The Russian leader informed the US president of the report from air traffic controllers that the Malaysian plane had crashed on Ukrainian territory, which had arrived immediately before the phone call,&quot; said a statement released by the Kremlin. According to the statement, the pair spent most of the conversation discussing the deterioration of US-Russian relations, and Putin expressed his &quot;serious disappointment&quot; over the latest round of US sanctions against Russian companies. Later Putin chaired a meeting on the Russian economy which began with a minute&apos;s silence and laid the blame for the crash at Ukraine&apos;s door: &quot;There is no doubt that the nation over whose airspace this happened bears responsibility for the terrible tragedy,&quot; he said. David Cameron, the British prime minister, tweeted: &quot;I&apos;m shocked and saddened by the Malaysian air disaster. Officials from across Whitehall are meeting to establish the facts.&quot; The crash came four months after another Malaysia Airlines flight, MH370, vanished on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, two-thirds of them Chinese citizens. It has yet to be found despite a huge search.           Ukrainian president says shooting down of plane is a warning for the world on Russian aggression.    Igor Sutyagin, a Russian military specialist at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, agreed that the plane would almost certainly have been shot with a Buk, a vehicle-mounted missile system first developed in the Soviet era. The Malaysian aircraft,was beyond the range of Manpads \u2013 shoulder-launched missiles. Kalashnikov-carrying Russian sympathisers in Ukraine would not have had the expertise to fire them and would have needed either specialists who had &quot;volunteered&quot; their services from Russia or locally recruited specialists, he said, noting that the rebels had been firing at Ukrainian aircraft over the last week. The Associated Press said one of its journalists had seen a similar launcher near the town of Snizhne earlier on Thursday. Russia&apos;s state-owned Channel One avoided speculation of who might have been behind the plane crash in its first bulletins on the subject, while the Kremlin-friendly Life News, whose reporters were first on the scene, said it was likely to have been brought down by Ukrainian fire, claiming that the rebels did not have any missile systems with the capacity to down a plane at that altitude. However a report on the website of Russian state television from late June described how the rebels in Donetsk had taken control of a Ukrainian missile defence facility that was equipped with Buk systems. The report said that the rebels planned to &quot;defend the sky over Donetsk&quot; using the missiles. On Thursday afternoon a social media site attributed to Igor Strelkov, a Russian citizen who has emerged as the commander of rebel forces in Donetsk, announced that the rebels had shot down an An-26 Ukrainian transport plane, and also that there was &quot;information about a second plane&quot;. The post was later removed. Audio was circulated on social media, apparently released by Ukrainian security services, purporting to be an intercepted conversation of pro-Russia rebels confirming they had shot down a civilian jet. The conversation is apparently between a group leader and his superior and suggests that they initially thought they had brought down a military aircraft but later realised their error. The group leader, &quot;Demon&quot;, tells his boss: &quot;A plane has just been shot down. [It was] &apos;Miner&apos;s&apos; group. It crashed outside Enakievo. Our men went to search for and photograph it. It&apos;s smouldering.&quot; After his men apparently inspect the crash site, Demon reports back. &quot;Cossacks from the Chernunkhino checkpoint shot down the plane. The plane disintegrated in mid-air \u2026 they found the first body. It&apos;s a civilian.&quot; He carries on: &quot;I mean. It&apos;s definitely a civilian aircraft.&quot; His superior, nicknamed &quot;Greek&quot;, asks him: &quot;Were there many people?&quot; Demon replies: &quot;A fuckton. The debris rained right into the yards.&quot; Greek asks: &quot;What&apos;s the aircraft?&quot; and is told: &quot;I haven&apos;t figured it out yet. I haven&apos;t reached the main section. I only looked at where the bodies began to fall. There are remains of chair mounts, the chairs, the bodies.&quot; Greek asks: &quot;Any weapons there?&quot; and Demon says: &quot;None at all. Civilian things, medical stuff, towels, toilet paper.&quot; &quot;Any documents?&quot; asks Greek, and Demon, perhaps realising what has just happened, replies: &quot;Yes, an Indonesian student from Thomson university [in the US].&quot; Additional reporting by Tania Branigan in Beijing, Ewen MacAskill in London, Paul Lewis in Washington and Warren Murray of Guardian Australia", "sentences": ["The jet was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday when it was blown apart and fell in a shower of fiery wreckage over the village of Grabovo, part of the area controlled by pro-Russia separatists."], "title": "Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crash: world demands answers from Russia", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/mh17-pressure-on-russia-as-world-demands-answers-over-planes-destruction", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Ukraine", "Russia", "Plane crashes", "Europe", "Malaysia", "World news", "US politics", "US news", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-18T15:05:06Z", "article": "Tragedy strikes again for Malaysia Airlines The details are still emerging, but news that a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down over Ukraine on Thursday, killing at least 298, has caused shock and outrage around the world.

Australia confirms climate pariah status by axing carbon tax     Factory emissions are seen across Botany Bay in Sydney. Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images    Australia has demonstrated its commitment to climate change \u2013 by axing the only legislative measure it had in place to reduce carbon emissions. The senate voted this week to repeal the carbon tax, which was introduced only two years ago. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, described the tax as useless and destructive and said his government had listened to the Australian people by repealing the measure. His party had argued that the policy unfairly penalised businesses.  The change will leave an estimated A$7bn (\u00a33.8bn) hole in the government budget, with 350 energy providers and manufacturing companies no longer required to pay the tax. Australia has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 5% from its 2000 levels by 2020. Labor and the Greens have vowed to reintroduce the measure if elected in 2016.

Photograph: UK Space Agency/PA    Eight sites in Britain are battling it out to become the country&apos;s first commercial spaceport. The shortlist was unveiled on Tuesday at the Farnborough air show. Six of the sites are located in Scotland and include Campbeltown and Glasgow Prestwick airports. Newquay Cornwall airport and Llanbedr airport in Snowdonia are the only two potential sites outside Scotland. After a shift in the government&apos;s attitude in favour of supporting and capitalising on space tourism, it is hoped the new spaceport will be up and running by 2018. There will be a three-month consultation before the winning site is decided.  Richard Branson has vowed to be on board the first Virgin Galactic commercial flight. For a mere \u00a3120k, tourists can enjoy a 150-minute trip, including six minutes of zero-gravity.

Photograph: Mike Hutchings/Reuters    New plans to build an opencast mine on the edge of one of the world&apos;s top rhino reserves are posing a further threat to the creature. The mine, to be located at the edge of Hluhluwe-Imfolozi reserve in South Africa, would pollute the air and rivers, turn the land into waste dumps and provide easier access to the already numerous poachers in the area, according to opponents.  Figures released last week showed that 2014 has already had a high number of rhino deaths at the hands of poachers, with 558 deaths recorded \u2013 100 more than this time last year, which saw a record-breaking 1,051 killed over the whole of 2013. Since 2005, there has been a surge in poaching in Africa, fuelled largely by demand from some south Asian countries where people believe properties of the horns are able to cure diseases such as cancer. South Africa, which is home to about 80% of the world&apos;s rhino population, signed an agreement with neighbouring Mozambique in April to tackle the issue.

After six months&apos; work, Operation Notarise has led to the arrest of 660 suspects, 90% of whom were previously unknown to the police, and 39 who were already on the sex offenders register. Among them was a junior paediatrician who allegedly had more than 1 million obscene images of children on their computer.

Photograph: Guy Corbishley/Demotix/Corbis    The cabinet reshuffle certainly raised some eyebrows this week. It began with the news that the foreign secretary William Hague was departing, before the No 10 spin machine went into overdrive to make much of the new female entrants in cabinet. Conservative strategists who have perceived a problem in attracting female voters wanted to make sure those potential supporters knew about the new additions.  Nicky Morgan took the biggest job on offer to the women, taking the education secretary role off Michael Gove. Liz Truss moved into environment and Tina Stowell became leader of the House of Llords. Esther McVey stays as a minister for employment, but has now been given permission to attend cabinet. Labour has mocked the move as a last-minute PR stunt, pointing out that David Cameron has had four years to include women in his cabinet and failed to do so.

The boys, all cousins aged between nine and 12, were killed as they tried to flee shelling from an Israeli gunboat. Their uncle described the event as a &quot;cold-blooded massacre&quot;. Witnesses, including the Guardian journalist Peter Beaumont, witnessed the event, noting that even from some distance, it was clear the boys were only children.  The five-hour truce was called to allow food and supplies to reach the many Palestinians who have been trapped in their houses for days. But it didn&apos;t last long.

Church of England approves female bishops     Female clergy and supporters celebrate after the Church of England General Synod voted to allow women to become bishops. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian    The Church of England finally resolved the gender debate on Monday when the General Synod voted overwhelmingly in favour of allowing women to become bishops. There was applause from the public gallery as the decision was announced. Women will be able to be ordained from summer 2015 once the necessary legal changes have been made.  Twenty years after the first female priests were permitted, the vote ends 2,000 years of male-dominated tradition in the Church of England.  The synod had been threatened with parliamentary action if the measure failed, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, had prepared contingency plans for fresh elections if the vote had gone the other way. In the end, several lay members had a change of heart from previous years and voted to approve the motion.

Megumi Igarash, who works under the pseudonym Rokudenashiko, has created works \u2013 such as a Lady Gaga model and a full-sized kayak modelled on her vagina \u2013 to address what she sees as a double standard applied to female and male genitalia in Japan.  Media reports say police raided Igarashi&apos;s office and seized 20 of her artworks. &quot;Japan is still a society where those who try to express women&apos;s sexuality are suppressed, while men&apos;s sexuality is overly tolerated,&quot; the artist said. She has made it her mission to demystify the female form, and prevent it from being &quot;overly hidden&quot; in society.

Malaysia Airlines originally said there were nine British people on board the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur but revised the number up to 10 on Friday afternoon. Among those whose identities were confirmed was Glenn Thomas, a media officer with the World Health Organisation for more than a decade. He was one of up to 100 people believed to be on their way to an Aids conference in Melbourne, Australia. The 49-year-old former BBC journalist from Blackpool specialised in infectious diseases, namely HIV, TB and malaria.

He will be greatly missed by those who had the opportunity to know him and work with him.&quot; He leaves behind his partner, Claudio, and twin sister, Tracey. John Alder and Liam Sweeney were on their way to watch Newcastle United play in a pre-season tour of New Zealand. Alder, in his 60s, was known affectionately as &quot;the undertaker&quot; because he wore a black suit and white shirt to every match and was said to have not missed a match since 1973. Sweeney, 28, volunteered as a steward on supporters&apos; buses to away games. The stalwart supporters even attended reserve team and academy matches. The Newcastle United manager, Alan Pardew, said their passion for the club was obvious from the fact that they were flying out to New Zealand. &quot;Myself and all the players are deeply shocked and saddened by this terrible news,&quot; he said. &quot;We all knew how passionately John and Liam supported the team and the club.&quot;     John Alder, who died on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.

I really cannot believe it \u2013 it&apos;s totally devastating. He did not deserve this.&quot;     British student Richard Mayne.    Richard Mayne, 20, a maths and finance undergraduate at Leeds University, had picked the flight specifically because he was diabetic and needed a stopover, his father said. &quot;He was on his way to Perth [in Australia],&quot; Simon Mayne said from the family home in Leicester. &quot;When we were looking at flights together, there was this one that stopped in Amsterdam and we thought it would be perfect. He was diabetic so we thought it would be a good chance for him to do whatever he needed to do and maybe even go out and have a ride on the bikes and see Amsterdam. He was really looking forward to it.&quot; He said he had taken his son to the airport at 3am. &quot;When I first saw it on the news, my heart dropped. I just thought, oh God, oh God \u2013 I couldn&apos;t believe it,&quot; he said. &quot;We were hoping and praying he had fallen asleep at Amsterdam and missed his flight. We are beyond devastated.&quot; Mayne was an avid rugby player and had recently raised more than \u00a31,000 for underprivileged children in Nepal after climbing to Everest base camp. After completing the trek, he volunteered at a local school helping underprivileged children with learning difficulties. Tributes from Leeds University&apos;s rugby club, which described him as &quot;an honest and kind man&quot;, and Leeds Rag, the student fundraising society, were among dozens posted on social media. Another student, Ben Pocock, from Bristol, was flying out to begin a professional placement and to study for six months at the University of Western Australia as part of the third year of his degree. His family said in a statement: &quot;He was a gifted academic, talented athlete but more importantly a warm, caring, fun-loving son and brother who had an extremely bright future ahead of him. Ben is going to be terribly missed not only by his family but by the wider Keynsham community where he made so many long-lasting friends.&quot; A spokeswoman for Loughborough University, where he had just completed his second year, offered condolences to his family and friends. &quot;Ben was an excellent student and on course to gain a first-class degree,&quot; she said. He played on the university athletic union&apos;s ultimate frisbee team and won their player of the year honour. On Wednesday, in his final tweet, Pocock, who is believed to be 20, wrote: &quot;Should be in bed #Recovering but I haven&apos;t packed yet and I leave in 18 hours.&quot; Tributes were paid to Pocock on the Facebook page of the cricket club he played for, St Mary Redcliffe. Stefan Putwain wrote that Pocock had developed into &quot;a young man with the world at his feet. So sad.&quot; While Matthew Smith said Pocock was always &quot;charming and good company&quot;, adding: &quot;Ben touched so many people in his life that was cut so short.&quot; Father-of-two Cameron Dalziel, who is from South Africa but was travelling on a British passport, also died on flight MH17. The 43-year-old, described as &quot;one of the world&apos;s best rescue helicopter pilots&quot;, had moved to Malaysia last year.

The jet was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday when it was blown apart and fell in a shower of fiery wreckage over the village of Grabovo near the Ukraine-Russia border. &quot;European airlines also use the same route and traverse the same airspace. In the hours before the incident, a number of other passenger aircraft from different carriers used the same route,&quot; Liow told a press conference. He said there had been &quot;no last-minute instructions&quot; given to the pilots to change the route. Ukrainian authorities had banned aircraft from flying below 32,000ft. MH17 was cruising at 33,000ft \u2013 apparently still within range of the sophisticated surface-to-air weaponry that pro-Russia forces have been using recently to target Ukrainian military aircraft. All civilian flights have now been barred from the airspace over eastern Ukraine. Liow said the aircraft had a clean record and all systems were functioning normally. The crash has provoked anger among some Malaysians towards their government. &quot;First they lose a plane and then they fly another plane into a place they should never have been,&quot; said taxi driver Rajiv Raja, 45. &quot;Why would they do that?&quot; Malaysia Airlines said the flight plan had been approved by Eurocontrol, which designates routes in European airspace. &quot;The route over Ukrainian airspace where the incident occurred is commonly used for Europe to Asia flights. A flight from a different carrier was on the same route at the time of the MH17 incident, as were a number of other flights from other carriers in the days and weeks before.&quot; Many relatives of those on MH17 were too distraught to speak to reporters, and security was tightened at the hotels where many of the friends and family of the victims have been put up. &quot;He was really such a nice person, so intelligent, and we miss him so much,&quot; one woman said of a friend who had been studying in the Netherlands and was on his way back home to Malaysia for the holidays. &quot;The loss is just so deep, so deep inside, how do you explain it? Not many people can understand it.&quot; Zul Rusdi, an college lecturer, said he had lost six members of his family on MH17 - his cousin Ariza Ghazalee, 46, her husband, Tambi Jiee, 49, and their four children, aged 13-19. The family had been living and working in Kazakhstan for the past three years as Shell employees and had been transferred back to Malaysia. They had decided to take a holiday in Amsterdam to celebrate the transfer and were due to continue home to Kuching after landing in Kuala Lumpur. &quot;They loved being in a foreign country, the cultural differences, all of it, but they were very excited to be coming back to Malaysia after such a long time away,&quot; said Zul, who had last seen the family last March when they paid a visit to his mother who was in hospital in Kuala Lumpur. &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe it when I switched on the TV this morning. I was looking at Najib [Razak, the prime minister] making his press statement and I was so confused: is this MH17 or MH370? What plane is this? I couldn&apos;t believe it, I was shocked. It&apos;s made us very scared, it seems like something is not right. I&apos;m not going to accuse the government but \u2026 is it a conspiracy of some foreign elements who are [trying] to attack Malaysia? What does it mean? It&apos;s all very tragic.&quot; Zul said the most worrying aspect was the supposed involvement of separatists in the crash and what that would mean for the victims&apos; burial rites. &quot;We don&apos;t care if there is a war going on there, let them have it, but for us, for Muslims \u2013 for anyone in the world of all religions, really \u2013 it is so important that we have the remains of the bodies. How can we get the remains if the separatists are blocking the area? How can we ensure that our loved ones will have a proper burial? This is what hurts the most. I can handle the death. But please, let them have the dignity of a proper burial.&quot; While the two tragic incidents to have befallen Malaysia Airlines in the last four months may deter some from flying with them, many passengers at Kuala Lumpur were still checking in for their flights, saying goodbye to loved ones, calmly reading newspapers and chatting with friends. Hannis Hanarbek, a construction management student on a course at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia, was waiting with her brother in the main departures area and feeling calm about her flight back to Melbourne. &quot;I&apos;m a little scared, but I think it&apos;ll be OK,&quot; she said. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s God&apos;s fate.&quot; Relatives of the missing passengers and crew from MH370, who are presumed dead after the flight disappeared from radar not long after takeoff in March, told the Guardian that they shared the pain and grief of those who had lost friends and family on MH17, and that news of the crash had reopened little-healed wounds. &quot;It&apos;s quite difficult to explain, it&apos;s very heavy. After a while, everything simmers down a bit, but all the pain just came back again last night,&quot; said Rachel Sta Maria, whose cousin Patrick Francis Gomes was the in-flight supervisor on MH370. &quot;I&apos;m quite devastated, it&apos;s like, just shock. It&apos;s made me reflect back on what happened [to MH370], I just feel grief.&quot; Sta Maria said she felt no anger towards Malaysia Airlines. &quot;It&apos;s not their fault,&quot; she said, breaking up. &quot;We&apos;re just victims of circumstances.&quot;", "sentences": ["The jet was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday when it was blown apart and fell in a shower of fiery wreckage over the village of Grabovo near the Ukraine-Russia border.", "They had decided to take a holiday in Amsterdam to celebrate the transfer and were due to continue home to Kuching after landing in Kuala Lumpur."], "title": "Flight MH17 was following right route, says Malaysian minister", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17-route-minister", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Malaysia", "Air transport", "World news", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-18T17:30:59Z", "article": "The Malaysia Airlines help desk at Schiphol airport&apos;s terminal three remained emphatically closed on Friday morning, barricaded shut with additional movable walls.

Friday&apos;s front page of de Volkskrant newspaper showed a picture of the wreckage at the crash site, underneath the headline: &quot;One of the worst air disasters in Dutch history.&quot; Throughout the day, people left flowers and wrote their condolences into book outside the terminal. Herman Plukaard, an employee at one of the companies inside the airport, said he had wanted to lay down some flowers because he believed that he had served some of the people who died on the flight to Kuala Lumpur. &quot;We find it easy to watch the news and do nothing. But when innocent people die, some kind of action needs to be taken&quot;. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, who on Thursday night had sounded caution about jumping to conclusions, by Friday afternoon too was calling for consequences: &quot;Let us be clear: if it becomes clear that it was an attack, the perpetrators must be found and punished&quot;, he said at a press conference at the Ministry of Security and Justice in the Netherlands. &quot;That is something the victims and those they leave behind are entitled to.&quot; Yet overall the reaction to the tragedy in the Netherlands has been remarkable restrained. On Friday morning at 8am, passengers were queuing up to check into another Malaysia Airlines flight bound for Kuala Lumpur. One couple in their 20s, who didn&apos;t want to give their names, said they felt sad about what had happened, and admitted they were a little bit scared about boarding their flight. But they were determined not to give up on their holiday, a trip around Indonesia and Sumatra. Erik Elsenaar, an IT consultant waiting at Schiphol for his midday flight to Kuala Lumpur, told the Guardian he was feeling very calm: &quot;This is something that never, never happens, and it&apos;s unlikely to happen again. It is a tragedy, but it doesn&apos;t look like the attack was either directed at Holland or Malaysia Airlines. You can see here that they&apos;ve already doubled the security at check-in. They will probably triple the checks for bombs. It&apos;s definitely safer to travel now than it was to travel the day before yesterday.&quot; Elsenaar said Malaysia Airlines staff hadn&apos;t mentioned the accident to him during check-in. &quot;I expect this will add an hour extra to my flight, but that&apos;s it.&quot; All across Amsterdam, the Dutch flag was hanging at half mast. Floor Reukers and Alex van den Akker, two students having a cigarette break by one of the canals, said they were shocked because everyone seemed to know someone who had recently been on the same flight route or was planning to fly that way soon. &quot;My brother is flying to Kuala Lumpur in a few days,&quot; said Reukers, &quot;and a friend of mine flew the same way last week.&quot; Asked how they felt the Dutch government should react to the tragedy, Van den Akker said: &quot;What happened was awful, and we are all thinking of the victims. But we are not going to call for the government to go and catch the perpetrators or go to war. We are not America.&quot; The relatives of the crash victims have so far been largely sheltered from the attention of the press. On Thursday evening, about 80 next-of-kins first gathered inside a cafe inside the terminal and were then driven to a nearby hotel, where they were given more details about the disaster. The vice president of Malaysia Airlines, Huib Gorter, said at a press conference at Schiphol airport on Friday afternoon that it was paying out $5,000 (\u00a32,900) per passenger to provide immediate assistance to family members. The airline was looking into the feasibility of flying family members of the deceased out to the crash site in the Ukraine, Gorter said.", "sentences": ["&quot;I expect this will add an hour extra to my flight, but that&apos;s it.&quot; All across Amsterdam, the Dutch flag was hanging at half mast."], "title": "Dutch king offers condolences to relatives of people on flight MH17", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/dutch-king-willem-alexander-condolences-flight-mh17", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Netherlands", "Plane crashes", "Air transport", "Kuala Lumpur holidays", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-18T18:23:51Z", "article": "More flights that flew over or near eastern Ukraine departed from London Heathrow than for any other airport over the past seven days, according to flight radar data analysed by the Guardian. Seventy nine flights that were confirmed to have left from Heathrow were picked up by FlightRadar24 as having come within 86.4 miles of a point within the city centre of Donetsk - roughly 50 miles from where flight MH17 crashed last night. In total, 930 flights were detected to have entered the region but specific flight numbers were not available for 100 of them. The territory does just overlap with the Russian border so some flights could have just avoided entering Ukraine itself.       When you include other airports such as Manchester and Birmingham, the UK was the departure point for 90 of the flights. That means more than one in 10 of the aircraft where the flight number was confirmed came from the UK.      The data covers every flight which comes in an 86.4 mile radius of a point in Donetsk.    Amsterdam-Schiphol, where the crashed MH17 flight departed on Thursday morning was the source of 37 flights. Russia had more than any other country with 147. Although an average of more than 130 planes a day were detected in the runup to the crash, a look at the FlightRadar24 map now shows that flights over the region are now a lot sparser. Which airline operators were flying over the region? There were 86 planes that passed over the Donetsk region in the past week and flew under the AFL operator code, which is registered to Aeroflot. Singapore Airlines (SIA) flew 75, Ukraine International Airlines (AUI) flew 62, and German airline Lufthansa (DLH) flew 56.       Malaysia Airlines, the operator of the MH17 flight that was shot down on Thursday, was the next most frequent operator with 48 flights over the week. The Abu Dhabi-based airline Etihad said its planes did not fly over the nearby airspace. However, the FlightRadar24 data suggested that it had flown 26 flights over the region over the past week. In a statement provided to the Guardian Friday, Etihad said: &quot;On 17 July 2014, in the aftermath of the MH17 incident, we stated that we did not operate services over Ukrainian airspace. This was incorrect and we would like to apologise for this miscommunication. &quot;Following advice from relevant regulatory and airspace authorities in March this year, we implemented flight paths to avoid restricted airspace around the Crimean Peninsula extending out into the Black Sea. &quot;We continued to operate flights on air routes over Ukrainian airspace, which we were advised by the authorities, were safe. &quot;We can confirm that we have now suspended all flights over Ukrainian airspace.&quot; Where were the flights heading? The European Cockpits Association said: \u201cThe route flown by the lost Malaysian aircraft is the most common route for flights from Europe to South East Asia.\u201d  Although that cannot be confirmed just with this data, airports in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia were all included in the top ten arrival points. Thirty four flights travelling near Donetsk were bound for Kuala Lumpur International Airport. One of those was the ill-fated MH17.       Heathrow came joint-second for airport most of these flights were bound for with Indira Ghandhi International in Delhi. Changi aiport in Singapore had the most with 74.  Below is a count of how many flights were matched to each airline detected within 86.4 miles of Donetsk over the past seven days. You can sort it by number of flights or by alphabetical order.

You don\u2019t have to agree with the analyst who reckons \u201cnews is to the mind what sugar is to the body\u201d to see that reading of horror and foreboding hour by hour, day after day, can sap the soul. This week ended with a double dose, administered within the space of a few hours: Israel\u2019s ground incursion into Gaza and, more shocking because entirely unexpected, the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, killing all 298 on board. The different responses these events stir in those of us who are distant, and the strategies we devise to cope with them, say much about our behaviour as consumers of news. But they also go some way to determining our reaction as citizens, as constituent members of the amorphous body we call public, or even world, opinion. As I write, 18 of the 20 most-read articles on the Guardian website are about MH17. The entry into Gaza by Israeli forces stands at number 21. It\u2019s not hard to fathom why the Malaysian jet strikes the louder chord. As the preacher might put it, \u201cThere but for the grace of God go I.\u201d Stated baldly, most of us will never live in Gaza, but we know it could have been us boarding that plane in Amsterdam. Which is why there is a morbid fascination with tales of the passenger who changed flights at the last minute, thereby cheating death, or with the crew member who made the opposite move, hastily switching to MH17 at the final moment, taking a decision that would have seemed so trivial at the time but which cost him his life. When we read about the debris \u2013 the holiday guidebooks strewn over the Ukrainian countryside, the man found next to an iPhone, the boy with his seatbelt still on \u2013 our imaginations put us on that flight. Of course we have sympathy for the victims and their families. But our fear is for ourselves. The reports from Gaza stir a different feeling. When we read the Guardian\u2019s Peter Beaumont describe the sights he saw driving around the strip on Friday morning \u2013 three Palestinian siblings killed by an Israeli artillery shell that crashed into their bedroom, a father putting the remains of his two-year-old son into a plastic shopping bag \u2013 we are shaken by a different kind of horror. It is compassion for another human being, someone in a situation utterly different to ours. We don\u2019t worry that this might happen to us, as we now might when we contemplate an international flight over a war zone. Our reaction is directed not inward, but outward. Not that that makes one situation easier to contemplate than the other. They are both unbearable. And so we devise coping strategies. The first is the attempt to make sense of what we have seen \u2013 to construct a story that allows us to believe that the world is not, natural disasters apart, a place of random catastrophe and anarchy. And, usually, the first building block in this effort is blame. If we know whom to blame, then suddenly life is not quite so arbitrary: if only X or Y had behaved differently or, better still, had not been around, then we might be safe. So within minutes, even before anybody had had a chance to absorb what had happened to those 298 people, journalists and politicians were asking who was responsible. The very act of pointing the finger at pro-Russian separatists brings some relief. If we can state with confidence that it\u2019s their fault and their fault alone, then we do not face the tougher possibility: that life in this new, globally interconnected world is terribly fragile. In Gaza, this same impulse creates the urge to anoint clear-cut goodies and baddies, a side to cheer and a side to boo. Once we know whom to support, then, we imagine, we are halfway to knowing how this problem might be solved: all that need happen is that the good guys prevail. The usual practice is to say that the hero is the victim, defined as whoever is suffering the most at that moment, with the other side declared the villain. So in Gaza we look at the wildly lopsided death tolls \u2013 nearly 300 Palestinians and two Israelis killed these past nine days \u2013 and conclude that Israel must be completely in the wrong and Palestinians completely in the right. But then Israelis remind you that millions of their own civilians are under constant Hamas rocket fire and that recent years have done little to convince them that, even if Israel were to lift its siege of Gaza, those rockets would stop. So while seeing faraway conflicts in black and white might be a helpful coping strategy, it doesn\u2019t always fit the reality or help solve the problem. Others find a different way to handle all this horror. They also look for someone to blame, but their search starts closer to home. They work on the assumption that whatever nightmares are unfolding in Ukraine, Gaza or elsewhere, they are ultimately the result of our own action, or inaction. So it must have been US-led advances in eastern Europe that made Russia feel so threatened that it had to annex a chunk of its neighbour\u2019s territory \u2013 or it must be American and British support for Israel that lies at the root of the current trouble. Arguments of this kind can sometimes have merit: it\u2019s quite true that if the US truly decided that Israel\u2019s 47-year occupation of Palestinian territory was no longer acceptable, that would bring change. But the impulse behind such arguments is not always coolly analytical. Sometimes the urge to say \u201cthis is our fault\u201d seems to owe more to a desire to exert a kind of control. For if every bad thing in the world is the fault of America (backed by Britain), then it\u2019s surely so much easier to fix. Of course, there is another way to cope. It\u2019s the one that most of us deploy most often. It is to look away. That\u2019s what we have done with Syria, where the killing goes on, day in and day out. On Thursday 115 people were killed, 25 of them civilians, in a single clash in Homs province. But none of us was watching. Looking away is certainly comfortable. The trouble is, that option is not always available, as MH17 has proved. We might have wanted to avert our gaze from the civil war in Ukraine. But now we can\u2019t.

That total is much lower than the figure of 100 initially suggested as having been on the Boeing 777. Chris Beyrer, the incoming president of the International Aids Society, said the body had been trying to confirm exactly how many delegates were on the plane. &quot;We think the actual number is much smaller,&quot; he told the Washington Post. As the airline has not released a passenger manifest, organisers have tried to obtain details from sources in various countries. Although there may have been some delegates on the flight whom they were unaware of, Beyrer said it appeared that the total was &quot;smaller than what has been reported&quot;. About 12,000 delegates are expected to travel to Melbourne for the five-day conference, the largest of its kind in the world, which starts on Sunday. Joep Lange, the former president of the International Aids Society and a notable HIV researcher, was one of the 298 people killed when the plane crashed after being struck by a surface-to-air missile. Bill Clinton, who is due to speak at the conference on Wednesday, described the crash as &quot;awful&quot;, adding that the delegates who died were &quot;really in a way martyrs to the cause that we are going to Australia to talk about&quot;. A total of 28 Australians were killed, including a grandfather from Western Australia and three of his grandchildren. Ten people from Victoria were killed, giving the state the highest death toll. Husband and wife Albert and Maree Rizk, from Sunbury, north of Melbourne, are understood to have been returning to Australia on the flight after a month-long holiday in Europe. Mr Rizk was a director of the local branch of the Raine and Horne real estate agency. Elaine Teoh and Emiel Mahler, both 27, were travelling to a wedding in Malaysia. Teoh, originally from Penang in Malaysia, and Mahler, a Dutch national, lived in Melbourne, where they worked in the finance sector. Frankie Davison, a teacher at Toorak College, Mount Eliza, and her husband Liam, were passengers on the flight. They left behind two children, Milly and Sam. Nine Queenslanders died. Roger and Jill Guard, both doctors from Toowoomba, were believed to be returning home after holidaying following a medical conference. Roger Guard was director of pathology at Toowoomba hospital, while Jill worked as a GP. Heidi Sidelik, a woman in her late 50s from the Gold Coast, was reportedly travelling home from a friend&apos;s wedding in Europe on flight MH17, according to the Gold Coast Bulletin. She moved to Burleigh from Melbourne four years ago but was originally from Adelaide. There are also reports of a Sunshine Coast couple and four people from the Brisbane suburb of Indooroopilly dying in the tragedy. Meanwhile, a Perth couple lost all three children after sending them home from a holiday in Amsterdam with their grandfather so that they would not miss the start of the school term. Keen sailor Nick Norris, 68, and his three grandchildren \u2013 12-year-old Mo, Evie, 10, and Otis, 8 \u2013 were among at least seven West Australians on the MH17. Norris, managing director of management consulting firm Collaborative Systemic Change, is survived by his wife Lindy, an academic at Murdoch University, and their four children. The couple&apos;s son Brack said that his sister Rin Maslin and her husband Anthony Maslin had stayed behind in Amsterdam while Norris took his grandchildren home in time for the new school term. &quot;They were staying a few more days, which is why the kids were with my dad,&quot; Brack Norris told ABC radio. Nick Norris had been a member of the South of Perth Yacht Club for 16 years and his grandchildren had recently joined. General manager David Harries said the club was an immense part of the family&apos;s life. &quot;The members of SoPYC are shocked by this tragic, senseless loss,&quot; he said. A member of the club said Norris was friendly, chatty and a very enthusiastic sailor: &quot;He was just a lovely bloke. He&apos;ll be missed.&quot; The Perth-based parents of a technology company founder fear that their daughter has been killed on the flight. Fatima Dyczynski, the Amsterdam-based chief executive and founder of Xoterra Space, a hi-tech start-up company, was expected to be on MH17 and cannot be reached. Mosman Park-based doctor Jerzy Dyczynski and his wife arrived in Perth on an AirAsia flight from Kuala Lumpur late on Friday afternoon saying they did not know the whereabouts of their daughter. A Catholic Education spokeswoman confirmed that a female teacher from WA was on the plane, while a WA department of agriculture and food spokeswoman announced that a male staff member was also on the flight. The man was reportedly travelling with his wife. Three people from New South Wales who were on flight MH17 were killed, including Sister Philomene Tiernan, a nun who taught at Kincoppal at Rose Bay. Among those paying tribute were communications minister Malcolm Turnbull, who said on Twitter: &quot;Many women incl my wife Lucy &amp; daughter Daisy were inspired by the love of Sr Phil Tiernan RSCJ&quot;. Retired Wollongong couple Michael and Carol Clancy, believed to be in their 60s, were on board after returning from a three-week European holiday. The school where Mr Clancy had been a teacher \u2013 Albion Park, south of Wollongong - sent a letter home to parents. Bryce Brown, one of Clancy&apos;s former students at Albion Park public school, remembered his mentor as a kind, quirky man. &quot;He used to play the Indiana Jones theme song when he walked into a classroom,&quot; Brown said of his former year six teacher. &quot;I got really sick one night on school camp and he sat up with me. He was unreal.&quot; One passenger on the plane was from the Australian Capital Territory. Mother of two Liliane Derden, 50, from Hall in the north of Canberra. She worked for the National Health and Medical Research Council, whose staff expressed deep sadness at the loss of a valued colleague and friend. Three people from the Northern Territory were killed. Emma Bell, aged in her 20s, moved last year from Lithgow, west of Sydney, to teach at the Maningrida community, 500km east of Darwin. She was returning from holiday to start the new school term.

All sides have called for a thorough and impartial investigation into what caused the crash, which killed all 283 passengers and 15 crew on board MH17, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. However, the first group of international investigators on the scene were involved in a tense standoff with the armed separatists who control the crash site at Grabovo. A unit of heavily armed rebels blocked the 30-strong team from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), cordoning off a large part of the crash site. The inspectors retreated after an hour-long standoff, having been unable to gain access. They were sent on their way by warning shots fired by the rebel unit commander. &quot;We will keep coming back tomorrow and the next day and the next day,&quot; said OSCE spokesman Michael Bociurkiw. &quot;Tomorrow will be a crunch day. There are a lot of experts from the Netherlands and Malaysia gathering in Kiev as well as relatives. The bodies are starting to bloat and decay. An expert team is clearly needed. There is a lot to be done in a short amount of time.&quot; In Washington, Obama called for a full, impartial investigation and said the tragedy should cause people to &quot;snap their heads together&quot; and stop playing games in Ukraine. In veiled criticism of the lack of European support for US-led economic sanctions against Russia, Obama said the loss of so many European lives should serve as a wake-up call for Europe. He said while it was too early to be completely sure who was responsible and what their motives were, the US was certain that a missile fired from within territory controlled by Russian separatists brought down the jet. He stopped short of directly blaming Moscow for the tragedy, but said it was down to Vladimir Putin to end the violence that has plagued Ukraine for months. &quot;It is not possible for the separatists to function the way they&apos;re functioning \u2026 without sophisticated equipment and training, and that is coming from Russia,&quot; said Obama. &quot;If Mr Putin makes a decision that we are not going to allow heavy armaments and the flow of fighters into Ukraine \u2026 then it will stop.&quot; In the UK the government joined the US in blaming pro-Russian separatists. A No 10 spokeswoman said: &quot;While it is too early to be categoric about the cause of the disaster, the growing weight of evidence suggests that MH17 was shot down by a surface to air missile and that this was fired from near Torez, in territory controlled by the separatists.&quot; Russia, however, did not appear eager to disown the rebels, to whom it has been publicly sympathetic and in private supplied logistical and military backing \u2013 or at least turned a blind eye to their provision across the Russia-Ukraine border. Russia&apos;s ambassador to the UN, while not addressing the specific claim of how MH17 was shot down, said Russia &quot;fully blames Kiev&quot; for all violence in the region. In Moscow, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed claims from Kiev that Russia was behind the attack, saying that he had &quot;hardly heard a single true statement come from Kiev in the past few months&quot;. Lavrov&apos;s deputy, Sergei Ryabkov accused the Americans of having made up their minds without studying the facts, and insisted that the US that was to blame. Washington, said Ryabkov, was responsible for &quot;stirring up political instability, provoking an anti-constitutional seizure of power and supporting anti-Russian politicians \u2026 The US should think about the consequences of its actions.&quot; Russia&apos;s state-controlled media suggested that a Ukrainian jet or missile system had shot down the plane, with a source in Russia&apos;s defence ministry claiming that Moscow had picked up missile radar activity on Thursday coming from Ukrainian bases. Other more fanciful conspiracy theories were floated, including the idea that the attack was carried out by the Ukrainian army in error, thinking it was Putin&apos;s plane. Rebel websites suggested that the bodies discovered at the crash site were &quot;long dead&quot; and speculated the plane could have been MH370, which went missing earlier this year, hidden and then re-used to stage a &quot;provocation&quot;. While Obama admitted that the US does not know exactly what happened, amid the ludicrous theories the circumstantial evidence did appear to point increasingly to an accidental attack by separatists who thought they were shooting at a Ukrainian military jet. If the missile was fired by rebels, it is unclear if they obtained the launch system from Russia or seized it from a Ukrainian army base. Video posted on YouTube claiming to show part of a Buk system on the move towards the Russian border could not be verified. Ukraine&apos;s foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, however, insisted that recordings released by Ukraine&apos;s SBU security services on Thursday of separatist fighters admitting they had downed a passenger liner were &quot;absolutely genuine&quot;. Elsewhere in the east, the fighting between Kiev forces and separatists continued. There were reports that at least 20 civilians had been killed by shelling in the city of Luhansk. The 298 people aboard MH17 came from nearly a dozen nations, with at least 189 of the dead Dutch citizens. A large number were heading to a conference on HIV/Aids. Murdo Bijl, a Dutch Aids advocate who knew many of those on board, said: &quot;Truly beautiful, inspiring, committed, smart and compassionate people have been brutally taken away from us. The world and the Aids field will miss these brilliant doctors, advocates, researchers and friends.&quot; The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, who on Thursday night had urged caution about jumping to conclusions, by Friday afternoon was calling for consequences. &quot;Let us be clear: if it becomes clear that it was an attack, the perpetrators must be found and punished,&quot; he said at a press conference at the ministry of security and justice. &quot;That is something the victims and those they leave behind are entitled to.&quot; Yet, over all, the reaction to the tragedy in the Netherlands has been remarkably restrained. morning at 8am, passengers were queuing up to check into another Malaysia Airways flight bound for Kuala Lumpur. One couple in their 20s, who didn&apos;t want to give their names, said they felt sad about what had happened, and admitted they were scared about boarding their flight. But they were determined not to give up on their holiday, a trip around Indonesia and Sumatra. Erik Elsenaar, an IT consultant waiting at Schiphol for his midday flight to Kuala Lumpur, said he was feeling very calm: &quot;This is something that never, never happens, and it&apos;s unlikely to happen again. It is a tragedy, but it doesn&apos;t look like the attack was either directed at Holland or Malaysia Airlines. You can see here that they&apos;ve already doubled the security at check-in. They will probably triple the checks for bombs. It&apos;s definitely safer to travel now than it was to travel the day before yesterday.&quot; There were nine UK citizens among the dead. A British diplomat in Kiev said if any of the relatives of the nine UK citizens killed in the crash came to Ukraine, they would be given all assistance required, even as far as attempts to journey to the crash site, &quot;within the limits of what is safe, possible and accessible&quot;. A video-conference took place on Thursday evening between the separatists and the Ukrainian president&apos;s representative, former president Leonid Kuchma, which included mediation from the OSCE and the Russian ambassador to Ukraine. It agreed that the separatists would grant access to the crash site for international investigators. However, Friday&apos;s standoff with the OSCE shows that unfettered access could be tricky to achieve, and the logistics of issues such as retrieving and properly storing bodies, as well as sifting through the evidence, remain unclear.", "sentences": ["All sides have called for a thorough and impartial investigation into what caused the crash, which killed all 283 passengers and 15 crew on board MH17, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur."], "title": "MH17: rebels block access to part of site of crash as evidence against them grows", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/mh17-crash-pro-russia-rebels-block-access-ukraine", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Ukraine", "Europe", "World news", "Russia", "Vladimir Putin", "Barack Obama", "United Nations", "Air transport", "Netherlands"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-19T06:00:31Z", "article": "Anyone who has strolled down Shoreditch High Street in east London in the past few years will probably have seen John Dolan drawing, with a cup for coins on the pavement beside his dog. A tourist from New Zealand browsing an art gallery nearby is typical of many of us: she stops in surprise when she sees a sketch by Dolan on display. &quot;I saw this guy in the street the other day, just opposite,&quot; she says. &quot;I wish I&apos;d stopped now and talked to him.&quot; Dolan, until recently a homeless heroin addict, is now a &quot;famous artist&quot; as he puts it when he rushes into the Howard Griffin gallery, soaking from the rain. He has a sellout exhibition, a second just opened and a new memoir, which could become a bestseller. As he is well aware, the interest in his intricate drawings of London buildings, and of his dog, George, is piqued by his remarkable change of fortune. This poses two questions: where did it all go wrong, and where did it all go right? The answers, as many people find, are bound up with family. Unusually, however, one member of Dolan&apos;s family is particularly crucial: his dog, George. Dolan&apos;s life has been transformed since Richard Howard-Griffin, a street art devotee and gallery owner put on an exhibition of Dolan&apos;s drawings last autumn. But Dolan, a charming and rather delicate man, is still shaped by his past. Most of his teeth are missing and he carries the vulnerability of someone in the early stage of recovering from many traumas. Surprisingly, perhaps, his early childhood was happy. The son of Gerry, a dustman, and Dot, a cleaner, he grew up in a council flat within sight of St Paul&apos;s. His brothers, David and Malcolm, and sisters, Jackie and Marilyn, were much older, and Dolan was a cheeky youngest child, spoilt with toys, sweets and comics, which he would spend hours trying to copy, drawing in his bedroom. Then, aged 10, his world was turned upside down. Gerry, his authoritarian but loving father, abruptly told him that his parents were in fact his grandparents: his &quot;sister&quot;, Marilyn, was his biological mother; his father a lad called Jimmy he had met once or twice. &quot;I think I was too young to be told that, and it knocked me for six, it really did,&quot; says Dolan. &quot;It had a huge impact on me. I went right off the rails. I was a proper problem child.&quot; Dolan remembers telling himself that nothing would change and outwardly it didn&apos;t: Dot and Gerry were still his mum and dad and Marilyn remained a distant figure. But Dolan&apos;s cheekiness became delinquency. He was obese \u2013 13 stone, when he was nine \u2013 and bullied at school. &quot;I hated school, absolutely hated it.&quot; So he began to play truant, sniffing glue, throwing milk bottles from tower blocks, getting chased by police. Faced with this misbehaviour, Gerry threatened to put him in a children&apos;s home or send him to live with Jimmy, Dolan&apos;s biological father. Dolan had met &quot;Uncle Jimmy&quot; and he was fine, but those threats &quot;had a huge impact on me, more than I realised then&quot;. The art teacher was the only person at school who had time for Dolan and he left without any qualifications. He got occasional work for Jimmy Dolan&apos;s secondhand office furniture business but never found what Dot and Gerry called a proper job. &quot;I didn&apos;t have the confidence to get myself a job,&quot; he says. &quot;I fell into a heavy depression.&quot; He also fell into six months at Feltham young offenders&apos; institution: a fat petty thief, who forged signatures in savings books, was shoved alongside murderers and gangsters. When he came out, Dot and Gerry wouldn&apos;t take him back. He was homeless. He took up burglary, targeting commercial properties (&quot;I wouldn&apos;t ever break into anyone&apos;s house&quot;). West End sandwich shops on a Sunday night with a weekend&apos;s takings in the till were particularly profitable. &quot;My criminality was rife,&quot; he says. Dot and Gerry&apos;s home was repeatedly raided by the police and not long after one raid, Dot died of cancer. Gerry never really forgave Dolan \u2013 &quot;He always said if it had never happened she might still be here now&quot; \u2013 but the older man needed help and Dolan moved home. Grieving and lonely, Gerry raged at Dolan \u2013 &quot;You useless piece of shit.&quot; He was typical of his generation, &quot;A real shouter and growler,&quot; says Dolan. &quot;He used to really tear into me. He shattered my confidence. By the time I was in my late 20s, I was a wreck.&quot; According to Dolan, one of his brothers recently said he blamed Gerry for the Dolan&apos;s delinquency. After a decade in and out of prison and now abused by his angry, ailing grandfather, Dolan sank deeper into depression and tried heroin. &quot;It was like someone was giving me the biggest hug I&apos;d ever had in my entire life,&quot; he writes in his memoirs. &quot;I hate to say it,&quot; he tells me, &quot;but for the first few years the class-A drug use really did help my depression but in a negative way \u2013 I became addicted and it came to rule my life.&quot; When Gerry died in 1997, all Dolan&apos;s family, except his sister Jackie, severed contact. Dolan became homeless again when he failed to pay his rent and by 2009 had more than 300 convictions, 30 stints in prison and an arthritic ankle. He got a council bedsit and then George, a young Staffordshire bull terrier, entered his life. Dolan had befriended a young homeless couple and when they were offered a flat they had to give up George, acquired when a drunk had swapped him for a strong can of lager.     John Dolan, aged five - he grew up in Islington, north London.      Dolan was terrified to be entrusted with George, his first ever responsibility. &quot;How was I going to cope with him? I couldn&apos;t even cope with myself,&quot; he says. But he&apos;d loved the family dog, Butch, as a boy, and he noticed how George always looked him in the eye when he talked. They bonded and Dolan had a stark realisation: if he went to prison again, he would lose George. So he gave up crime. &quot;It was only because I had the animal and he&apos;s a responsibility,&quot; he says, stroking George. &quot;He&apos;s like my child in a sense and I feel obliged to keep a roof over his head and keep him warm.&quot; Unlikely to ever find a job, he felt, Dolan decided to try begging. &quot;I threw on an old jacket, just for the fun of it.&quot; He pauses. &quot;I found it really tough and degrading.&quot; But he hit on a winning sales technique: placing the cup in front of a charming (now well-trained) dog. You&apos;re not stupid, I joke. &quot;And I don&apos;t claim to be,&quot; laughs Dolan. Then he started drawing again. &quot;Sitting there holding out my hand was so embarrassing, so degrading. I didn&apos;t like to look at people as they went past. I picked up the pen mainly so I could bury my head in a drawing pad.&quot; He started drawing the buildings opposite, over and over again, to recapture and improve his childhood skill. It took him about three months &quot;to get into a groove&quot; and then he started selling his drawings to passers-by for a few quid. He was commissioned to do some drawings for a book, Shoreditch Unbound, alongside other local residents such as Tracey Emin and Gilbert and George. Eventually, a gallery director, Richard Howard-Griffin, asked if he would draw some large streetscapes for him. &quot;Griff&quot; had the smart idea to invite other street artists, including ROA and Thierry Noir (who drew on the Berlin Wall) to draw on Dolan&apos;s pictures. These collaborations sold for \u00a350,000. In the run-up to last autumn&apos;s exhibition, Dolan finally visited a doctor, obtained a prescription and weaned himself off heroin. Going through withdrawal was &quot;the most painful thing I&apos;ve been through&quot;, he writes. Does he worry he might relapse, especially now he has money? &quot;It&apos;s easy to go back to it but you&apos;ve got to not want to go back to it. No positives will come from taking it, no matter how much money you&apos;ve got,&quot; he says. &quot;Not that I&apos;ve got much.&quot; Dolan&apos;s pre-exhibition nerves were greater than most. He invited his family and hoped to see them for the first time in years. &quot;I owe my family an apology for the way I grew up,&quot; he says. &quot;Finally succeeding and having a show was a &apos;sorry&apos; to my family and my parents who brought me up so lovingly and responsibly.&quot; He was delighted that Jackie, Malcolm and David all showed up with their families. In the months since, he has seen them &quot;all the time&quot; and has especially appreciated spending time with Malcolm. &quot;He was the one who hated my guts the most because he was the closest to my mum, my nan,&quot; he says. What about his biological parents? Although he hasn&apos;t had direct contact with Jimmy recently, Jimmy posted a nice, rather sad message below an online interview with Dolan: &quot;hello john good to c u getting on well take care dad.&quot; Dolan is not in touch with his biological mother, Marilyn. &quot;She&apos;s had her chance,&quot; he says quietly. Is he angry with her? &quot;It is what it is. She was a product of her time, a young girl growing up in the 60s. She was a teenager, she made a mistake. I don&apos;t hold it against her.&quot; At the heart of Dolan&apos;s family is George. &quot;I feel like he&apos;s a guardian angel. If it hadn&apos;t been for him I&apos;d have never picked up my pen,&quot; he says, stroking his companion. George is seven now, and looks in excellent shape, as does Dolan who has joined a gym although he hasn&apos;t yet plucked up the courage to go. John Dolan is famous in east London, does charity work for the Big Issue Foundation and Unicef and is off to Los Angeles for another exhibition (he&apos;s only been abroad twice, to Bologne and Amsterdam). What about the big-budget movie? One Hollywood producer has already offered &quot;stupid money&quot;. And? &quot;He didn&apos;t offer us enough,&quot; says Dolan with a grin. He is ambitious for his art but rather more cautious about his personal life. Would he like a girlfriend and children? &quot;I&apos;ve not long come off the streets. My old way of life has only just changed,&quot; he says carefully. &quot;A girlfriend in time, I can see that happening.&quot; Given his success, I&apos;m surprised that he still sits on the street and draws. He is happier than ever and yet he admits his story is not quite happy-ever-after. &quot;I suffer depression really badly and sometimes I just have a bad day and I need to get out of the flat \u2013 get some fresh air and see people.&quot; Does he like himself more now? He pauses. &quot;A little bit,&quot; he says. &quot;But I&apos;ve got to get my teeth fixed. Next chance I get, I&apos;m going to get that done.&quot; \u2022 John Dolan&apos;s exhibition, John and George, is at the Howard Griffin Gallery London E1, until 17 August, howardgriffingallery.com.", "sentences": ["John Dolan is famous in east London, does charity work for the Big Issue Foundation and Unicef and is off to Los Angeles for another exhibition (he&apos;s only been abroad twice, to Bologne and Amsterdam)."], "title": "John Dolan: from homeless addict to street artist and author", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/19/john-dolan-homeless-addict-to-artist-and-author", "tags": ["Family", "Street art", "Homelessness", "Drugs", "Society", "Parents and parenting", "Grandparents and grandparenting", "Art and design", "Books", "Autobiography and memoir", "Art", "Art and design", "Social exclusion", "Housing", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-19T08:04:26Z", "article": "Ukraine and pro-Russia rebels are holding talks on setting up a security zone around the crash site of a Malaysian jet that was apparently shot down in the separatist east. Ensuring the security of the site, where all 298 passengers were killed when the Boeing 777 crashed, is crucial to preserving evidence needed to piece together what, and who, brought it down.  The head of the Ukrainian security service head, Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, said in televised remarks that the talks had agreed a 20km security zone &quot;so that Ukraine could fulfil the most important thing - identify the bodies hand them over to relatives&quot; but a senior official of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&apos;s Republic, said no agreement had been reached. A spokesman for the OSCE security watchdog, Michael Bociurkiw, said he was not aware of any agreement yet on the security zone, but this was &quot;definitely one of the top issues&quot;. The talks come as experts from the UK and Malaysia arrive in Kiev to assist a Ukrainian-led investigation into how Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was brought down. Downing Street said six investigators from the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch would join the growing international probe into exactly how the plane came to crash, killing 298 people, including 10 Britons, nearly 200 Dutch passengers and 80 children.  The Foreign Office has also sent extra consular staff to Ukraine and the Metropolitan Police is liaising with international partners to send specialist officers to the country to assist with the recovery, identification and repatriation of those killed.  Malaysia\u2019s transport minister Liow Tiong Lai is heading to Kiev tonight to assist in the MH17 investigation and would be joining a Malaysian team that arrived in Ukraine early on Saturday morning. There is growing international condemnation of pro-Russian separatists for the incident, with the United States both pointing the finger of blame at the militias. Diplomatic efforts to secure a full investigation through the United Nations were also growing and putting pressure on Russia to assist in the effort. China\u2019s president Xi Jinping called for a \u201cfair and objective\u201d investigation into the disaster.&quot;I hope that a fair and objective probe will be carried out to establish the truth as early as possible,\u201d he said on a visit to Argentina late on Friday. It echoed calls from Australian prime minister Tony Abbott for a full and impartial investigation. But while the US, UK and Australia have said that the plane was probably downed by a surface-to-air-missile from a separatist-held area, China has avoided discussing the issue of responsibility. Downing Street said it appeared &quot;increasingly likely&quot; that the catastrophe was the result of a surface-to-air missile fired from near Torez, in territory controlled by rebels seeking closer ties to Moscow. David Cameron earlier insisted that those responsible for bringing down the airliner must be &quot;brought to account&quot; amid deepening tensions with Moscow.  People from almost a dozen nations - young holidaymakers, students, entire families and scientists - were aboard the doomed flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.  Those living near the crash site between the villages of Rozsypne and Hrabove have described debris \u2013 parts of the stricken plane, luggage, personal belongings and even bodies \u2013 falling from the sky around them, thudding into fields, gardens and homes.  Among the British victims were Newcastle United fans John Alder, who was in his 60s, and Liam Sweeney, 28, who were travelling to New Zealand to watch the football team&apos;s pre-season tour.  Glenn Thomas, 49, a press officer at the World Health Organisation (WHO) and former BBC journalist, Loughborough University student Ben Pocock, reportedly 20, and Leeds University student Richard Mayne, 20, from Leicestershire, were also on board. Around 30 officials, the majority from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, arrived at the crash yesterday, about 25 miles from the Russian border, and were allowed a cursory inspection of the site while guarded by pro-Russia rebels.  The United Nations security council yesterday approved a statement calling for a &quot;full, thorough and independent international investigation&quot; into the crash.  UK national security adviser Sir Kim Darroch chaired an emergency meeting with officials from across Whitehall, including police and representatives from the intelligence agencies, to assess the situation. Cameron described the catastrophe as an &quot;absolutely appalling, shocking, horrific incident&quot; that &quot;cannot be allowed to stand&quot;.  A No 10 spokeswoman said: &quot;While it is too early to be categoric about the cause of the disaster, the growing weight of evidence suggests that MH17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile and that this was fired from near Torez, in territory controlled by the separatists.  &quot;This is backed up by claims made by separatist leaders on social media, and later removed, to have shot down an aircraft that they thought belonged to the Ukrainian military.  &quot;On this basis we assess that, without compelling information to the contrary, it is increasingly likely that MH17 was shot down by a separatist missile.&quot;  Obama said separatists had shot down Ukrainian planes in the region and claimed those actions could not have been carried out without Russian support.  He said: &quot;Set aside what&apos;s happened with respect to the Malaysian airliner, a group of separatists cannot shoot down military transport planes or, they claim, shoot down fighter jets without sophisticated equipment and sophisticated training and that&apos;s coming from Russia.  &quot;We don&apos;t yet know exactly what happened with respect to Malaysia Airlines, although obviously we are beginning to draw some conclusions given the nature of the shot that was fired. There are only certain types of anti-aircraft missiles that can reach up 30,000ft and shoot down a passenger jet.&quot;  At an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, US ambassador Samantha Power said Washington could not rule out the possibility that Russia offered help to separatists to launch the missile, believed to be an SA-11.  Chinese state media said that China\u2019s UN envoy Liu Jieyi told Friday\u2019s Security Council meeting: &quot;Our priority now is to establish facts. Pending that, it is not advisable to jump to any conclusion, make any assumptions or trade accusations. We support conducting an independent, just and objective investigation of the incident. &quot;We also call upon all the parties to offer coordination and cooperation in the process of the investigation.\u201d China and Russia frequently vote together at the UN security council - vetoing sanctions against Syria, for example. In other cases, they have chosen neither to support nor reject the other\u2019s position; when Russia vetoed a resolution declaring the referendum on Crimean secession illegal this spring, China abstained. Cameron and Obama agreed to &quot;keep up the pressure&quot; on Russia to engage in the Ukraine peace process and called for action to ensure the separatists grant investigators access to the crash site.  A No 10 spokeswoman said last night: &quot;The Prime Minister spoke to President Obama this evening about the MH17 disaster. They discussed their respective assessments of the incident, including the increasing likelihood that the plane was brought down by a missile fired from territory controlled by the separatists.  &quot;They both agreed that an independent investigation must get under way as soon as possible and that all countries should engage to ensure that pro- Russian separatists grant investigators secure and unhindered access to the crash site. Those responsible must be held to account.  &quot;They also discussed the further steps taken by the US and EU this week to make clear to Russia that there will be costs if they do not substantively engage in a peaceful resolution to the crisis and they agreed that to keep up the pressure in the weeks ahead if there is no progress towards de-escalation.&quot;  Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee and former foreign secretary, said the West had been &quot;timid&quot; in its dealings with Mr Putin. &quot;Putin is an opportunist, he is not a fanatic, he is a cool opportunist and if the West only reacts in a timid way to the annexation of Crimea it&apos;s not surprising that he is testing to see how much further he can go,&quot; Sir Malcolm said.  He raised the prospect that it could have been a Russian finger on the trigger of the missile system which downed flight MH17.  &quot;There is not just the question as to whether the attack on the aircraft came from rebels in eastern Ukraine, there will then be a secondary question - but perhaps an even more important one - who was it that was actually controlling the missile launchers?  &quot;Was it the Ukrainian rebels or might it have been Russian special forces?&quot;  He said that was &quot;not inconceivable&quot; and added: &quot;We know that there are large number of so-called Russian &apos;volunteers&apos;, who are actually soldiers not wearing uniforms, they could have been controlling the missile launchers themselves rather than simply training the rebels.&quot;", "sentences": ["People from almost a dozen nations - young holidaymakers, students, entire families and scientists - were aboard the doomed flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur."], "title": "MH17: Kiev and rebels hold talks to set up security zone around crash site", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/19/mh17-british-experts-ukraine-assist-investigation", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "UK news", "David Cameron", "China", "Xi Jinping", "Asia Pacific", "Ukraine", "United Nations", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-19T18:49:28Z", "article": "Two days after Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, the road near the village of Grabovo, where the aircraft crashed, is still lined with bodies. Rescue workers, most of them of unknown provenance, are slowly moving corpses from where they hit the ground and piling them on the side of the road. The victims are then covered with black tarpaulins. Beside them, the belongings of the dead passengers have been piled in heaps: dozens of suitcases, rucksacks, a red summer hat, a broken laptop and a stuffed toy monkey. After each foray into the fields, workers clean their shoes with sticks because the ground is sodden from persistent rain. What will happen to the bodies now, to the sons, daughters, siblings, husbands and wives of grieving relatives around the world? No one really seems to know. At Grabovo, the scene is one of utter confusion. Men in masks arrive and depart in fleets of cars, including one painted with the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag, supposedly from the government emergencies ministry. All the men hold guns. &quot;You are now at the place where the warfare is going on, so people with weapons shouldn&apos;t embarrass you,&quot; said the rebel commander, who gave his nom de guerre as Grumpy. He added that the corpses would probably be carried to the mortuaries at Snezhnoe or Donetsk, but he didn&apos;t know for sure. There have been Ukrainian claims that several bodies went missing during the night. While most of the corpses have been covered with tarpaulins, some body parts were shovelled into sacks. The smell at the site, as the heat of the Ukrainian summer takes its toll, is becoming unbearable. Ukraine&apos;s foreign ministry has said it will bring the bodies to the eastern city of Kharkiv for autopsies, and has promised to set up information centres and provide free accommodation for relatives. But in the chaos of the crash site, this seems an unlikely scenario: there is no sign that the broad access promised by the rebels to the crash site is actually being granted. A spokesman for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said that his team had &quot;evolving access&quot; to the site on Saturday. When I first arrived on Saturday, two men in military fatigues at the roadside, armed with Kalashnikovs, were blocking access to the crash site itself. &quot;The experts and investigators of the prosecutor general are now working there,&quot; I was told by one. The international community is unlikely to be impressed by these endeavours, or by an investigation that is being carried out by the &quot;prosecutor general&quot; of the People&apos;s Republic of Donetsk \u2013 the quasi-statelet that has existed here only since referendums earlier this year. Indeed, many suspect the rebels of engaging in a cover-up to hide their own involvement in the destruction of the Malaysian Airlines flight. On Friday, the OSCE team was barred from the site, and on Saturday the international monitoring mission, which arrived again in a convoy of white cars, was initially turned back by Grumpy and his men. &quot;Two-thirds of the OSCE observers work for intelligence of European countries or the US,&quot; he claimed, repeating his distrust for all western monitors \u2013 a constant rebel refrain throughout the conflict in east Ukraine. Two sets of OSCE monitors have been kidnapped and held hostage at various points over the past few months by rebels. However, after brief negotiations and a nervy standoff, the observers were allowed in to see the crash site. Together with journalists, they were permitted to walk along the road but were warned \u2013 by dozens of armed people who were tracking them from the nearby fields \u2013not to leave the tarmac. Several bodies, badly disfigured and still uncovered, lay across their path. According to Aleksey Megrin, the leader of the rescue workers, around 190 bodies had already been picked up by his men. &quot;We are finding bodies and bringing them to the place where rebels tell us to bring them,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&apos;t know what kind of police are working here: Ukrainian or Russian.&quot; Several times, rebels shot into the air to warn journalists who were getting too near to the bodies lying around them. On Friday the rebels had also fired warning shots at the OSCE team to prevent them from getting too close to the wreckage. Despite reports of looting, fighters and local people say they have been doing their best to collect evidence and preserve the human remains. One local resident, Aleksandr Mytyshchenko, whose house lies close to the disaster scene, said that he and his wife had initially thought that the downed plane was swooping low to drop bombs on them. Then came the blast, which embedded pieces of plane into the walls of his house. Mytyshchenko pulled them out and dumped them next to the side of the road. &quot;The smell was just horrible. I couldn&apos;t bear it,&quot; he added. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine&apos;s national security and defence council, said rebels were now taking away all evidence of the disaster that had been gathered by emergency workers. &quot;They [emergency workers] are working under an armed threat,&quot; he said. On Saturday, the Ukrainian government accused the rebels of deliberately removing corpses from the site and destroying the evidence. &quot;Terrorists brought 38 bodies to the mortuary in Donetsk,&quot; the government statement read, adding that it was presumed that Russian experts would perform the autopsies there. &quot;The terrorists are seeking out heavy load trucks to carry the plane wreckage to Russia,&quot; the government added. Grumpy neither denied nor confirmed the claims that some bodies had been moved to Donetsk. &quot;Maybe they did it, maybe not,&quot; he said. &quot;I personally didn&apos;t do that.&quot; The national security and defence council said emergencies ministry staff had checked roughly seven square miles around the crash site. But the workers had not been free to conduct a normal investigation, it added. &quot;The fighters have let the emergencies ministry workers in there but are not allowing them to take anything from the area,&quot; Lysenko said. &quot;The fighters are taking away all that has been found.&quot; Meanwhile in the Netherlands, forensic teams have begun collecting material, including DNA samples from relatives, photographs of victims and details of any distinguishing features, to help them identify the remains. Malaysia Airlines said 193 of the 298 passengers and crew killed in Thursday&apos;s aviation disaster were Dutch, 43 were Malaysian, 27 from Australia, 12 from Indonesia, 10 from the UK, four each from Germany and Belgium, three from the Philippines, and one each from Canada and New Zealand. The airline said it was assessing the security situation in Ukraine before taking any decision about flying next of kin to the country. A spokesman said that family members were being cared for in Amsterdam, while a team from Malaysia Airlines, including security officials, has flown to\u00a0Ukraine. What we know so far Social media  A posting on an account linked to a pro-Russia separatist leader in Ukraine, on a Russian social network site, claims that militants shot down at least one Ukrainian military plane near the Donetsk region town of Torez. The post has been deleted. Photographs  Ukrainian government adviser Anton Herashchenko claims the plane was hit by a missile fired by a Buk SA-11 launcher, a Russian-made, surface-to-air missile system. Photographs of such a launcher in the town of Snezhne, near the crash site, appear on the internet. Later, photographs of a Buk being moved on a transporter from Ukraine to Russia appear. The intercepts  Ukrainian authorities release a recording they claim is a conversation between pro-Russia militants admitting to shooting down the plane. A rebel fighter going by the nom de guerre of &quot;Major&quot; is heard telling another comrade called &quot;Grek&quot; that a group of fighters had brought the airliner down. &quot;The plane broke up in the air, near the Petropavlovskaya mines. The first [casualty] has been found. It was a woman. A civilian,&quot; he says. At 5.42pm, &quot;Major&quot; acknowledges the plane was civilian: &quot;Hell. It&apos;s almost 100% certain that it&apos;s a civilian plane.&quot; In another recording, a Russian officer called Igor Bezler is apparently heard reporting on the downing of the jet to his superior in Russian military intelligence, Colonel Vasily Geranin: &quot;A plane has just been shot down \u2026 They&apos;ve gone to search and photograph the plane. It is smoking.&quot; In a third conversation, a rebel fighter says: &quot;It turned out to be a passenger plane. It fell in Hrabove area. There&apos;s a sea of women and children \u2026&quot; Satellite detection  Satellite images show a plume of smoke left by a ground-to-air missile that brought down Malaysia Airlines flight 17. The images help to compile an intelligence analysis shared with the UN security council by the US ambassador Samantha Power, which she claimed showed the airliner was &quot;likely downed by a surface-to-air missile, an SA-11, operated from a separatist-held location in eastern Ukraine&quot;. The location of the missile launch appears crucial. &quot;It strains credulity to think [the missile] could be used by separatists without at least some measure of Russian support and technical assistance,&quot; said Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby.", "sentences": ["A spokesman said that family members were being cared for in Amsterdam, while a team from Malaysia Airlines, including security officials, has flown to\u00a0Ukraine."], "title": "MH17: armed rebels fuel chaos as rotting corpses pile up on the roadside", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/19/mh17-armed-rebels-chaos-corpses-ukraine", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Ukraine", "Russia", "Netherlands", "Air transport", "Plane crashes", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-19T19:16:47Z", "article": "Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was guided off its most recently used course as its pilots hoped to avoid thunderstorms brewing in the south of Ukraine, it has been claimed. When it was shot down, the doomed jet was many miles north of the flight paths it had used on previous days to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport. Nico Voorbach, a pilot who flew the same journey earlier this summer for KLM, and who is president of the European Cockpit Association, said poor weather might have been the reason why flight MH17 found itself in the sights of a surface-to-air missile launcher. The aircraft was shot down in the separatist Donetsk region of east Ukraine. Voorbach said: &quot;I heard that they were diverting from some showers. I think there were thunderclouds. You would ask air traffic control to divert left or right, and they would give you the permission.&quot; It also emerged that flight MH17 had initially filed a flight plan requesting to fly at 35,000ft above Ukrainian territory. On entering Ukrainian airspace, however, the plane&apos;s pilots were instructed to fly at 33,000ft by the local air traffic control due to other traffic. Malaysia Airlines said the pilots had to follow the lead of the local authorities. Malaysia&apos;s transport minister, Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai, told a press conference: &quot;MH17&apos;s flight path was a busy major airway, like a highway in the sky. It followed a route which was set out by the international aviation authorities, approved by Eurocontrol, and used by hundreds of other aircraft. &quot;MH17 flew at an altitude that was set and deemed safe by local air traffic control, and it never strayed into restricted airspace. The flight and its operators followed the rules. But on the ground, the rules of war were broken.&quot; In response to claims that weather led to MH17 changing its flight plan, Malaysia Airlines director of operations Izham Ismail said that it had no reports from the pilot to suggest that this was the case. The airline has been keen to stress that after the International Civil Aviation Organisation in April identified an area over the Crimea peninsula as risky, its aircraft had &quot;at no point&quot; flown into or requested to fly into the area. The tragedy has, however, raised questions over the wisdom of commercial airlines continuing to fly over conflict zones. Airlines currently take their cue on risk from national governments, who are responsible for the airspace over their territories, although states have an interest in keeping flight paths open because they are able to collect overflight fees. The UK Civil Aviation Authority recently urged UK-based airlines not to fly over a wide area near the Crimea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov, and several airlines, including British Airways, have followed that advice. Others, however, had been continuing to use the route, which is one of the &quot;aerial motorways&quot; between northern Europe and south Asia. Malaysia Airlines was one of more than a dozen that flew the route on Thursday. Its flight MH17 was only a few miles from an Air India Boeing 787 and a Singapore Airlines 777 when it was shot down. The only restriction placed on the route by the Ukrainian government was that aircraft must remain above 32,000ft. Voorbach said that the European Cockpit Association, which represents 38,000 pilots at the EU level, would discuss the possibility of more rigorous rules this week at its next board meeting. He added that there might now be an argument for a total ban on flying over conflict zones, but that the repercussions of such a change, including longer flight times and extra costs to airlines, could be huge for the aviation industry. He said: &quot;Do we stop planes flying over Israel, for example? Looking across the world, stopping flights over conflict zones would add a huge burden to the aviation industry. We need to see what the inquiry into the disaster discovers. I just hope that politics does not get in the way of the inquiry.&quot; Since the crash, all airspace in eastern Ukraine has been closed.", "sentences": ["When it was shot down, the doomed jet was many miles north of the flight paths it had used on previous days to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport."], "title": "Pilots' group president says MH17 shot down after attempt to avoid storms", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/19/mh17-changing-course-storms-pilot", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Ukraine", "Plane crashes", "Air transport", "World news", "Malaysia"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-19T23:03:00Z", "article": "The evidence is mounting. It suggests that pro-Russian separatists, using a sophisticated Buk missile, shot down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 on Thursday, as it flew above eastern Ukraine. The rebels had boasted of having acquired the anti-aircraft system. Earlier last week they used it to shoot down a Ukrainian military transport plane. They initially believed they had downed another &quot;fascist&quot; jet. Instead, they mistakenly hit a civilian passenger aircraft, on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, with 298 people on board. This was, as Barack Obama put it, &quot;an outrage of unspeakable proportions&quot;. The fields around the crash were scattered with wreckage and bodies. The victims were predominantly Dutch, Malaysian, and Australian, and from Indonesia, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, Canada and New Zealand. Ten Britons are among the dead; one American. Eighty children perished. Fifteen cabin crew. This was a multi-national catastrophe. It has profound consequences for the world&apos;s relations with Russia. Ukraine&apos;s president Petro Poroshenko has called the shooting down of MH17 a &quot;terrorist act&quot;. He blames pro-Moscow rebels. But the ultimate culprit, he says, is the Kremlin; the disaster a shocking wake-up call to a Europe reluctant to confront Vladimir Putin. The White House agrees with Kiev. Obama has not \u2013 yet \u2013 directly blamed Moscow. But he notes the context in which the disaster took place. Russia has fuelled the rebellion in eastern Ukraine. It has supplied weapons to the separatists. Its leaders, Russian citizens, report directly to Russia&apos;s spy agencies. Those who blew MH17 out of the sky need to be brought to justice. For this to happen there must be a full, credible and unimpeded investigation into the circumstances of the disaster. Russia needs to cooperate. It must allow access to international investigators, pressuring the rebels if necessary. The UN and the OSCE should play a leading role. OSCE representatives \u2013 the separatists have kidnapped them in the past \u2013 need to be given time to examine the evidence. And the plane&apos;s black boxes should be handed over to an international commission, not spirited away to Moscow. So far, though, it appears Russia&apos;s priority is to obstruct the investigation. Heavily armed rebels have given limited access to OSCE delegates who have been allowed to see only a small area of the crash site in Grabovo, next to the Russian border. Yesterday the rebels were reportedly, and unforgivably, blocking access while western intelligence experts say they are busy destroying evidence at the crash site. Others report that some of the rebels present at the site are drunk. If the shooting down of the aeroplane was wild, reckless and tragic then the behaviour of the rebels in the aftermath has been depraved. It is unspeakable that a head of state \u2013 in this case Putin \u2013 oversees such a catalogue of human grotesqueness and fails to call those responsible to account. Putin, however, operates in a different moral zone. The Russian president argues that Ukraine is responsible for the disaster since the Boeing was shot down over its territory. Meanwhile, the Russian media has been busy constructing its own counter-version of events.  State-controlled TV has reported that the Ukrainian army blew MH17 out of the sky, possibly believing it to be Putin&apos;s personal jet. It denies the rebels have surface-to-air missiles, despite video footage showing the truck-mounted system trundling through east Ukraine (and more recently heading back to Russia). The goal of these fictions is two-fold. One is to convince Russians their government is blameless. The other is to muddy the truth, and thereby weaken any international response. Russia under Putin has become a threat \u2013 regional and global. The Obama administration has treated Putin as a rational interlocutor. Washington believed that, with a little cajoling, he might be persuaded to play a role in solving diplomatic problems, such as Iran or Syria. This has not been the case. David Cameron wooed Putin, too. The PM watched the judo with him at the London 2012 Olympics, undermined the inquest into the death of Alexander Litvinenko, and invited Putin&apos;s friends to Tory dinners. In reality, Putin is a zero-sum thinker. He believes what is bad for the US is good for Russia. His view of the world is conspiratorial, and shaped by a long career in the KGB. When Ukrainians demonstrated against their corrupt president, Viktor Yanukovych, late last year Putin saw not a popular protest but a CIA plot. A pro-western government took over and Putin annexed Crimea. Then he unleashed an uprising in the east. In recent weeks the Ukrainian army has pushed back the rebels. In response, Putin has supplied them with tanks and \u2013 it seems \u2013 surface-to-air weapons to shoot down Ukrainian planes. Russia&apos;s behaviour should not go unchallenged. The US has led the way on imposing sanctions. The EU has been deeply reluctant to follow. It is worried about losing Russian gas (Germany, Italy) or Russian cash (the UK). If Russia continues to support the separatists the EU should impose visa bans and asset freezes on military and intelligence units known to be operating in eastern Ukraine. It should target the leadership of Russia&apos;s spy agencies \u2013 the FSB, SVR, and above all the GRU, Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency, which has been orchestrating the rebels&apos; activities. It should consider listing the Donetsk and Luhansk &quot;people&apos;s republics&quot; as terrorist groups. And banning oligarchs linked to the Kremlin, who are fond of London. We also need to offer Ukraine support. The country is virtually bankrupt; Yanukovych stole billions from his own treasury, merely the latest in a long line of venal Ukrainian politicians who have looted the state. This chronic theft has left it unable to defend itself from attack. The EU has to stop Ukraine&apos;s new government from doing the same. It should ban Ukrainian officials from owning assets in the west, or force them to prove their money is honestly obtained before they can buy anything, including Knightsbridge penthouses. The west might also ask Russia to make a financial contribution to UN HIV/Aids funds to make up for the death of scientists who were on their way to an Aids conference in Melbourne. And from Donetsk to Gaza, we need to change air traffic regulations so planes are not cruising within striking distance of a rocket. Over the past six months Vladimir Putin has redrawn the map of Europe, fuelled war in a neighbouring sovereign state, and waged a propaganda campaign, much of it directed at the west, and not seen since the cold war. The west has largely decided to leave well alone.

He died alongside his Dutch wife Estella and their children Friso and Jasper, who were 12 and 14 and of Dutch nationality.

Ben Pocock, from Keynsham, Bristol, was a second-year international business student at Loughborough University. &quot;He was a gifted academic and a talented athlete, but more importantly a warm, caring, fun-loving son and brother who had an extremely bright future ahead of him,&quot; his family said in a statement. John Alder, 63, a lifelong Newcastle United supporter, had barely missed a match in 50 years. His neighbour Margaret Bambra described him as &quot;a lovely guy, never bothering anyone. He was Newcastle-mad. I really cannot believe it \u2013 it&apos;s totally devastating. He did not deserve this.&quot; Alder died with a fellow Newcastle supporter, 28-year-old Liam Sweeney. By yesterday afternoon, Sunderland FC supporters, who had aimed to collect \u00a3100 to pay for a floral tribute to the pair, had amassed more than \u00a313,000 in 24 hours using social media.

His daughter, Natalia Gemmell, told Australian media her nephews and niece were &quot;gentle, clever beautiful kids&quot;. It also emerged that the step-grandmother of the Malaysian prime minister was one of the 43 Malaysians on board the plane. A family spokesman said Puan Sri Siti Amirah, the step-grandmother of Datuk Seri Najib Razak, was travelling alone on her way back to Jogjakarta, Indonesia, from Amsterdam. &quot;She was a very, very nice lady. A kindhearted, beautiful woman,&quot; the spokesman said. The crash heaped tragedy upon tragedy for one Australian family, who had also had relatives on the Malaysian Airlines plane lost in March. Kaylene Mann&apos;s brother, Rod Burrows, and sister-in-law, Mary Burrows, were on Flight 370, which is believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. On Friday, Mann learned that her stepdaughter, Maree Rizk, had been killed in Thursday&apos;s crash. &quot;It&apos;s just brought everyone, everything back,&quot; said Greg Burrows, Mann&apos;s brother. &quot;It&apos;s just ripped our guts again.&quot; Karlijn Keijzer, a 25-year-old graduate student at Indiana Universty, was one of 192 Dutch nationals known to have died. The Amsterdam student rowing club, Skoll, said on its website that Keijzer died with another rower, Laurens van der Graaff, on their way to a holiday. Dutch Aids activist Pim de Kuijer, once a political intern of former Dutch lawmaker Lousewies van der Laan, was also killed. On Twitter, van der Laan called him &quot;a brilliant, inspiring and caring activist fighting for equality and helping Aids victims around the world.&quot;", "sentences": ["A family spokesman said Puan Sri Siti Amirah, the step-grandmother of Datuk Seri Najib Razak, was travelling alone on her way back to Jogjakarta, Indonesia, from Amsterdam.", "The Amsterdam student rowing club, Skoll, said on its website that Keijzer died with another rower, Laurens van der Graaff, on their way to a holiday."], "title": "Family and friends pay tribute as last of the British dead in MH17 are named", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/20/malaysian-mh17-last-british-victims-named", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Netherlands", "UK news", "World news", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "Ukraine", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-19T23:48:34Z", "article": "Malaysia Airlines flight stewardess Angeline Premila Rajandran, 30, loved flying and travelling so much that she joined the company at 20 and never looked back. &quot;It was her first and only job,&quot; said Murphy Govind, 29, of his older sister, who was working as a flight attendant on the Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur MH17 flight when it was shot down over the Ukraine-Russian border early Friday morning. &quot;She loved travelling and loved what she was doing.

The death of the three children and their grandfather, who were heading home after a holiday in Europe, is just one of the heart-wrenching stories to come out of the crash that claimed 298 lives when a surface-to-air missile hit the plane. The four were among seven West Australians who were killed. The children\u2019s parents, Rin Norris and Anthony Maslin, who live in Scarborough, had stayed behind in Amsterdam for a few days. Gemell told the West Australian newspaper she cried with disbelief when told about the tragedy. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying, absolutely terrifying, and it doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d she said. The children\u2019s other aunt and Norris\u2019s daughter, Kirstin Norris,27, said she it was a \u201chorrible, horrible, horrible, situation\u201d. \u201cI broke the news to [the children&apos;s parents] them and I could hear the crying in the background,\u201d she told the ABC. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to talk to anyone still.

Red HIV ribbons adorned the doors of buildings throughout the precinct and people wore them on their shirts, symbols of the conference taking place but also a sign of remembrance for the six researchers and advocates bound for the conference who were killed on Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. The International Aids Society confirmed on Saturday night the names of those killed when their plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine: the former society president and professor of medicine, Joep Lange; his partner and Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development public health official, Jacqueline van Tongeren; Aids lobbyists, Pim de Kuijer and Martine de Schutter; director of support at the Female Health Company, Lucie van Mens; and World Health Organisation media coordinator, Glenn Thomas. A number of high profile HIV researchers, including conference co-chair and infectious diseases physician, Professor Sharon Lewin, will pay their respects at the opening ceremony on Sunday night to those killed. There will be one minute\u2019s silence. As delegates arrived, Lewin said all those killed were due to play a key role in the conference, whether through presenting research or sharing their stories. \u201cThose on MH17 all worked so hard in the science and community response to HIV \u2013 losing all six of them is a major loss,\u201d Lewin said. Lange, the scientific director of the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, was much beloved by the HIV research community in Australia. He had worked closely with the Kirby Institute for infection and immunity at the University of NSW. \u201cLange\u2019s greatest vision was how to get antiretroviral therapy to low-income countries,\u201d Lewin said. \u201cIn 2000, we thought that was impossible, and by 2013 we have 13 million people with HIV on treatment,\u201d Lewin said. \u201cIt was through Lange\u2019s vision and determination, along with that of many others, that this became possible. \u201cLange would have spoken about how antiretrovirals are only part of the work in combating HIV, and how that alone is not enough, and he would have been talking about global health, tuberculosis co-infections, and planning new studies with other people present at the conference because this is where a lot of new work starts.\u201d When the opening ceremony begins, the International Aids Society president, Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, will dedicate the conference to those who were killed. And the Dutch ambassador for HIV/Aids, Lambert Grijns, will read a letter out on behalf of the Netherlands in tribute. Director of the Dutch HIV support organisation Aids Fonds, Ton Coenen, was emotional as he spoke to Guardian Australia and described his colleagues, de Schutter and de Kuijer, as \u201cbeloved\u201d. \u201cOur colleagues were inspiring and beautiful people who we will forever embrace in our hearts,\u201d Coenen said. \u201cWe are saddened not just by the loss of colleagues but by all of those killed. Lucie [van Mens] worked on the development of the female condom, highly crucial because that doesn\u2019t get much attention. And Lange \u2026 what can I say? He was crucial to combating HIV. \u201cThere is a big gap left behind, but we are here because they would have wanted us to go on and keep up this fight.\u201d Coenen said his peers at the conference were devastated and the mood so far had been sombre. \u201cEveryone is devastated, of course, and it\u2019s not just an accident \u2013 it\u2019s a direct killing, it\u2019s murder, which makes it even more gruesome,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of these people killed had international networks, so it\u2019s not just our grief, it\u2019s also their grief.\u201d Coenen said he hoped the conference would help him to grieve and share the work of his peers. \u201cThere was a special moment at the pre-conference yesterday morning where 500 people in the room held a minute\u2019s silence led by UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidib\u00e9, who remembered each of those killed individually. \u201cThat was beautiful, and so important to us in grieving.\u201d A friend and colleague of Thomas\u2019s at the WHO, Chris Bailey, was not at the conference but said he was devastated by the loss. \u201cHe was such a dedicated professional, and was particularly interested in HIV, tuberculosis and other diseases affecting the developing world,\u201d Bailey said by phone. \u201cFor him, it was more than a job \u2013 it was an honour to be working with some of the most vulnerable parts of society.\u201d Thomas had been living with his boyfriend of many years, who Bailey said was \u201cabsolutely devastated right now\u201d. A candlelight vigil to be held in the city\u2019s Federation Square on Tuesday evening will take on a new meaning, serving as a remembrance for those on MH17, as well as a welcoming for conference guests and an acknowledgment to those living with and who have died as a result of HIV and AIDS.

She was one of several high-profile delegates to deliver powerful speeches in tribute to the six conference-bound researchers and advocates killed when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Delegates from the organisations representing those killed gathered behind her on stage as silence filled the room of 12,000 people attending the opening ceremony.

All were killed when MH17 was shot down.

A French virologist who won a Nobel prize for her fundamental work in discovering HIV, Barre-Sinoussi told conference delegates that she wished the conference were opening in happier circumstances. &quot;The extent of the loss of our colleagues and friends is still hard for me to comprehend or express,&quot; she said. &quot;We grieve alongside all of those throughout the world who have lost friends and family in this senseless tragedy. But we strongly believe that all of us being here for the next week to discuss to debate, and to learn is indeed what our colleagues who are no longer with us would have wanted. We dedicate Aids 2014 to them.&quot; A letter of support and condolence to the friends, families and colleagues of those killed on board MH17 was read out by the Dutch ambassador for sexual and reproductive health and HIV/Aids, Lambert Grijins. Condolence books circulated throughout the ceremony and will do so until the conference closes. Other tributes to those killed were paid by speakers throughout the ceremony, with many attendees wearing red remembrance ribbons on their shirts. The retired Australian high court judge Michael Kirby delivered the Jonathan Mann memorial lecture. Mann was a doctor who crusaded for human rights and Aids, who died with his wife and a plane full of passengers off St John&apos;s, Newfoundland, in 1998. &quot;He too was on his way to a conference on Aids,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;He too had precious gifts to impart. It was a terrible loss to us and to the world. His memory drives us on.&quot; &quot;When I was asked to give this opening plenary weeks ago I little thought that the plane crash that caused those deaths would be multiplied and magnified, this time by deliberate conduct of human beings. &quot;That it would kill delegates to our conference, and many other peaceful travellers, going about their lives with no harm in their hearts to others. &quot;How cruel and self-centred these murders appear to be. How reckless and outrageous to make such means available to zealots. How much more pain do we have to face in the world of Aids before we are through this bleak experience.&quot; Kirby said there was no doubt that irrational cruelty would remain a companion on the journey to fight HIV and Aids and its stigma. &quot;It requires us to remember the past president of the International Aids Society, Joep Lange and his wife. &quot;To think of all the other delegates who expected to be sitting here with us in this hall at this occasion. They devoted themselves to scientific research, to patient care, to law reform and human rights. Would that we could turn the clock back. Would that we could laugh, and think, and dream, and struggle shoulder to shoulder with them here tonight. Yet we cannot.&quot; The local co-chair of the Aids 2014 symposium, Sharon Lewin, said she was speaking in &quot;great sadness and shock&quot;. &quot;I was a friend and great admirer of both Joep Lange and Jaqueline van Tongeren and know they would want us all to continue the great work they were both so passionate about \u2013 seeing an end to HIV,&quot; she said.

Analysis of videos and photos posted on social media sites on the day the plane was brought down show a mobile Buk anti-aircraft missile launcher in the town of Torez, about six miles south of the farmland where the wreckage is scattered, and then in Snizhne, two miles east of Torez. Washington said that one of its satellites had detected a missile launch from the vicinity of those towns at the time the Boeing 777 was brought down. Eliot Higgins, a video and photographic analyst, published the pictures on his investigative journalism website Bellingcat. &quot;The guy who uploaded one of the videos, deleted the video and his accounts a few hours after the plane came down,&quot; Higgins said. &quot;There is a cluster of two videos and two photos we have analysed that show a Buk missile-launcher in Torez, at about midday from the angle of the sun, and then about an hour and half later in Snizhne.&quot; Higgins said that the pictures were not clear enough to be sure whether the mobile launcher in Snizhne was the same as the one in Torez.     Ukraine Missile Site WEB210714    The Ukrainian interior ministry also released a short video that appeared to show a Buk launcher with at least one missile missing being transported along a road on a trailer, claiming the weapon was being driven across the border into Russia. The video analysis confirms an earlier Associated Press report that one of its journalists spotted a Buk-like launcher in an area of eastern Ukrainian controlled by separatists, contradicting claims by rebel leaders not to have such missiles. The Buk, known to the US military as an SA-11 Gadfly, can reach targets up to altitudes of 46,000 feet. MH17 was flying at 33,000 feet en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Both the Ukrainian and Russian armed forces possess the launchers, which work alongside a separate mobile radar and a command vehicle. Experts say its target-acquisition technology is good enough to spot aircraft, but not to differentiate between civilian and military planes. The US state department on Sunday published its most detailed version of the attack on the Malaysian airliner. &quot;At the time that flight MH17 dropped out of contact, we detected a surface-to-air missile launch from a separatist-controlled area in southeastern Ukraine. &quot;We believe this missile was an SA-11,&quot; a statement from the US embassy in Kiev said, adding that the launch was in the area of Torez and Snizhne. &quot;Intercepts of separatist communications posted on YouTube by the Ukrainian government indicate the separatists were in possession of a SA-11 system as early as Monday July 14th. In the intercepts, the separatists made repeated references to having and repositioning Buk (SA-11) systems.&quot; The embassy statement also said that US intelligence audio analysts believed the intercepts of rebel commanders discussing the shooting down of the plane were genuine. It claimed that over the weekend of 12-13 July Russia sent a convoy of military equipment with up to 150 vehicles, including tanks, armoured personnel carriers artillery, and multiple rocket launchers to the separatists. The statement also said Russia was training separatist fighters in south-west Russia, including on anti-aircraft systems. Vitaly Nayda, Ukraine&apos;s counterintelligence chief, said that Buk missile launchers were seen crossing into Russia from eastern Ukraine on Friday morning. A definitive investigation was still being prevented on Sunday by eastern separatist groups imposing access restrictions. The rebels were removing bodies and the Ukrainian government accused them of sanitising the scene of evidence. A team of six investigators from Britain&apos;s Air Accidents Investigation Branch was sent to Ukraine soon after the disaster to take part in an international enquiry, but a spokeswoman from the AAIB said: &quot;They are still in Kiev, while the format for an investigation is being established.&quot; She declined to go into further detail but it is believed that the investigators have not gone to the crash site, east of Donetsk, for lack of security assurances. Senior figures in the air accident investigation community have said that the crash site is becoming increasingly contaminated, hindering the chances of a full independent inquiry. Phil Giles, formerly with the AAIB, said: &quot;It&apos;s absolutely crucial to seal of any crash site because it&apos;s similar to the scene of a crime and you don&apos;t want any contamination. The reason the site needs not to be disturbed is because if you accidentally shot down a Malaysian Airlines plane, the first you would do is find the record casing [from the aircraft] and disappear it.&quot;", "sentences": ["MH17 was flying at 33,000 feet en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur."], "title": "MH17: missile launcher was in towns near crash site, videos suggest", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/20/malaysia-airlines-mh17-videos-missile-launcher-torez-snizhne", "tags": ["Russia", "World news", "Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "US news", "Ukraine"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-20T19:19:30Z", "article": "The crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 has cast a web of grief around the globe, as communities from the Netherlands to Australia struggle to come to terms with the losses in their midsts. Many of the victims&apos; stories, such as that of the Van den Hende family, speak of the globalised nature of family in the 21st century. The Melbourne-based family of five, travelling on Dutch and Malaysian passports, had been returning from a holiday visit to Hans van den Hende&apos;s family in the Netherlands when disaster struck over eastern Ukraine. Having met at university in England, Van den Hende, 45, his Kuala Lumpur-born wife Shaliza Dewa, 45, and their children Piers, 15, Marnix, 12, and Margaux, eight, had moved to Australia for work seven years ago. On Sunday, the children&apos;s schoolmates laid down bouquets, cards and drawings at Bacchus Marsh grammar school in Melbourne, while relatives grieved in Europe and Asia. In the Netherlands, where most of the victims had lived, prayers were said on Sunday at church services around the country. The chairman of the Dutch bishops&apos; conference, Cardinal Wim Eijk, called on churchgoers to &quot;pray for strength and courage for the relatives&quot;. Since Thursday, the number of Dutch citizens among the 298 victims has risen to 192. King Willem-Alexander and his wife, Maxima, expressed their sadness in a condolence book opened by the government: &quot;Many thousands of people in our country and elsewhere are mourning the loss of relatives, friends, colleagues, classmates and acquaintances. We are with them in our thoughts. We feel with all those affected.&quot; As concerns rose about treatment of the bodies of the victims, the relative calm and composure that had still dominated in the Netherlands on Friday threatened to tip over into anger and frustration. &quot;Enough is enough&quot; ran the headline on the front page of bestselling Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, calling for a deployment of Nato troops in eastern Ukraine. &quot;Special forces should be used to trace the perpetrators of this massacre and transfer them to the Netherlands for trial,&quot; the paper said. &quot;It is now time for action.&quot;     People pray during a special mass in Saint Vitus church in Hilversum, Netherlands, for three families from the area who were killed in the crash. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images    A former assistant coach of the Dutch national team, John van &apos;t Schip, called for a boycott of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Commenting on reports that separatist militia were refusing emergency helpers access to the crash site, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, said: &quot;This is totally disgusting. It is also serious because it undermines the investigation.&quot; Rutte said he had told Russian president Vladimir Putin in an &quot;extremely intense&quot; telephone conversation that &quot;time is running out to quickly show the world that he intends to help&quot;. &quot;He must take the responsibility now with the rebels and show the Netherlands and the world that he is doing what is expected of him.&quot; His anger was echoed in Malaysia, where there is despair at the failure to bury the deceased quickly, in accordance with Islamic custom. &quot;Pro-Russian terrorists have not handled #MH17 victims with dignity. Putin promised PM @NajibRazak he would help. He hasn&apos;t,&quot; Malaysia&apos;s youth and sport minister, Khairy Jamaluddin, tweeted on Sunday. Forty-three of the victims were Malaysian, and Malaysia Airlines has announced it is &quot;retiring&quot; the flight code 17 in honour of the victims.

Dutch victims included the influential Aids researcher Joep Lange, 59, and his partner Jacqueline van Tongeren, 64, a former Aids nurse and communication manager at the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, as well as the Aids activists Lucie Man, Martine de Schutter and Pim de Kuijer. All of them had been on their way to the international Aids conference in Melbourne. Jenny Loh and Shun Po Fan, hostess and head chef at Rotterdam&apos;s popular Asian Glories restaurant, also died in the crash, leaving a son. Willem Witteveen, a Labour senator and law professor at Tilburg University, was killed with his wife, Lidwien Heerkes, and their daughter, Marit Witteveen. Their son was not on the flight. Wayan Sujana, 24, was on his way home to Bali after a four-week tour of Europe. Outside Schiphol airport, from where the plane took off, a Dutch friend of Sujana&apos;s family on Friday laid down a bouquet and a card with the words, written in Dutch and Indonesian: &quot;Goodbye my friend. It is incomprehensible what has happened here.&quot; Because of holiday season, up to a quarter of the victims were children and teenagers. At Minkema College in the Dutch town of Woerden, pupils mourned the loss of siblings Robert-Jan and Frederique van Zijkveld \u2013 18 and 19 respectively \u2013 and their friend Robin Hemerijk. The three were on their way to Kuala Lumpur for a holiday after graduating from high school. A number of Australian children and teachers had been on the flight in order to return to Western Australia for the start of the school term. The Maslin siblings \u2013 Mo, 12, Evie, 10, and Otis, eight \u2013 with their grandfather Nick Morris, 68, all from Perth, had been on a two-week holiday to visit relatives in Amsterdam. Friends and family on Sunday released balloons in honour of the children at an emotional match by Scarborough Junior, the Australian football club for which Otis played. A Malaysian family of six had been looking forward to returning to their home country after three years living abroad, according to Malaysian media. Tambi Jiee, 49, had gained a transfer from his managerial post at an oil company in Kazakhstan and was taking his wife Ariza Ghalazee, 46, and their children Muhammad Afif, 19, Muhammad Afzal, 19, Marsha Azmeena, 15, and Muhammad Afruz,13, on a trip around Europe before returning to Malaysia. A number of the victims were students or young professionals heading out to or returning from their placements abroad.

Along with his partner, Jacqueline van Tongeren, and other delegates, he was flying from Amsterdam to the International Aids Conference in Melbourne, Australia. The event was organised by the International Aids Society, of which he was the president from 2002 to 2004. As a young doctor specialising in infectious diseases at the Academic Medical Centre of the University of Amsterdam in 1983, in the early days of the Aids epidemic, Joep led research on the clinical evolution of HIV infection as part of the now historic Amsterdam cohort studies on Aids. In seeking to understand the causal relationship be tween HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and Aids (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), he and his colleagues demonstrated that severe immunological abnormalities happened very early on after infection, that virus load and replication were instrumental in the pathogenesis of Aids, and that there are major infection reservoirs of HIV. His early work led to his 1987 PhD thesis on &quot;serological markers in HIV infection&quot;, showing among other findings that high levels of HIV core protein p24 are a key determinant of disease progression. Joep&apos;s main contribution to the field was the development of antiretroviral therapy. From the early 1990s he conducted numerous clinical trials on HIV treatment, often in collaboration with his many colleagues around the world. Studies were conducted through the International Antiviral Therapy Evaluation Centre, Amsterdam, and the Netherlands Australia Research Collaboration on HIV with his friends David Cooper and Praphan Phanuphak in Thailand. An illustration of his understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV infection and of antiviral therapy was his argument as early as in 1995 that only treatment with at least three antiretroviral drugs could provide lasting treatment for HIV infection without inducing drug resistance in the virus. In addition, he argued for the initiation of therapy early in the course of the infection. He was right before empirical evidence was available, and both concepts lie at the foundation of modern antiretroviral therapy. It is thanks to his groundbreaking research that the number of babies infected with HIV through transmission from their mother has significantly decreased. Joep was not only a scientist and clinician, but, as with so many early Aids researchers, also an activist. He felt that his responsibility did not stop with publishing a scientific paper and he would not rest until people in need were able to benefit from his research. He worked tirelessly on widening access to anti- retroviral therapy from the mid-90s, when death rates among people living with HIV in poorer countries were high because of a lack of treatment. This he did in different ways \u2013 not just as president of the International Aids Society, but as chief of clinical research and drug development at the World Health Organisation&apos;s global programme on Aids in Geneva (1992-95), as founder in 2001 of PharmAccess, which promotes affordable health care in Africa, and as scientific director of HIV(e)ducation, an online training system for HIV healthcare providers. He was concerned about the long-term availability of antiretrovirals at cheaper prices, and rising rates of HIV drug resistance in Africa as a result of poor patient management and lack of proper monitoring \u2013 two potential threats to the long-term impact of antiretroviral therapy. As the founder of the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, he brought together all the major Dutch players in the field. His interests had expanded to the financing of health care, particularly using the private sector through the Health Insurance Fund, an initiative of Dutch insurance companies and multinationals with operations in Africa, and to cardiovascular diseases in the continent. Born in Nieuwenhagen, in the southern province of Limburg, Joep studied medicine at the University of Amsterdam, and gained his MD in 1981. In 2006 he became professor of infectious diseases at the university. He had a heart of gold and a strong sense of humour, and could be quiet and reflective until stirred to action after making up his mind. His writing was sharp and elegant and he had the courage to swim against the tide of what he saw as petty political correctness obstructing progress, such as in his argument with some Aids activists about trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis \u2013 through a preventive pill that can work to keep HIV from establishing a permanent hold \u2013 in Asia and Africa. Joep, an agnostic, had a deep love and knowledge of culture, particularly Dutch, English and French literature, all of which he read in the original version. He and I shared a profound admiration for the great 20th-century Flemish writer Willem Elsschot. Now and then he would send me a book, with a note in Dutch: &quot;Enjoy. What a writer!&quot; He could also be an absent-minded professor, leaving manuscripts, notes, books, and even a pair of skis behind at my home or office. Jacqueline was an HIV nurse who went on to become head of communications at PharmAccess. Joep is survived by his son, Max, and four daughters, Anna, Maria, Martha and Ottla, from his marriage to Heleen. \u2022 Joep (Joseph Marie Albert) Lange, specialist in infectious diseases, born 25 September 1954; died 17 July 2014", "sentences": ["Along with his partner, Jacqueline van Tongeren, and other delegates, he was flying from Amsterdam to the International Aids Conference in Melbourne, Australia.", "As a young doctor specialising in infectious diseases at the Academic Medical Centre of the University of Amsterdam in 1983, in the early days of the Aids epidemic, Joep led research on the clinical evolution of HIV infection as part of the now historic Amsterdam cohort studies on Aids.", "Studies were conducted through the International Antiviral Therapy Evaluation Centre, Amsterdam, and the Netherlands Australia Research Collaboration on HIV with his friends David Cooper and Praphan Phanuphak in Thailand.", "As the founder of the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, he brought together all the major Dutch players in the field.", "Born in Nieuwenhagen, in the southern province of Limburg, Joep studied medicine at the University of Amsterdam, and gained his MD in 1981."], "title": "Joep Lange obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/21/joep-lange", "tags": ["Aids and HIV", "Netherlands", "Medical research", "People in science", "Science", "Europe", "Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Plane crashes", "Australia news", "Society"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-22T15:37:00Z", "article": "Foreign ministers from France, Germany and Italy have condemned antisemitic violence at protests against Israel&apos;s invasion of Gaza and pledged to do all they can to combat it.

Since the outbreak of the recent conflict between Israel and Palestine, some demonstrators in Germany have called for Jews to be gassed \u2013 a clear reference to the Nazi murder of millions of Jews during the Holocaust.

Interpol, the international police agency, said one of its teams had begun preliminary identification work on the remains, which will all be flown to the Netherlands this week for fuller identification. The train, which included three refrigerated wagons, had been loaded by rebels and local emergency workers at Torez station, near the crash site. The rebels said there were 282 bodies and 87 &quot;other fragments&quot; on board and that 16 bodies are yet to be found. However, on Tuesday night Dutch officials said only 200 bodies had arrived in Kharkiv. The train came to a halt in the grounds of a weapons factory shortly before midday on Tuesday/yesterday. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said he expected the first of the bodies to arrive in Eindhoven on Wednesday. He said that the identification of some bodies would be quick but warned grieving families of victims that the identification of some could take &quot;weeks or even months&quot;. Ukraine has given the Netherlands the lead role in investigating the cause of the crash. More than half of the 298 victims were Dutch citizens. Two black boxes from flight MH17 handed to Malaysian officials by rebels on Monday night will be examined by UK accident investigators, it was announced yesterday. British experts at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) will retrieve data from the flight recorders for analysis, following a request from the government of the Netherlands, David Cameron said on Twitter. A spokesman for the Department for Transport, of which the AAIB has been a part since 2002, said: &quot;They&apos;re confident that, depending on the level of damage, they will be able to retrieve the information within 24 hours \u2026&quot; Monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have been on the scene since the suspected shooting down of Flight MH17 but are there only to observe rather than to investigate. On Tuesday they were joined by a three-man Malaysian delegation, one from Malaysian Airlines and two from the country&apos;s civil aviation authority. The crash site has still not been cordoned off, and journalists and locals were free to roam the debris on the fifth day since the crash. OSCE spokesperson Michael Bociurkiw said that his team found more body parts at the site during the day. &quot;Today at the side of the road there were human remains in a small plastic bag that had not been picked up,&quot; he said. In response to accusations that the rebels had been trying to cover up evidence at the site, Bociurkiw said that while there was a &quot;marked change&quot; in parts of the crash site, there was no evidence of major tampering. The OSCE has taken thousands of photographs of the site in the past few days and will hand them over to investigators. &quot;Two days ago as we left the site we saw men with power saws hacking into the part of the fuselage where the cockpit is \u2026 but that could have been part of the effort to recover human remains.&quot; Bociurkiw said the Malaysians were happy with the access they had been given and said they &quot;have not seen any evidence of major parts [of the plane] missing&quot;. Western governments have criticised the lack of access to the site for investigators, and on Tuesday the White House demanded that international investigators be given &quot;immediate and full access&quot;, with spokesman Josh Earnest saying there was not enough cooperation. The rebels, however, dispute this, saying any international experts are welcome at the site, but few have arrived due to security fears. A spokesperson for the Dutch foreign ministry said the few Dutch experts who briefly visited the crash site on Monday had left due to security concerns, but that a delegation will go back to the site as soon as possible. Fierce fighting has continued to flare across eastern Ukraine. On Monday, as what are believed to be the final 20 bodies were transported from the crash site to the train station in Torez, Ukraine&apos;s president, Petro Poroshenko, ordered a ceasefire within a 40km (24 mile) radius around the area. However, the boom of artillery was again audible at the crash site on Tuesday. Fighting around Donetsk airport and railway station on Monday, just outside the ceasefire zone, reportedly killed three civilians and further complicated transportation arrangements, according to the rebels. Details of the negotiations between Malaysia and the separatist authorities in Donetsk that led to a handover of the black box flight recorders in the early hours of Tuesday morning also began to emerge during the day. Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the so-called Donetsk People&apos;s Republic, negotiated with a Malaysian delegation into the early hours of Tuesday morning. The result appeared to be a deal that secured the safe passage of the MH17 victims&apos; bodies out of the rebel-held territory, the handover of the black boxes, and unfettered access to the crash site for international investigators. But in return the Malaysians seemed to offer the rebels a semblance of legitimacy. Col Mohamad Sakri, part of the Malaysian delegation, thanked &quot;his excellency Mr Borodai&quot; for agreeing to the transfer. The Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, on Tuesday said &quot;there were risks involved&quot; in making the deal with the separatists, for which he had spoken by telephone to Borodai. &quot;We felt an obligation to explore all avenues to break the impasse, and secure the return of the remains and the black boxes. After meeting the families, I felt that we owed it to them to act,&quot; he said in a statement. Razak said the recorders would be held in Malaysian custody while an international investigation team was formalised. It later emerged that the Malaysians planned to hand the boxes to the Dutch, who will send them to Britain for expert analysis. The Ukrainians have released recordings that they say show separatists scrambling to find the black boxes and hand them to Moscow, which the rebels have said are faked. Razak confirmed that the boxes appeared to be in good condition.

It was October 1978 and I\u00a0was on my year abroad as part of my languages degree. I had been busking in Aix-en-Provence and was hitchhiking back to Nice, where I was teaching in a\u00a0secondary school. I got a lift with a Belgian lorry driver, a big guy, a chain-smoker, tattooed. He was listening to Belgian radio and the newsflash came on: Brel dead. They started playing his songs non-stop and the driver told me all about him. At one point, I looked over and realised he was crying. At the time, I didn&apos;t really know who Brel was. I was living in a tiny studio flat and didn&apos;t have TV or radio, still less a record player. There was a jukebox in the canteen where I used to eat, but the only song I remember putting on is \u00c7a Plane Pour Moi by this Belgian outfit called Plastic Bertrand. And I quite liked a cute female French pop singer called France Gall, too. I suspect Brel would spin in his grave if he heard me say that. I started to buy his records. I realised there are just so many songs \u2013 my greatest hits box set has almost 200, almost all of high quality, of varying styles. He was prolific, despite the fact that he had a short career: only 20-odd years on stage and dead from lung cancer at 50. After performing on the cabaret circuit in Brussels and struggling to make his way, he left for Paris in 1953. He worked his way up, writing songs for other people and performing his own material. He was always on the move \u2013 an adventurer in every sense. He retired from performing in 1967, and spent the last 10 years of his life in semi-retirement, buying a yacht and sailing it around with the last of many mistresses, Maddly Bamy. He&apos;s buried on one of the Marquesa islands in Polynesia, just across from the grave of Paul Gauguin. I&apos;ve got the collected works of Brel upstairs, all his lyrics \u2013 it&apos;s a big tome. When you read them, they&apos;re like poems, in the clarity of their ideas, the\u00a0way they&apos;re expressed, the wit and cynicism, the plays on words. They can\u00a0move you even without the music, although the music adds layer upon layer of emotion. Some of the songs are\u00a0overwhelmingly romantic; at other times, he&apos;s just messing about, experimenting with feelings and words. I\u00a0see\u00a0him above all as a poet who wrote music and could sing with phenomenal passion. You can find lots of film of him on YouTube \u2013 it&apos;s like he&apos;s living the song, totally possessed by it. He wasn&apos;t a good-looking bloke \u2013 odd teeth, a face that didn&apos;t quite work, but on stage he was mesmeric. The records are great, but you have to see him perform live to get a sense of what a genius he was. He didn&apos;t talk much when he was up\u00a0there and never did encores, but at\u00a0the last French concert he gave, at\u00a0Olympia in Paris, the audience wouldn&apos;t let him go. He finished the concert and went down to his dressing room, but they simply refused to leave. The venue manager had to plead with him to go back on, which eventually he\u00a0did, in his dressing gown. When I did the Australian version of Desert Islands Discs a few years back, I asked if I could have 10 Brel songs. They said no, so in the end I had to just\u00a0choose one. I went for Ne Me Quitte Pas (Don&apos;t Leave Me). It&apos;s so powerful: a man begging a woman to\u00a0stay with him despite everything that&apos;s happened. &quot;I will offer you pearls of rain from lands where rain never falls,&quot; he sings. You assume it&apos;s about his wife, but he actually wrote it for one of his mistresses. My favourites change all the time, though. Amsterdam is extraordinary, and there&apos;s another called Les Flamandes \u2013 a funny and rude song about the Flemish and their terrible dancing. La Valse \u00e0 Mille Temps and Au Printemps are works of art. Le Moribond is brilliant (Terry Jacks&apos; Seasons in the Sun is a dreadful adaptation). I&apos;ve been listening to Brel for years now; every time we go to France on holiday, I find myself in markets, scouting for stuff. When I was working in Number 10, I&apos;d listen to him while running to work, and I listen to him now when I&apos;m cycling, though I know I shouldn&apos;t. He&apos;s always there somewhere. He&apos;ll be\u00a0at my funeral, I&apos;m sure. Again the list keeps changing, but right now it&apos;s between On N&apos;oublie Rien and Quand On N&apos;a Que L&apos;amour. Maybe the latter \u2013 the title roughly translates as When\u00a0Love Is All We Have. Not a\u00a0bad message to go out on. Brel en bref Life: Born 8 April 1929; died 9 October 1978. Way in: Amsterdam, all that musicality and passion. For aficionados: L&apos;Oeuvre Int\u00e9grale, the book of all Brel&apos;s lyrics (1998). It&apos;s addictive.

The remains were left outdoors for two days, in sweltering heat and rain, but expert investigators should \u201cpretty reliably\u201d be able to collect DNA to identify the remains. \u201cOverall, my guess is that as far as DNA analysis and identification, they should have pretty good success,\u201d said Dr David Foran, director of the forensic biology laboratory at the University of Michigan. He said the key to DNA identification is selecting tissue that has the least amount of DNA degradation, such as deep muscle tissue in the torso. If that is not available, investigators will typically seek skeletal tissue or dental records.  DNA collected from the remains must be measured against known reference samples, such as toothbrushes in people\u2019s homes or hair, which MH17 forensic investigators have been collecting. If reference samples are not available, investigators can collect DNA samples from relatives, ideally parents or children who share half of each other\u2019s DNA. Although entire families were killed in the crash, DNA can also be collected from relatives.  \u201cWhen you start getting out to aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents, you actually want probably three or four or five people to be able to make a good statistical argument that you\u2019ve got a positive ID because you\u2019re going to be sharing less and less DNA,\u201d Foran said.  Body parts can be identified by a similar DNA process and also by characteristics such as scars, tattoos and wedding rings. Once investigators establish that a body part belongs to a certain person, investigators will then have a record of that person\u2019s DNA and be able to connect it with other remains. \u201cIt ends up being a kind of giant jigsaw puzzle of trying to place every body part based on its DNA or some other identifying characteristics,\u201d said Foran.  The identification of the victims will be an international effort, overseen by the Dutch authorities and Interpol. A four-strong Australian team of disaster victim identification experts left Melbourne for Amsterdam on Tuesday. Led by a forensic pathologist, David Ranson, the team includes two odontologists, who specialise in identifying victims from dental records, and a pathology technician, who removes organs and reconstructs torn and tattered bodies. The Australian team is based at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine. Established after the Bali bombings in 2002, the experts have identified people who died in Japan\u2019s tsunami, which killed more than 15,000 people in 2011, and the Black Saturday bushfires which tore through Victoria, killing 173. The experts generally work to a five-stage process: at the scene, in the mortuary, collection of ante-mortem data, reconciliation of the findings and, finally, a debrief. All this is handled by the pathologist \u2013 apart from ante-mortem data, which is gathered by police. Relatives are asked for information on past medical history, such as operations, and also samples for DNA identification. Professor Noel Woodford, director of the VIFM, told Guardian Australia that each disaster presented unique challenges in identifying the dead. \u201cI imagine the bodies in this disaster will be in various states of intactness; some will be severely traumatised,\u201d he said. \u201cFire is very destructive to bodies, of course, and there\u2019s also the trauma caused by the plane crash. \u201cThis one will be a bit different to some other cases because we have a passenger manifest, so we have a known population of people to identify, ignoring the possibility of people killed on the ground, of course.\u201d Woodford said the team would look for primary identification evidence, such as fingerprints, DNA and dental records. Secondary signs, such as tattoos or signs of previous surgery, will be used to back up this primary data. \u201cWe cast the net widely to start with because we don\u2019t know if someone\u2019s been to a dentist, for example,\u201d he said. \u201cDNA and fingerprints are very specific, apart from DNA in identical twins, of course. \u201cAt the time of the Black Saturday bushfires, we had to identify 60% of the people by dental means. Teeth are very resilient, but some intense fires can degrade them so you have to look for other things.\u201d The first stage of the pathologists\u2019 process has already faced complications because of the delay in securing the crash site and moving the bodies from eastern Ukraine to Amsterdam. \u201cProper examination of the scene is an important thing,\u201d said Woodford. \u201cYou can collect all kinds of information, such as tissue that has detached from bodies. In ideal circumstances you gather evidence at the scene, as it\u2019s all grist to the mill for identification. The delay means the fingerprints may not be quite as clear, but the teeth will still be intact. You can get DNA in most cases, too.\u201d While the experts who will help identify and repatriate the dead of flight MH17 are seasoned professionals, Woodford concedes there is always an emotional burden. \u201cThese people are used to dealing with death and sad situations, but that\u2019s not to say it won\u2019t take its toll,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s properly managed, people cope very well. The team approach helps, as there are lots of people around who are supportive. \u201cIt helps that you have the knowledge that you are doing something positive for the families. You know that any delay adds to their distress and you want them back with their loved ones as soon as possible.\u201d", "sentences": ["A four-strong Australian team of disaster victim identification experts left Melbourne for Amsterdam on Tuesday.", "Teeth are very resilient, but some intense fires can degrade them so you have to look for other things.\u201d The first stage of the pathologists\u2019 process has already faced complications because of the delay in securing the crash site and moving the bodies from eastern Ukraine to Amsterdam."], "title": "MH17: grim task ahead for DNA experts as they sift remains to identify bodies", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/23/mh17-grim-task-ahead-for-dna-experts-as-they-sift-remains-to-identify-bodies", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Forensic science", "Netherlands", "World news", "Australia news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-23T15:08:37Z", "article": "Wednesday.

Some of them feel like reviews of pain, with their journalists acting as thermometers, measuring the temperature of our grief. There was one story that at first I had to stop reading halfway through. The Guardian, concluded, Dutch travellers react calmly to loss of flight MH17 after talking to some people at the airport and speaking to students having a cigarette by a canal. The journalist in question went to the queue of passengers waiting to check into another Malaysia Airlines flight bound for Kuala Lumpur. Did he expect to find no queue? That every passenger, having booked tickets and accommodation months ago and taken holiday from work, would decide after the disaster to temporarily suspend their life? That this is how one mourns? Or ought to mourn? Another one. The Netherlands, a nation in mourning but mindful of ties to Russia, said a New York Times headline. As if anyone of us who is grieving, including officials and politicians, is seriously thinking about business and business implications right now. Or in The Straits Times, which described the stoic reaction of the Dutch, quoting the Malaysian ambassador to the Netherlands to explain this as the Dutch being \u201cvery dignified\u201d. These sort of articles add insult to injury by trying to explain where our reaction, or lack of it at first sight, comes from. As if somehow the extent of our mourning does not meet national stereotypes. Maybe it\u2019s because the Dutch are known to be upfront and even loudmouthed in normal situations. Perhaps there was an expectation of a public outpouring of emotion, pockets of collective grief and loud calls for retaliation. What is wrong with describing rather than reviewing our grief? If this was the case what would be found is that there has been rationalisation as we struggle to make sense of things, along with surprisingly moderate responses from government officials. Even after Dutch mayor Pieter Broertjes called for Putin\u2019s daughter Maria, who is said to live in Voorschoten, to be made to leave the country, he quickly apologised, saying his comments \u201cstemmed from a feeling of helplessness\u201d. This has less to do with our ties with Russia than the utmost priority: to get the bodies of victims out of a rebel-held area. The worst way to do this would have been by pointing fingers without any evidence. Indeed, we are not America. Those who have followed the social hashtag #MH17 and the speeches of Dutch politicians in response to the disaster, may have noticed the rollercoaster of emotions our nation is still experiencing. Shock and speechlessness making way for sadness and worry, soon replaced by abhorrence, confusion and rage. On Monday, our liberal prime minister declared that a day of national mourning wasn\u2019t \u201cwithin our tradition\u201d. But even he quickly realised that this tragedy transcends tradition. Today, as the first bodies of victims arrive in Eindhoven at around 4pm local time, the nation will hold a minute of silence. Later at Dam square in Amsterdam, there will be a silent march to commemorate the victims. Maybe that is it. The fact that we are mute will express the extent of our pain after this unspeakable crime.", "sentences": ["Later at Dam square in Amsterdam, there will be a silent march to commemorate the victims."], "title": "MH17: don\u2019t judge Dutch people\u2019s grief after this unspeakable crime | Laura Klompenhouwer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/23/mh17-dont-judge-dutch-people-193-compatriots-killed", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "World news", "Netherlands", "Europe", "Death and dying", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-23T19:53:24Z", "article": "As the first coffin was lowered from the planes on the runway, silence fell over Eindhoven military airport. The only sound came from a row of flags whipping in the wind at half mast. Almost a week after Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot from the skies above Ukraine, 40 bodies arrived on Wednesday in the Netherlands, the country that bore the heaviest toll in the crash. King Willem-Alexander, Queen Maxima and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, joined about 1,000 relatives and friends of the victims, who gathered at the airport for a ceremony receiving the two military transport planes. A lone trumpeter played the Last Post as troops in dress uniform saluted then carried the wooden caskets to a row of hearses. They drove from the airport under military police escort to an army barracks in the central city of Hilversum where forensic experts were waiting to begin the painstaking task of identifying the remains. Crowds gathered on bridges along the 65-mile route to throw flowers on to the convoy of 40 hearses. The Dutch government had declared a day of national mourning \u2013 the first since the death of Queen Wilhelmina in 1962 \u2013 and at 4.07pm a minute&apos;s silence was requested across the country. Two-hundred and ninety-eight passengers and crew were killed when the Boeing 777 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpar was shot down last Thursdaya week today. The Dutch victims numbered 193. In a nation of just 16 million, few have been unaffected by the disaster. &quot;Holland is a small country. Everyone knows someone who knows someone who died in the crash,&quot; said Peter, who was waiting at Schipol airport. &quot;It has completely changed how we look at the conflict in the Ukraine. Everybody talks about it: neighbours, colleagues, relatives.&quot; Some have inevitably described the biggest aviation disaster in Dutch history as &quot;Holland&apos;s 9/11&quot; \u2013 a misleading term, not least because the Dutch passengers on flight MH17 are not thought to have been targeted deliberately. And yet, relations between the Netherlands, home to the majority of the victims, and Russia, accused by some of aiding those who carried out the attack, have in recent days become increasingly fraught. At Schiphol airport, where on the day after the crash there was still a sense of business carrying on as usual, the mood was now different. The impromptu shrine outside terminal three, little more than a pile of flowers on Friday, had grown into a sea of bouquets, teddy bears and candles. A letter to one of the victims described him as a &quot;kind, gentle and funny person&quot;. The card read: &quot;Even in death he&apos;s still a better bloke than all of us.&quot; A woman named Miranda said she had come to the airport specially to lay down flowers. She used to live in Asia, she said, and had a lot of friends who regularly flew with Malaysia Airlines. Something in her attitude, and that of friends, towards Russa, had altered over the last week, she said. &quot;At first we were numb but now there are a lot of angry feelings coming up.&quot; In a widely shared article, the writer Bas Heijne criticised his government&apos;s &quot;overtly cautious, strangely muted&quot; response to the disaster. The Dutch, Heijne argued, had always defined themselves somewhere on a scale of pragmatism and moralising, &quot;the Dutch merchant and the Protestant preacher&quot;. In recent years the merchant had gained the upper hand; wagging the finger at countries like Russia, many politicians and businessmen warned, only damaged the economy. So the government had done little to defend itself when Vladimir Putin accused the Netherlands of &quot;promoting paedophilia&quot; or when Dutch Greenpeace activists were arrested for getting too close to a Russian oil platform. &quot;For too long,&quot; Heijne wrote, &quot;the Dutch government has coddled the dictator in Moscow.&quot; Other commentators accused Dutch leaders of letting commercial interests get in the way of diplomatic consequences. Last year Russia exported goods and services worth $70bn to the Netherlands. If one country could seriously hurt Putin with trade sanctions, said one analyst in the German newspaper Die Welt, it was the Netherlands. Frustration with the delayed return of the air crash victims&apos; bodies, and reports in the Dutch media that the crash site had been looted, have affected the country&apos;s mood. Where at first there had been calm and composure, there were now also flashes of anger. Hans de Borst, whose 17-year-old daughter, Elsemiek, died in the crash, wrote an open letter to Putin and pro-Russia separatists, which he put on Facebook: &quot;Aforementioned misters, I hope you&apos;re proud to have shot her, amongst other, young life and future. And that you will be able to look at yourself in the mirror tomorrow morning.&quot; Politicians have adjusted their rhetoric accordingly. &quot;All of the Netherlands feels their anger,&quot; said Rutte on Sunday, after meeting relatives. &quot;All of the Netherlands feels their deep grief. All of the Netherlands is standing with the next of kin.&quot; Frans Timmermans, the foreign minister, previously hesitant about calling for sanctions, adopted a notably firmer stance at a meeting of ministers in Brussels on Monday: &quot;There is no Dutch blockade of further sanctions. The Netherlands wants the European Union [to make] a united, and also strong, clear, statement against the unrest in eastern Ukraine.&quot; As if to symbolically underline Holland&apos;s newfound resolve, the row of flags at Eindhoven airport included a Ukrainian, but no Russian, flag, even though there were no Ukrainian nationals among the victims. At Schiphol, the Hoogewoud family had stopped off to leave flowers after seeing off their youngest daughter, who was flying to Thailand. Marloek, the older daughter, said a Spanish friend had sent her a Facebook message after the crash expressing hope that the Dutch government would press charges against the pro-Russian separatists. &quot;But that&apos;s not people&apos;s first reaction here.&quot; Her father, Ferdinand Hoogewoud, said: &quot;How can we expect politicians in Russia or the Ukraine to take responsibility after two days, when it took the Netherlands two decades to own up to its role in Srebrenica?&quot; Only a day before the MH17 crash a Dutch court had ruled that the government was liable for the deaths of about 300 victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia. &quot;The crisis in the Ukraine used to feel very far away,&quot; observed Hoogewoud. &quot;Now it&apos;s our problem too. We can&apos;t push it away.&quot;", "sentences": ["Two-hundred and ninety-eight passengers and crew were killed when the Boeing 777 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpar was shot down last Thursdaya week today."], "title": "Netherlands mourns as bodies of MH17 plane crash victims are flown home", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/23/netherlands-mourns-mh17-plane-crash-victims-flown-home", "tags": ["Netherlands", "Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Ukraine", "Russia", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-24T12:29:39Z", "article": "News that Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down in Ukraine sent shock waves around the world. The cracks in an already fragile political landscape began to widen and the senseless loss of innocent life united the world in horror and grief. When it was announced that a group of high-profile Aids researchers travelling to attend an international conference in Melbourne were among the dead, it quickly became clear the impact of this tragedy would be felt far beyond the troubled borders of eastern Europe. Missing from the delegates at the Aids 2014 symposium was the former International Aids Society president and professor of medicine Joep Lange. As a young doctor in the 1980s, in the early days of the Aids epidemic, Lange led research on the clinical evolution of HIV infection and in the 90s was instrumental in the development of antiretroviral therapy. His ambitions, however, were not limited to furthering scientific knowledge. He made it his mission to widen access to the drugs in developing countries and his loss is likely to be felt most keenly among development workers and activists fighting to improve HIV/Aids care in the world&apos;s poorest communities. Dr Michael Merson, a longtime friend and colleague of Lange, describes the work he was undertaking in east Africa and Thailand as &quot;critical&quot;. The founding director of the US-based Duke Global Health Institute says Lange didn&apos;t understand why these drugs had to cost so much, particularly for poorer populations: &quot;If you go back to the mid-90s when the antiretroviral drugs first became available, the cost was about $15,000 (\u00a38,800) a year for a patient. Now it is $100 a year. Lange was not the only one who did this, but he was out in front, saying that if we can get Coca-Cola out there why can&apos;t we get Aids drugs to the people who need it?&quot; Merson first met the medical pioneer, who founded the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, in the 1990s while directing the World Health Organisation&apos;s global Aids programme. He hired Lange to lead the unit on clinical research, but after both left WHO they remained friends and continued to collaborate on global health programmes. Merson mourns losing such an &quot;exceptional&quot; individual. He explains how a lot of people got into the field in the early 80s and bonded during those difficult years when there was no treatment and a lot of discrimination. Lange emerged from those harrowing years as a strong, inspirational leader. Whether you were an activist, scientist, physician, government bureaucrat or working in an NGO, Merson insists you wanted Lange on your side. Lange&apos;s partner and colleague at the institute, Jacqueline van Tongeren, 64, also lost her life in the crash, as well as the director of support at the Female Health Company, Lucie van Mens, and the WHO media coordinator Glenn Thomas who was 49. Martine de Schutter was another victim of the disaster. For the last year, she has been leading a programme called Bridging the Gap, aimed at providing vital drugs to marginalised groups most vulnerable to HIV/Aids across Africa, Asia and Latin America. According to the executive director of the International HIV/Aids Alliance, Alvaro Bermejo, she was making significant progress in identifying ways to break down the barriers for these groups to access crucial health services. He describes her loss as &quot;a void which is difficult to fill&quot;, and her death is a particular blow to development workers in that field. Bermejo also worked with and speaks of the loss of Pim de Kuijer. The 32-year-old Dutchman was working as an HIV lobbyist, trying to convince the Dutch government to allocate more money to finance Aids programmes in regions where it will make the biggest difference. Bermejo, who knew both de Schutter and De Kuijer well from sharing the same offices in Brussels, Geneva and Washington, claims his knowledge of the Dutch parliament was incredibly detailed and believes it will be difficult to replace him. The Aids movement, however, is sadly used to losing leaders. Some have died as a result of the virus itself, while others have met a similar tragic fate to those travelling on MH17. In 1998, Jonathan Mann, former director of the WHO&apos;s international Aids programme, died when a Swissair flight from Geneva to New York came down over Nova Scotia. Replacing leaders, Bermejo says, is something that the Aids movement has had to do more than any other. Despite the grief and disbelief one of the major strengths of the Aids community is the spirit of collaboration. It is the ability to work together on a global scale that Bermejo hopes will push the movement forwards after this tragedy. He says: &quot;Pim and Martine were really great examples, not just of researchers and implementers, but of how the power of alliances and collaboration can take you beyond what one organisation can do. &quot;That has to be part of their legacy \u2013 that commitment to continue working in partnerships across organisations to bring about the end of the Aids epidemic.&quot; Read more stories like this:  \u2022 Sana&apos;a, Yemen: delivering Aids medicine in a city under siege \u2022 Preventing HIV: the latest on vaccine development and gene therapy \u2022 Wanted: a standard model of HIV and Aids diagnostics for Africa Join the community of global development professionals and experts.

Urban physics An engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has introduced &quot;urban physics&quot; by analysing city layouts as molecular structures. Boston and LA are understood as disordered \u201cliquids\u201d, the grid-like Chicago is \u201cglass\u201d and New York City a \u201chighly ordered crystal\u201d. The professor argues that urban physics gives planners a new way to understand a city\u2019s complexity and its resilience to climate change \u2013 though it sounds to us rather more like urban chemistry.

Pro-Russia separatists in the area, who are accused of bringing down the plane using a surface-to-air missile, have said they would welcome international investigators but the presence of foreign forces in the volatile region presents challenges, with military confrontation between Ukraine&apos;s forces and rebels rumbling on in the immediate vicinity. Of the dead, 193 were Dutch citizens and 28 were Australians. Many of the bodies were removed from the site by local emergency workers and transferred by train to Kharkiv, from where they are being flown in batches to the Netherlands. But observers say there are still human remains at the site and part of the task of the 40 Dutch police who are due to arrive will be to ensure that all the bodies and body parts are found. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said on Friday that the contingent would be unarmed. &quot;If we go with a big military presence, the situation could become more unstable than stable,&quot; he said. The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, said his country was also ready to send police and had officers standing by in Europe, ready to travel to the site if agreement is achieved. &quot;This will be a police-led humanitarian mission,&quot; the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said in Kharkiv, where she has been overseeing the arrival and onward flights to the Netherlands for the remains. &quot;And there will be body identification and forensic experts. And of course we will ensure they are safe, that they will have protection.&quot; In the week since MH17 came crashing to the ground the site has remained unsecured, with open access to media and locals. So far, the only international monitors at the site have been observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), joined by a handful of international investigators. There has been anger at allegations of looting as well as suggestions that some of the rebels could be attempting to cover up potential evidence. Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the OSCE, said observers had found identity cards and credit cards at the site on Friday and added that people were seen moving parts of the fuselage. A rebel fighter who arrived at the scene soon after the crash told the Guardian on Friday that he and his men had found locals looting items from the site and taking pieces of fuselage to sell as scrap metal. The question of looting was again raised on Friday after a local woman apparently posted photographs on Instagram of herself wearing makeup apparently taken from the site. The photograph was geolocated to the town of Torez, near the crash site, and the caption was: &quot;Mascara from Amsterdam, well, from the field if you know what I mean.&quot; The Instagram account was later deleted after the woman received hundreds of angry messages. One user who initially &quot;liked&quot; the Instagram photograph confirmed to the Guardian that the account was real, but claimed the mascara was not stolen from the wreckage of MH17. The most problematic element of the Dutch and Australian missions will be security. Although both Ukrainian forces and the rebels have promised to observe a ceasefire in the immediate area around the crash site, fighting close to the regional capital, Donetsk, has intensified in recent days, with heavy shelling audible even in the centre of Donetsk in the early hours of Friday morning. The president, Petro Poroshenko, is keen to end the insurgency in the east of the country before Ukraine&apos;s independence day on 24 August, but serious fighting will be required to dislodge the rebels from Donetsk, with inevitable civilian casualties. Human Rights Watch said Grad rocket attacks had killed 16 people in Donetsk in recent days, in what &quot;may constitute war crimes&quot;. The organisation said the evidence pointed to Ukrainian forces being responsible, despite denials in Kiev. Both Russia and Ukraine are accusing the other of shelling across the border. Ukraine says Russia has carried out nightly shelling into its territory in recent days, and also accuses the Russians of shooting down Ukrainian planes from inside Russia. In turn, Russia claimed the Ukrainians fired mortar rounds into Russia on Friday. A statement from Russia&apos;s investigative committee said: &quot;Those who shot from Ukraine carried out the shooting purposefully with an intent to kill Russian law enforcement officials. &quot;It was only the poor preparation of the Ukrainian military and the timely evacuation of law enforcement officers under the cover of armoured transport vehicles that did not allow the shooters to realise their intention.&quot; Also on Friday, the Pentagon said it believed Russia was planning to supply multiple launch rocket systems to the rebels in east Ukraine, indicating that satellite pictures showed the systems approaching the border and a transfer was expected &quot;in the very near future \u2026 potentially today&quot;.", "sentences": ["The photograph was geolocated to the town of Torez, near the crash site, and the caption was: &quot;Mascara from Amsterdam, well, from the field if you know what I mean.&quot; The Instagram account was later deleted after the woman received hundreds of angry messages."], "title": "MH17: Australia and Netherlands join renewed push to secure crash site", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/25/australia-netherlands-push-secure-mh17-crash-site", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Ukraine", "Plane crashes", "World news", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "Netherlands", "Europe"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-25T19:00:43Z", "article": "If you don\u2019t want your books to be controversial, it\u2019s probably better not to call them Mein Kampf. Karl Ove Knausgaard is Norwegian, not German, so what he actually called his autobiographical series was Min Kamp. It means, of course, \u201cmy struggle\u201d, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about: the struggle to grow up with an alcoholic father, the struggle to feel like a man in an equal-opportunities social democracy, the struggle at the hairdresser\u2019s to remember the true colour of your hair. Whatever else it is or isn\u2019t, it\u2019s hardly a master plan for the human race. Knausgaard\u2019s not-quite-misery memoir hasn\u2019t sold quite as well as Hitler\u2019s, but it\u2019s still doing pretty well. In Norway alone, the series of six books \u2013 published as \u201cfiction\u201d there, though everyone knows full well it\u2019s autobiographical \u2013 has sold more than 450,000 copies. And he\u2019s not just a homegrown hit. Outside of Norway he\u2019s become a massive bestseller. Zadie Smith said she needed the next volume \u201clike crack\u201d. Global success hasn\u2019t, it seems, made the \u201cstruggle\u201d easier. Half of Knausgaard\u2019s family won\u2019t speak to him. He has had so much hate mail he\u2019s moved to Sweden. And then there\u2019s the money. \u201cWe got money,\u201d he said in a newspaper interview this week, \u201cand it scared me \u2026 I said to [my wife], Linda, maybe we should give it away to Greenpeace or something, because it came from an unethical project \u2026 \u201cShe just looked at me,\u201d he added, \u201cand said no.\u201d As ethical dilemmas go, it certainly makes a change. Should whales benefit from the pain of your relatives? Should that money go towards the airfares of Greenpeace\u2019s international programme director, who commutes from Luxembourg to Amsterdam? But the question of what writers owe their families is as old as the squiggles on papyrus in Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb. We know what happens when it all goes wrong. Hanif Kureishi\u2019s sister made a big fuss about the way her brother portrayed his family in his work. Constance Briscoe\u2019s mother sued her over the claims she made in her memoir, Ugly. James Frey was publicly shamed by Oprah Winfrey when his memoir turned out to be A Million Little Fibs. One person\u2019s snapshot can be another\u2019s distorting mirror. But if you get it right, what happens then? Knausgaard\u2019s friends and family aren\u2019t upset because he got it wrong; ran upset because what he has written is embarrassing and exposing, and because they thought that what happened in their lives wasn\u2019t about to be shared with millions of people around the world. They thought there was a part of life that was private. They didn\u2019t realise that the personal details of their lives were simply more fuel for a writer\u2019s fire. Graham Greene knew quite a lot about this. He said that every writer needed to have a \u201cchip of ice in the heart\u201d, knowing that anyone close to a writer was running a risk. But he said this at a time when writers were people who earned money by writing, and who published books. Everyone wasn\u2019t churning out \u201ccontent\u201d about their lives, their friends, and their half-naked benders, in a digital universe that has no end. It\u2019s hard to know what Graham Greene would have made of people telling their Twitter \u201cfollowers\u201d that they\u2019re looking forward to seeing friends none of them have heard of. He didn\u2019t say all that much about narcissism, but he did say that \u201cif you have a soul, you can\u2019t be satisfied\u201d, which does make you think he didn\u2019t like people to sound smug. What mattered, for Greene, when it came to writing, wasn\u2019t the subject but the art. For art, you need a certain distance. You need, as Knausgaard says when describing a trip to the National Gallery, a \u201cdistance between reality and the portrayal of reality\u201d. In other words, a chip of ice. Knausgaard certainly has it. In a radio interview, he said he had sold his soul. The question is whether it was worth it. For him and his family, the answer may be no, but for millions of readers it will be yes. Perhaps, in the end, there\u2019s just one rule: if you\u2019re going to put your personal life in the public arena, and risk upsetting people you\u2019re meant to care about, you\u2019d better make pretty damn sure you do it well.

Catherine Ashton, the EU&apos;s foreign policy chief, agreed last week to requests from the Ukrainian authorities for urgent help in bolstering the country&apos;s security services. An initial \u00a32m is being provided by the EU to fund the unarmed advisers, but further money is expected to be committed as the conflict between the government and pro-Russian dissidents continues after the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The decision is likely to provoke an uncompromising response from the Kremlin, which on Saturday accused the EU of aiding terrorists through its most recent extension of sanctions. A Russian foreign ministry statement condemned sanctions imposed on Friday against 15 named people, including a former Russian prime minister, a former speaker of the Duma (parliament), senior intelligence officials, and leaders of the pro-Russia revolt in eastern Ukraine. It accused the EU of taking &quot;a complete turn away from joint work with Russia on international and regional security, including the fight against the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism [and] organised crime&quot;. The statement went on: &quot;We are sure the decisions will be greeted enthusiastically by international terrorists. What it wasn&apos;t able to do over decades \u2013 drive a wedge into the international community \u2013 they&apos;ve done with ease in Brussels. &quot;At the same time, the European Union has once and for all joined the side of Washington and Kiev&apos;s fairytales regarding ongoing events in Ukraine, depriving itself of an alternative and objective source of information. Do they understand in the capitals of the EU countries what these irresponsible steps could lead to, either in the political or economic spheres?&quot; Among new subjects of an EU-wide asset freeze and travel ban are Alexander Bortnikov, head of the Russian Federal Security Service, and Sergei Beseda, head of the FSB department that oversees international operations and intelligence activity. Four members of Russia&apos;s security council and 18 organisations or businesses, including rebel formations in Ukraine&apos;s east, were added to the trade bloc&apos;s sanctions list at the same time. The action brought to 87 the total number of people under EU sanctions since Russia&apos;s annexation of Crimea and the revolt in eastern Ukraine. Two Crimean energy businesses had already had their EU holdings frozen. Earlier on Friday, EU ambassadors reached a preliminary deal on further sanctions against Russia, targeting its access to European capital markets and trade in the defence sector, dual-use goods and sensitive technologies. It is likely that these proposals will be agreed by EU member states this week. The EU&apos;s decision to help Ukraine in restoring law and order in its regions will inevitably fuel Moscow&apos;s anger at what is perceived as meddling by the west in the affairs of eastern Ukraine. In a statement quietly released by Brussels, Ashton said the EU security advisers were non-military and unarmed. &quot;The Ukrainian authorities have embarked on the critical path of civilian security sector reform and have requested the support of the European Union,&quot; she said. &quot;The EU is deploying this mission to assist Ukraine in this reform, including police and the rule of law.&quot; Robert Shlegel, an MP of the ruling United Russia party who used to be federal commissar of the now-defunct pro-Putin youth movement Nashi, said Ukraine needed a government independent of the EU to promote economic growth. He told the Observer: &quot;It won&apos;t change anything even if there will be European police in Kiev. What will happen next? Will apartments be built? Will the investment climate get better? Will the war end?&quot; On Saturday, Ukrainian forces were advancing to the outskirts of a key town in pursuit of pro-Russia separatists in one of their main strongholds near to where flight MH17 crashed. National security spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Ukrainian forces were outside Horlikva, north of Donetsk. Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak will travel to the Netherlands on Wednesday to discuss the downing of the Malaysia Airlines jet with his Dutch counterpart. Najib said in a statement that he and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte will discuss securing full access to the crash site and whether Malaysian pathologists can help in &quot;expediting the process of identifying the human remains&quot;.

They miss the new at the moment of its passing. Sometimes they miss the old and valuable altogether. This is so \u2013 in both cases \u2013 with Nottingham Contemporary&apos;s pairing of the Danish-Vietnamese artist Danh V\u00f5 (born 1975, and pronounced Yan Voe) and the Italian painter Carol Rama (born 1918). Rama won the Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Biennale in 2003, but has only had one solo show in Britain so far, at the Baltic almost a decade ago when she was a mere 86. V\u00f5 won the Hugo Boss award in 2012, and has had one-man shows from the Guggenheim in New York to the Stedelijk museum in Amsterdam, but not on this scale so far in Britain. On the strength of this strange, elusive and affecting presentation in Nottingham, one may predict that this first major show certainly won&apos;t be his last. Presentation seems the right word because so much of V\u00f5&apos;s work involves setting forth photographs, letters, mementoes and curious relics of the lives of those he loves and admires in the subtlest of ways so that one starts to notice unusual echoes. So at Nottingham Contemporary you see a photograph of his paternal grandmother in a long frock and crucifix, the only true focus of this old black-and-white image one of her hard-worked hands, the rest of her person and face almost lost to the camera&apos;s scrutiny. She would disappear during the Vietnam war.     Oma Totem, 2009, is made of objects belonging to V\u00f5\u2019s grandmother.     And in the next gallery, there is another wooden crucifix, this one glued to an old fridge in a stack of white goods rising up like a totem pole, a TV perched on the top. It could so easily be a crude tirade against western capitalism but the effect in the gallery is altogether different. Battered but well-used, meagre and old, these objects seem to stand for some tiny, narrow space in which they themselves once stood, and sure enough they were given to V\u00f5&apos;s maternal grandmother by the Immigrant Relief Programme when she managed to escape Vietnam for Europe in the 1970s. And here are other wooden crosses, one after another, around the necks of five 19th-century missionaries photographed in their long-ago lives, about to depart Europe for Vietnam; and several more \u2013 or at least their dark silhouettes \u2013 like ghosts on sepia-coloured velvet drapes suspended from the ceiling. These are the shadows of crucifixes that once stood against these drapes (which have in turn become vast natural photographs, slightly out of focus) in the Vatican museum. V\u00f5 keeps the crucifix in mind, and in play, as he moves between real people and vast institutions, between tidal history and individual lives across whole continents, never failing to find the poignant intersections between them encapsulated in the material objects he has discovered, preserved and presented. But although his own sensibility as an artist is very diffident and modest \u2013 the works are sparse, delicate, quietly offered without assertion, text or caption \u2013 it is obvious that V\u00f5&apos;s own life must provide the ultimate link. Born the year the war ended, V\u00f5 escaped from a refugee camp with his family in a boat made by his father. They aimed for America but were rescued by a Danish tanker, which took them to Copenhagen. The first cigarette lighter his father managed to buy in Denmark appears here, spotlit in a silk-lined box like some fragile reliquary. When his father dies, V\u00f5 will present it to the Walker museum in America in exchange for the monument he has carved for his father, currently on display there \u2013 a work of art in return for an American lighter, symbol of hope to his father&apos;s generation. What a reversal: such are the new uses of art. A large part of this show is devoted to the photographs taken by an American in Vietnam, which do not show the war so much as the loving affection between young Vietnamese men. Joseph Carrier was a counterinsurgency agent for the Rand Corporation. He might have taken photographs of potential rebels against the communist regime, but he clearly began to feel the same loving affection himself. One of his letters is displayed, suggesting a kind of happiness \u2013 the good life, he calls it \u2013 found even in all the horror. Carrier bequeathed these images to the artist (they became friends), for whom they may represent a better Vietnam than he could ever have known. They feel like autobiography by other means.     Danh V\u00f5: Bye bye, 2010, a 19th-century portrait of missionaries about to set off for Vietnam.     And these photographs come to mind again in the image of the five French missionaries, two of whom are gently linking fingers as they voyage towards certain death. And this image holds fast, in turn, as one encounters the final, most beautiful work in the show. This is the last letter sent home to his father by one of these young men, Jean-Th\u00e9ophane Venard, who was about to be beheaded by the Vietnamese in 1861. He wishes to reassure his honourable father back in France that it will only be the cutting of one more flower in the world&apos;s magnificent garden. This letter has been exquisitely copied by V\u00f5&apos;s own father, a calligrapher in Vietnam whose gifts are useless in Denmark because he cannot read any European languages. His version is an image, as much as a transcription. Ph\u00f9ng V\u00f5 will continue to copy V\u00e9nard&apos;s letter until he is no longer able to use a brush, and anyone may commission him to do so, giving him back his profession. It is the continuation of a son&apos;s respect for his father extended over two centuries, and a making of art out of this most heroic of loving farewells. In a further act of homage, V\u00f5 has worked on Carol Rama&apos;s show too. Her art is abrupt, unprotected in its candour and characterised by sexual visions and wild materials \u2013 dolls&apos; eyes, birds&apos; claws, flattened inner tubes of bicycle tyres made in her father&apos;s factory before it went bust and he committed suicide in the 1940s. These are draped like forlorn hair, or mottled with puncture plasters, their surface like injured skin. Much of what she makes \u2013 bronze shoes, a gilded fox coiled on a canvas \u2013 has the aura of a fetish. The works range from early erotic watercolours to late-flowering surrealism and abstraction without settling into anyone else&apos;s style. It is no surprise to learn that they all come from the same dimly lit flat in Turin. For to see them together \u2013 serpentine, anxious, studded with seeds, beads and eyes \u2013 is to sense something darkly private emerging into the light. Danh V\u00f5 and Carol Rama is at Nottingham Contemporary until 28 September \u2022 This article was amended on 29 July 2014.

Andrew Colvin, the deputy commissioner of the Australian federal police (AFP), also confirmed he was uncomfortable with the hazards facing unarmed officers seeking to enter the rebel-held area. In a briefing to the media in Canberra on Monday, Colvin said the AFP was taking steps to reduce the risks and was in direct contact with the separatists via the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). A multinational team cancelled a visit to the wreckage site on Sunday based on an assessment that intense fighting between Ukrainian and pro-Russia separatist forces made the mission too dangerous at that stage. The 49-member team, including AFP and Dutch officers and OSCE personnel, would attempt to gain access to the \u201chighly volatile area\u201d later on Monday but safety considerations remained paramount, Colvin said. Flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, including 38 Australian citizens and residents. Asked whether it was now likely that not all of the victims\u2019 remains would get back to the Netherlands for identification, Colvin said: \u201cI think we have to consider that as a possibility.\u201d He added: \u201cI won&apos;t say it&apos;s a likely situation but we have to consider, as we have from day one, given a range of factors, given the spread of the crime scene, given the nature of this disaster, the trauma on the bodies of the victims, and now given these added complications of not being certain about when we\u2019ll get access [and] the environmental factors, we have to prepare ourselves for the possibility that not all remains will ultimately be recovered.\u201d Colvin said potential evidence might be lost if intense fighting continued in the area where the Boeing 777 came down. He said it was a \u201cpossibility\u201d that the multinational team would not be able to enter the site \u201cin the near future\u201d. \u201cOf course, it takes time to get into the site, it takes time for us to set up and do what we need to do,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cWe need to be mindful of how much time is required to be effective on any given day. We don&apos;t want to put our officers in danger for the sake of a brief look at the site. We\u2019ve had a look at the site already \u2026 the next stage of this is to get in there and start the examination.\u201d Colvin said access would depend on an assessment that the conditions were \u201cpermissive\u201d. It was a region where the sounds of gunfire and shelling were \u201ca normal part of the day\u201d, he said. The OSCE advanced ahead of the rest of the multinational team overnight and came back with an assessment that the risks were too great. \u201cWe are using the monitors from the OSCE as our intermediaries [with the rebels],\u201d Colvin said. \u201cI say intermediaries but we are there with them along with the Dutch when we meet with the separatist fighters and those that are in a degree of governance of the area to which we need access, so I would say that yes, we are in direct contact with them. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly very confident in the information we&apos;re getting, we\u2019re very confident in the role that OSCE are providing, so we&apos;re satisfied with the information that we have available.\u201d Colvin said the risks were \u201cobvious\u201d and \u201cmany\u201d as it was a conflict zone where fighting had intensified overnight. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, and the AFP commissioner, Tony Negus, said on Sunday the multinational force would be seeking to enter the site unarmed because this was likely to ensure a safer, more permissive environment. But when asked on Monday whether he was comfortable with sending his officers in unarmed, Colvin conceded that he held concerns.  \u201cComfortable is a broad word. No, we can&apos;t be comfortable, but \u2026 we have mitigated the risk, we have dealt with the risk to a point where we wouldn&apos;t send our people into a situation where we didn&apos;t think that they would be safe,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cOf course, this is a difficult environment and the Australian Federal Police have deployed on many occasions overseas to do disaster victim identification, to do responses to tragic events and terrorist events. We haven&apos;t deployed into a conflict zone in this manner before.\u201d Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, who has been involved in talks in Ukraine, emphasised that the nature of the Dutch-led mission was humanitarian in nature. \u201cThis has always been a risk,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that this plane was shot down over a war zone and that news that the fighting has intensified is perhaps inevitable, but we are planning for those risks, we will mitigate those risks and we\u2019ll make sure that our police investigators are safe when they go in and we won\u2019t take steps that would put them in danger.\u201d The Labor opposition has offered its \u201cfull support\u201d for the deployment of AFP officers as part of a Dutch-led unarmed police operation. \u201cThere is no doubt this will be a difficult mission, but Labor has full confidence in the skill and professionalism of the AFP officers undertaking this task,\u201d the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, and its foreign affairs spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, said in a statement on Sunday.", "sentences": ["Flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, including 38 Australian citizens and residents."], "title": "Flight MH17: victims\u2019 remains might not all be found, AFP warns", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/28/flight-mh17-victims-remains-might-not-all-be-found-afp-warns", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Ukraine", "Australia news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-29T14:59:36Z", "article": "My name is Jennifer Lenhart and I\u2019m a PhD candidate examining urban climate change governance at Wageningen University and a writer for Earth Negotiations Bulletin, covering multilateral environmental agreements. Half Swedish and half American, I\u2019ve lived in 20 cities in eight countries on four continents. I think \u2018Cosmopolitan nomad\u2019 fits best. I love cities, and more than that, I love learning from cities.  Like a sponge, I soak up a city\u2019s planning or its cycle strategies by walking or cycling its parks and green spaces with a picnic or sampling the neighbourhood pub with a beer. After all, sustainable cities are about quality of life, community, and the pleasure of urban living. My most recent muse is the creative, historic and sustainable city of Amsterdam.   Tell us about your city     Late evening light as seen on the Amstel river. All photographs: Jennifer Lenhart    Amsterdam is very international and for the last four years it\u2019s been my home. Referred to as a large village, its cozy corners and the friendly (yet honest) attitude of \u201cthe Dutchies\u201d make it easy to find your own space in the city. Still, there is always something to discover and the best way to do so is by bicycle.  Amsterdam is a photographer\u2019s dream and I always have my camera close at hand. My Dutch friends make fun of me for this, but later appreciate how I notice the quirky features of Amsterdam that a Dutch person takes for granted. My favourite images are dogs on bikes, tulip-lined canal bridges, or watching to see how many children a Dutch parent can balance on two wheels. There are many notable and admirable aspects to Amsterdam living, but the bicycle lifestyle remains my favourite. What\u2019s the best building?      Nemo science museum, a new Amsterdam icon.     For roof terraces atop stunning architecture, I love the Nemo science museum. For buildings exemplifying the Amsterdam school of architecture, I love the grandeur of Oud Zuid \u2013 home of the 1928 Olympics. Amsterdam has also mastered the creative use of post-industrial buildings, giving stark venues new life. My favourites: the former garage turned bouldering gym of Monk or the shipyard turned urban beach pub of Roest. As a PhD student, I love Amsterdam Central Library \u2013 such venues and views really do inspire learning. However, Amsterdam\u2019s greatest building is not a building at all. It\u2019s the narrow canals \u2013 grachten \u2013 which form Amsterdam\u2019s centre that are perhaps its greatest architectural triumph. Former warehouses turned fancy apartments with quaint pubs and boutique shops line the canals; many are centuries old. Cobbled streets, houseboats and narrow brick buildings, featuring giant picture windows and flower-filled boxes, complete the scene. It\u2019s like a painting. No wonder Amsterdam inspired so many master painters. \u2026 and the worst?     Vrije Universiteit \u2026 the University of Amsterdam. A building you\u2019ll love to hate.     I\u2019m rather fond of Amsterdam\u2019s architecture and urban planning, so this is difficult. The city didn\u2019t escape the brutal realities of the 1960s/1970s architecture; however it isn\u2019t overly apparent either \u2013 at least not in the centre. Like much of post-war Europe, Amsterdam erected massive high-rise housing blocks on the fringe of the city, the most famous being Bijlmeermeer built in 1966 with some 40,000 dwellings. From the air, the design is rather impressive; from the ground, the human scale is missing.  Another building(s) I love-hate is the main campus of Vrije Universiteit. It\u2019s an excellent academic institution, but is housed in some of the most uninspiring buildings \u2013 the colour of a grey Dutch winter. For some reason, many Dutch universities adopted a love of concrete for a period of years. Thankfully this love affair is over. The VU\u2019s newer buildings are more aesthetically pleasing and, perhaps, more conducive to learning.  How clean is your city?     Dutch cleanliness revealed.     Amsterdamers take pride in maintaining their homes and their streets. The Dutch love dogs; but it is fairly common to find small signs in garden patches with a red dash over the image of a squatting dog. This attitude is not just for pets. Home to the red light district and a popular spot for drunken stag parties, Amsterdam can be wild; to address this, public urinals abound.  The canals occasionally fill with litter after holidays, however my Dutch friends state with pride that they are clean enough to swim in \u2013 although I\u2019ve yet to see anyone willingly jump in. That being said, on hot summer days I enjoy a swim in the Amstel river or the waterways on the city outskirts. Finally, with bikes, buses, trams, trains and metros, Amsterdam is a transport planner\u2019s dream with the side effect of having excellent air quality. What\u2019s the best way to get around?      Cycling under Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum, connecting the city centre to Museumplein.    This is easy: by bicycle. Amsterdam is a cyclist\u2019s paradise, and most Amsterdamers own several bikes. I have four, and a name for each one. The cycling infrastructure is incredible \u2013 segregated, raised or clearly marked bike lanes on congested streets, while bicycles have free range in neighbourhoods or along canals, passing each other, or even cars that proceed more cautiously. Amsterdam\u2019s tourist information actually warns against driving in Amsterdam and generally drivers are mindful of cyclists.  I love cycling through Vondelpark, or under the Rijksmuseum. Admittedly though, I\u2019ve become a classic Amsterdam cyclist: leaving too late, running the lights and impatiently passing wide-eyed cycle tourists. Cycling in Amsterdam may seem chaotic, but as Street Films pointed out, there\u2019s a science to it. Still, if cycling isn\u2019t your thing, Amsterdam has a great public transport network and useful apps (see 9292.nl) to help you navigate the city which are available in Dutch and English.  What does your city sound like?     The sounds of Amsterdam are often that of boat motors    For a big city, Amsterdam is fairly quiet. If you are sitting on a canal on a warm summer night, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear the rumblings of a motorboat. Many Amsterdamers own boats, large and small, and enjoy any excuse to cruise the canals. The sounds of music and laughter are common, coming from the boats below or the bars above. Closer to the centre, Amsterdam sounds like a bell: the ringing of a bicycle bell to warn pedestrians to get off the bike path, or the ringing of a tram bell to warn cyclists to get off the tramway. I used to live on Albert Cupystraat, a market street open six days a week. There, Amsterdam sounds like clanking metal poles reassembled daily to the jolly songs of market men. Although the tunes were less appreciated at 5am, however. What\u2019s the best spot for a conversation?      Finding a private corner in Vondelpark.    Amsterdam has so many charming places for a coffee, a beer, or a conversation that I\u2019ll admit to becoming a bit snobbish. Weather permitting, I want to sit outside with the sun on my face, overlooking a canal or in a park. I prefer cafes with few passing cars; where bicycles, boats or pedestrians dominate. My favourite canal-side cafes are: Ysbreeker cafe on the Amstel or Caf\u00e9 de Jaren off Rokin canal. Both are elegant, but not pretentious, and large enough that you can take an hour for a lazy cappuccino and a good chat.  For more low-key venues, Hannekes Boom is great \u2013 especially in the summer. If the tables are full, they serve you in the sand or on the boat dock. For green spaces, Het Blauwe Theehuis in Vondelpark is lovely, and can be followed by a leisurely stroll, or finding a more private corner to continue the conversation. Name one thing that is indispensible for life in your city  Amsterdam is a beautiful city, but it is also quite often a rainy city \u2013 so don\u2019t forget your raingear. And, since the bicycle is the most common mode of transport, getting wet is inevitable. Most Dutchies keep a cheap pair of rain pants in the saddlebags attached to the back of their bike.  It\u2019s also not uncommon to see businessmen on their way to the office, casually holding an umbrella while cycling at full speed in the wind and the rain. For this, the Dutch invented a more aerodynamic version of the common umbrella \u2013 the senz\u00b0. There is even an umbrella clamp available to mount your umbrella to your bicycle, making rainy day cycling almost as enjoyable as a warm summer\u2019s day \u2013 OK, making rainy cycling bearable \u2026   Are you optimistic about your city\u2019s future? Amsterdam is not without problems, but it is moving in the right direction. Still, some challenges are beyond its control. As a climate change researcher, it\u2019s fascinating to follow the city\u2019s climate strategies to see how this low-lying city will adapt to changing realities. Amsterdam plans to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% before 2025, compared to 1990 levels, including a focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy and electric transport. Spatial planning is prioritised for adaptation, including a focus on urban green space, a water resilience strategy, and the use of climate impact maps. Learning is also important.

Boris Johnson\u2019s top air quality officials told the Guardian that it was \u201cludicrous\u201d to put London in the same category as capitals such as Mexico City, Delhi and Beijing, and other cities.  \u201cIt\u2019s not even comparing apples with pears, it is comparing apples with cucumbers,\u201d said Matthew Pencharz, the mayor\u2019s adviser on environment and energy.  Pencharz claimed other cities frequently site their air quality monitoring stations far from the sources of the worst pollution, for instance in parks, quiet roads or suburbs, but that London\u2019s monitoring stations are \u201cmore reliable\u201d because they are sited near busy roads. Levels of NO2 on Oxford Street in 2013 were at an annual mean of 135 \u03bcg m-3, according to samples taken by the London Air Quality Network.  Other data analysed by the European Environment Agency also showed London topping Europe\u2019s cities for air pollution, though at lower levels than the Oxford Street samples, which were not submitted for the agency\u2019s consideration.  Under the EEA\u2019s analysis, Marylebone Road, a busy London road where pollution levels frequently exceed the EU\u2019s legal maximum, was found to be the worst in Europe in 2012, with 94 \u03bcg m-3, compared to a maximum of 40 \u03bcg m-3 which is considered by the EU to be the upper safe limit for human health. The next worst European cities were Stuttgart, with 91 \u03bcg m-3 at one site and 90 \u03bcg m-3 at another, and Paris with 90 \u03bcg m-3 at one site.     NO2 data   But Pencharz said that the data cited was not representative, because other cities have fewer monitoring stations and submit less data. London had more monitoring stations than Paris or Rome, for instance, with 157 sites compared to 32 in Paris, 13 in Rome, 17 in Berlin and 19 in Amsterdam, in 2011. He also said other cities frequently sited their monitoring stations away from some of their main polluting sites, and therefore were not as reliable as the UK.  The mayor\u2019s office said: \u201cMore monitoring stations means we can do the responsible thing and place our monitoring stations directly in the most polluted roads. Some cities place their monitoring stations in vast green parks or traffic-free courtyards, hence the lower figures they report. That\u2019s why Oxford Street records comparatively high levels of pollution than for many other cities \u2013 but to say it is the worst of any place on Earth is misleading.\u201d  Martin Adams of the European Environment Agency confirmed that member states could pick the data they wanted to submit on air quality, provided that it met certain criteria and a minimum number of sampling stations were included. \u201cThat is the flexibility that member states have,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThat is the responsibility of member states \u2013 to choose the monitoring stations [from which they submit data].\u201d Pencharz also said London was leading the world\u2019s cities in improving air quality. He has said that emissions of NOx have fallen on average by a fifth since Johnson was elected, and the number of Londoners living in areas that break EU limits for the gas had been halved. NO2 can contribute to breathing difficulties, and is a particular problem for young children, older people and susceptible adults, such as those with existing respiratory conditions. Diesel-fuelled vehicles are a major source of the pollutant, and London is facing hefty fines from the European Union for flouting NO2 limits. Johnson unveiled plans on Tuesday to double the current congestion charge for drivers of diesel-powered vehicles. He said that diesel was worse for air pollution than alternatives including petrol, electric vehicles and other transport. The new plans \u2013 which must be put out to consultation before they can be adopted \u2013 would not come into force until 2020.", "sentences": ["London had more monitoring stations than Paris or Rome, for instance, with 157 sites compared to 32 in Paris, 13 in Rome, 17 in Berlin and 19 in Amsterdam, in 2011."], "title": "Boris Johnson defends London's record on air pollution", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/30/boris-johnson-defends-londons-record-on-air-pollution", "tags": ["Pollution", "Environment", "Boris Johnson", "Politics", "UK news", "Travel and transport", "London"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-07-31T20:45:01Z", "article": "Julius R\u00f6ntgen (1855-1932) was born in Leipzig \u2013 where his father was leader of the Gewandhaus Orchestra \u2013 and was something of a child prodigy as a violinist and pianist.

The Arctic Sunrise, one of three of the group\u2019s fleet, left Murmansk in the Arctic circle on Friday, following several weeks of repairs. Last September, the ship was held in custody by Russian authorities and 30 campaigners and journalists were imprisoned after two Greenpeace activists boarded a Gazprom oil rig in protest at the company\u2019s plans to drill for oil in the Arctic.  The detainment of the so-called \u201cArctic 30\u201d without charge prompted international calls for them to be freed, leading to the Russian authorities eventually bailing the final activist in November 2013. Greenpeace said the ship, which Russia released in June, was in a state of disrepair when crew were finally given access to it. Greenpeace International Arctic campaigner Faiza Oulahsen said: \u201cWhen the captain and crew boarded the Arctic Sunrise they found it in a bad state, with no maintenance for 10 months, and the ship\u2019s navigation, communications and safety systems either removed or destroyed.  \u201cThe Arctic Sunrise is now headed for Amsterdam, where the ship will need to undergo extensive repairs, so that it can get back to protecting the Arctic from reckless oil companies like Shell and Gazprom\u201d.

The formula for price rises is based on the July retail price index, enough to add at least another \u00a3100 to season tickets for many at a time when wage levels are stagnant at best. Unlike rail systems in Europe, which often charge passengers on a simple per-km basis, Britain&apos;s train companies have created a complex maze of fares that bewilders ticket buyers \u2013 and creates extraordinary anomalies. In the past, Guardian Money has highlighted ways to cut costs, such as railcards, split ticketing, fare alerts and so on. This week we went in search of some of the most extreme prices \u2013 ultra-high and ultra-low \u2013 which highlight the mystifying nature of rail pricing in Britain. Meanwhile, campaigners are calling for price simplification. Martin Abrams from the Campaign for Better Transport says: &quot;It&apos;s almost impossible for passengers to be sure they&apos;re getting good value for money. Information is patchy and successive governments have increased regulated rail fares above wage growth for 10 years running. We&apos;re calling for government to work with the train companies to provide cheaper, simpler and fairer fares, where all passengers know they&apos;re getting a good deal.&quot; Below are some examples of what we found, but our list is far from exhaustive. There may be even more anomalous fares that you know of \u2013 join the discussion online at theguardian.com/money. There you will also find a video on how to cut the cost of rail tickets.           The cheap deals London to Nottingham: \u00a36 each way Go on National Rail and tap &quot;London St Pancras to Nottingham one way&quot; for a midweek date in August. The cheapest fare will be \u00a315, and the worst \u00a355.20. Outside of rush hour, the standard cost for an Advance fare is \u00a317, which doesn&apos;t\u00a0seem too bad for a 120-mile journey. Yet you can travel on the same East Midlands train, on a journey taking the same one hour and 40 minutes, for a third of that price. Megatrain, a subsidiary of Stagecoach, which runs East Midlands Trains, sells tickets for just \u00a36-\u00a38. For example, the 10.15am London to Nottingham on Wednesday 27 August is \u00a317 on both the National Rail and East\u00a0Midlands sites, but \u00a36 on Megatrain. There are drawbacks to the Megatrain service, though. When we checked, it wasn&apos;t offering fares leaving the same day or the next day. We found that on the Nottingham route, travellers needed to book at least 72 hours in advance, and then prices were around \u00a315 to \u00a318, still a saving on the \u00a323 that National Rail would want. Further out, we found it was only open for bookings until 12\u00a0September, infuriatingly short of the 22 September start of Freshers&apos; Week at Nottingham University. Birmingham to Edinburgh: \u00a33 That&apos;s not a misprint. It&apos;s a journey of 246 miles, so \u00a33 is equal to just 1.2p a mile. It&apos;s a direct train and you don&apos;t have to change. The bad news is that it&apos;s the 6.16am on Virgin Trains departing from Birmingham New Street to Edinburgh Waverley, so you&apos;ll have to be up early. What&apos;s more, you won&apos;t find\u00a0this fare on either Virgin or National \u00a0Rail, which charge \u00a316 for the same train \u2013 still reasonable but a lot more than \u00a33. To put this fare into context, if you booked the 6.30am to Edinburgh it would be \u00a3107 \u2013 and would actually get you into the city after the \u00a33 train leaving at 6.15am. The departures after that \u2013 at 7.03 and 8.03 \u2013 are priced at \u00a361.40. So where do you find this fare? Once again, it is at Megatrain. But you&apos;re looking for a needle in a haystack to find it. When we searched this week, we found the \u00a33 fare on Wednesday 10 September, with the fare jumping to \u00a37 between 2\u00a0September and 11 September, with none available before or after those dates. Megatrain only really covers East Midlands, Virgin and South West trains, and then only a few of their services, but it&apos;s worth a try if you are booking in advance and can be flexible about when you travel. London to Dublin: \u00a338 This is a journey of nearly 300 miles by Virgin train from London Euston to Holyhead, then 75 miles on a ferry to the Irish capital. The standard one-way train fare to Holyhead is \u00a373 if booked ahead, or \u00a391.60 if bought on the day. The ferry is \u00a329 for a foot passenger, making a total of up to \u00a3120.60. But if you go to SailRail, operated by Arriva Trains Wales, you can buy a single ticket for both the train and ferry for \u00a338 per person, rising to \u00a343 if you buy on the day. It&apos;s great value if you need to travel at the last minute and don&apos;t want to pay the extortionate prices airlines charge for walk-up fares. Want to go anywhere in the Netherlands? A similar deal, called the Dutch Flyer, is offered by Greater Anglia Trains with Stena Line, at a cost of just \u00a345 each way booked in advance, rising to \u00a365 if bought on the day of travel. Passengers can travel from any station in the Greater Anglia area (such as London Liverpool Street or Colchester) to Harwich, catch the boat, then use the ticket for onward travel anywhere in the Netherlands, including Amsterdam. The drawback is the early start: trains leave London at 6.38am, and after a six-and-a-half-hour ferry to Hook of Holland you can expect to arrive in Amsterdam at 7pm. Tiverton to Penzance: \u00a320.10 return It&apos;s not the busiest route in the country and it&apos;s not madly cheap. But it&apos;s a good example of a walk-up (although off-peak) fare, not booked in advance, where the price is not ludicrous. Barry Doe, an expert on train fares around Britain, says that First Great Western offers some of the best off-peak day returns in the country. This one works out at 6.8p a mile. He also picks the fares offered by London Midland on its Birmingham/Euston route, which are priced at \u00a323 off-peak \u2013 which works out at 10p a mile compared to the 22p a mile cost of getting from London to Manchester on a standard off-peak walk-up fare. Sheffield to London: \u00a320 return It&apos;s always worth checking individual train websites for their &quot;sales&quot;. Currently East Midlands Trains is offering returns from Sheffield to London St Pancras at \u00a330 standard class and \u00a350 first class, reduced to \u00a320 and \u00a335 if you have a railcard. But you&apos;ll have to be quick \u2013 the sale ends on 4 August, although you can travel any time over the next six weeks. Cheapest conventional advance fares on this route are around \u00a344 return. Virgin tends to hold a summer first-class seat sale (although it has just finished) while South West Trains has &quot;Winter Smiles&quot; tickets, where it offloads same-day returns across its network for \u00a310 in January and February, making journeys such as London Waterloo to Exeter, Portsmouth or Southampton a bargain.       Weird train pricing: fares from London to Birmingham on Monday    Poorest value Commuter season tickets  Woking to London is a 23-mile commute, yet the season ticket costs \u00a33,704 a year. When the Campaign for Better Transport compared the route to similar-length journeys into other European capitals in 2011, it found that residents in the suburbs of Paris paid only \u00a3925, with the equivalent figure just \u00a3336 if you lived 23 miles outside Rome. So British commuters are paying between three and 10 times more per mile than European commuters. When it updated the figures in 2013, it found that the rate of increase in prices was faster in Britain than anywhere else. Long-distance fares, at peak times The standard-class walk-on single at peak time from London to Manchester is \u00a3160.50, equal to 87.4p a mile (a distance of 183 miles), says Barry Doe. We checked SNCF for a Paris-Lyon trip, buying on the same day of travel, and the price was \u00a380 on the TGV or \u00a354 on the slow train. So it&apos;s half the price for much further (288 miles). Fares that are more expensive the shorter the distance travelled Buy a London to York ticket for travel the next day (we tested Wednesday for Thursday this week) and National Rail wanted \u00a367 for the 8.30am leaving from Kings Cross. But if you buy a ticket for the exact same train, but travel to the next stop \u2013 Darlington, another 54 miles further up the line \u2013 the price drops to \u00a359.50. But don&apos;t try buying the ticket to Darlington and getting off the train one stop early at York, freeing up the seat for someone else. Breaking your journey early is forbidden by the rail companies. When you buy an Advance ticket you enter into a contract with the train company, which includes the condition that you must travel between the start and end stations and not &quot;stop short&quot;. A Durham University professor was fined \u00a3155 for stopping short on an East Coast train, which he described as &quot;absurd&quot;. The Heathrow Express A standard single is \u00a321 for the 15-mile journey from Paddington to the airport \u2013 regularly cited as one the most expensive airport-city transfers in the world. Going by Underground instead costs \u00a35 (with an Oyster card). From Madrid&apos;s airport to the city centre is \u20ac5 (\u00a33.95), while Paris Charles de Gaulle into the city \u2013 a journey of 25km \u2013 is \u20ac9.75 (\u00a37.70). Leicester Square to Covent Garden  An unwitting tourist may not realise this is a mere 300m, the shortest distance between two tube stops in London. Pay by cash and the fare is \u00a34.70, or \u00a32.20 with an Oyster card. A similar journey on the Paris metro is \u20ac1.70 (\u00a31.35) and in New York is $2.75 (\u00a31.62). Where to book     Photograph: Terry Harris/Alamy    Thetrainline.com, many people&apos;s default site for train travel, charges booking fees of up to \u00a31.50 and a credit card fee of 2% (using a debit card is free), adding \u00a32.50 to the price of a \u00a350 ticket, writes Emma Lunn. Rival comparison site Raileasy charges a hefty \u00a32.50 booking fee and a 4.5% credit card fee, adding a total of \u00a34.75 to a \u00a350 fare. It also charges for using a debit card (75p). Phoning Raileasy costs an eye-watering \u00a31.02 a minute from a BT landline. Train Genius and MyTrainTicket also charge booking and credit card fees. Rail operators&apos; own sites, on the other hand, don&apos;t charge extra. Another plus point is they occasionally offer cheaper fares and many offer loyalty points of some kind, too. For example, if you used thetrainline.com to pre-book the 11.30am train from London to Newcastle on 10 July, it would cost \u00a363.50, including the booking fee if you paid by debit card. Booking directly with East Coast would cost \u00a360.75 \u2013 and you could earn points on East Coast&apos;s own Rewards scheme. The scheme offers loyalty points when a customer spends more than \u00a322 on tickets with any train operator. East Coast isn&apos;t the only operator selling other rail companies&apos; tickets. They all do so, you don&apos;t need to know which companies operate which routes before you book. However, it&apos;s worth checking if a company offers discounts on its own tickets. Southern Railways, for example, offers customers booking direct discounts off Southern Advance tickets that are not available elsewhere. Meanwhile, CrossCountry allows customers to buy &quot;Advance Purchase on the Day&quot; tickets on its website on the day of travel. This saves money on walk-up fares but can only be booked on CrossCountry&apos;s website or mobile app. Out of the general booking sites, Red Spotted Hanky offers the best deal. Head For Points, a website that compares travel loyalty schemes, has declared it the only &quot;sensible&quot; third- party option for buying train tickets. As well as no booking or card fees, it offers its own loyalty scheme. Travellers can also spend Tesco Clubcard vouchers on Red Spotted Hanky: \u00a310 of Clubcard vouchers will get you a \u00a320 Red Spotted Hanky voucher. Rail operators usually start selling the cheapest tickets 12 weeks ahead of travel. Several sites, including thetrainline, East Coast and CrossCountry, allow you to set up email alerts to check when cheap tickets for your intended journey are released. \u2022 Come across a rail bargain or rip-off?

Before then, the region had only seen the odd surfing hippy or those looking for more intrepid spots, perhaps inspired by the footage of these same beaches in Bruce Brown\u2019s seminal 60s surf flick The Endless Summer. Black Star was the country\u2019s first significant surfing outpost. Now, with the addition of a second shop, Mr Brights, and the collaborative efforts of both businesses to build up the Ghana Surfing Association, the scene in Busua has been experiencing a momentum not felt since the Nardinis first started teaching local kids how to ride the waves. When Mr Brights (owned by Brett Davies, originally from Cornwall) opens his second shop in Kokrobite, the country\u2019s primary beach destination, near Accra, this summer, Ghana will be on its way to developing a countrywide scene.     MCs hype the crowd on Busua beach as the Easter celebrations get started.    But for now, visitors to this exotic stretch of coast dotted with peaceful villages and colonial slave forts can still enjoy the experience so coveted by the surfing community \u2013 being the only person in the water. As I paddle past the breakers, there are only a handful of other surfers out there to share the clean beach break that Busua enjoys at this time of the year. There\u2019s Etienne, a young German on a two-week surfing holiday, a couple of NGO workers down from the north of the country for the weekend, and three or four local teenagers, shredding effortlessly down the waves and putting everyone else to shame.     Surfers head out to sea for the Easter Sunday surf competition.     With gentle waves, 25C water and an apparent absence of sharks, the beach is an alluring proposition for anyone looking to learn to surf in a tropical destination off the usual circuit (and lessons with Black Star offer great value). It is perfect for beginner to intermediate surfers, but the more experienced can make easy trips along the coast to find more challenging, quieter and potentially unridden waves. The village of Dixcove, just round a headland, boasts a fantastic point break, surfed predominantly by incoming fishing boats, while Cape Three Points, a 30-minute drive west, has a sometimes surfable right-hand break on a wild beach that is completely deserted but for the Escape eco-treehouse resort, with its ramshackle bamboo bar. After a morning spent cruising the waves on a long board, I return to find that Busua has whirred back into party mode. The sound system is pumping from outside Coconut Dreams bar, MCs are hyping the crowd and at least 50 people have gathered to watch the surf competition. It\u2019s a true community event: young children dance with impressive fluidity in the sand, effortlessly ripped lads do backflips (losing their Ray-Bans in the process) and women in bright batik dresses cast their eyes over the action.     Busua was experiencing a \u201cGhanian Spring Break\u201d that weekend and dozens of visitors showed up to watch the surfing. In the blue t-shirt is Brett Davies, of Mr Brights Surf School    The biggest whoops and cheers are saved for teenager Michael \u201cBallack Obama\u201d Bentum, who became the first Ghanaian to win a surf contest outside the country when he took home a trophy from a recent competition in Ivory Coast. Not surprisingly, he steals the show this day, too. Even a power cut caused by a dramatic thunderstorm can\u2019t stop the dancing that evening; a generator keeps the speakers going till the early hours. As the weekend fades away, Busua gets back into the laid-back swing of daily life. For us, that means surfing every day (and there is surf, every day) and slowly moving between the beach, the restaurants and the small shops selling ice cold \u201cpure water\u201d out of 500ml plastic bags to keep us cool in the muggy 30C heat. We spend our evenings drinking Club lager and gossiping with locals, surfers and other travellers on the beach, before walking back through the dusty paths of the village at night. We pass sleeping goats and oil lamp-illuminated domestic scenes; a woman grinding yam with a long stick, or a man stitching fabric with an old Singer sewing machine.     Peter Ansah and Kofi Acquah inside the Black Star Surf Shop.    One evening we join Ben and Kofi for dinner at the Busua Inn. A French-Ghanain restaurant, it\u2019s a notably smarter choice for dinner than the other friendly, delicious yet low-key joints on the beach and the road behind it, such as Florence\u2019s and Okorye Tree. It\u2019s a chance to hear more from 24-year-old Kofi about how he came to join the steadily growing crew of surfers in the village. \u201cI had to learn to swim first,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d been trying to swim at the lagoon but almost drowned. I started surfing to be able to save people in trouble in the water. I started out working for Black Star about six years ago, helping out in the shop, but eventually I told Peter I just wanted to be surfing. Last year I got my life guard certificate.\u201d Kofi now gives lessons and hopes to eventually set up his own shop. He is especially proud to see the younger kids taking to the waves. The surf school is also partners with Black Star Development, which runs the Surf N Impact volunteer programme set up by Ebenezer Felix Bentum - who is also from Busua. The programme ties together surfing, environmentalism, community projects and education. \u201cWe do lessons with the local school children,\u201d says Ben. \u201cBut only if they turn up for classes. Attendance just went right up.\u201d     Ben Dewar (left) with the owner of the Coconut Dreams bar on Busua beach.     As the scene grows and attracts more tourists, other villages still largely untouched by tourism are becoming curious. \u201cSome of them find it really interesting,\u201d says Kofi, \u201cand some people in Agona and Takoradi just think its funny that I\u2019m teaching white people to do things.\u201d When the tide is less favourable and the waves a bit \u201cdumpy\u201d we explore the surrounding villages. Butre, to the east, can be reached via a spectacular walk (far safer to be done with a local guide), through the shrub and over the peninsula with views back over Busua. A few miles inland is Agona - taken over every Wednesday by a weekly market. Peter joins us on a walk westwards along the jungle path to Dixcove, a small bay filled with brightly painted fishing boats, their coloured flags \u2013from the Union Jack to the stars and stripes \u2013 flickering in the wind. While the village has the same affection for Chelsea FC as Busua (the club\u2019s crest can be found hand painted on carts and sheds) there is almost no sign of tourism there. Our arrival is greeted with cries of \u201cObruni! Obruni!\u201d (white person! white person!) from the local children. \u201cBibini!\u201d (meaning black person!) is the stock reply, usually greeted by laughs.     Kofi Stephen Yankey has seen Busua develop from a quiet fishing village into the heart of the country\u2019s surf scene.    As the night falls on our final evening, we take to the beach once more. Bamboo is piled up to make a bonfire and we drink and dance as the waves crash into darkness. I take the opportunity to speak to one of the village elders, Kofi Stephen Yankey, to find out more about Busua\u2019s past. Kofi, who\u2019s in his 70s and has lived in Busua for over 50 years, acts as security outside Black Star and Coconut Dreams, where he sits in dazzling Hawaiian shirts and shakes his stick at the kids if they get too close. He has seen Busua develop into an increasingly popular resort. Now, not least because of the laid-back and inclusive community cultivated by the surfers, visitors are more involved with village life. \u201cBefore, we could only sell kerosene and cigarettes to visitors,\u201d he says. \u201cNow everyone eats banku, everyone eats foo foo (Ghanaian casava dumplings). Previously, we would take any plank of wood and surf on our fronts. Now, things are very different.\u201d As the fire starts to dim, people drift off from the beach to their beds. We have only been in Busua for a week but every face is already a familiar one. \u201cThere\u2019s a phrase we have here,\u201d says Kofi, sipping on his beer, as I try to imagine him surfing on a plank as a youngster. \u201cA village without strangers is not a good village.\u201d \u2022 Flights were provided by KLM (020-7660 0293, klm.com), which flies from London Heathrow and 14 other UK regional airports to Accra via Amsterdam from \u00a3526 return.

South Padre Island, Texas  Think of surfing USA and California or Hawaii spring to mind, but there are plenty of breaks in the south, too. South Padre Island might be small but it\u2019s fairly crowd-free, and the temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico mean surfers don\u2019t often need wetsuits. Beachside Inn South Padre has rooms from $34. Niijima, Japan  While the island of Niijima has a rising surf scene and is popular with surfers from Tokyo, it remains quiet for most of the year and is the perfect place for a laid-back surfing trip.

The slang term typically reverses the word &quot;racaille&quot; or &quot;scum&quot;, which has found favour with rightwing politicos eager to knock the younger multiracial generation in rundown council estates, especially in the much-maligned suburbs, known as banlieues. The &quot;caillera&quot; fashion \u2013 a mix of sportswear labels and luxury logos \u2013 saw a golden age in the 90s with rap groups such as NTM (which stands for &quot;Nique ta M\u00e8re&quot; or &quot;Screw Your Mother&quot;), and Vincent Cassel&apos;s 1995 film La Haine finding international success. The Parisian contribution to the rapper look included Lacoste polo shirts, Louis Vuitton bags and an extra attention to slick detail.

Amsterdam has tightened restrictions on cannabis sales just as the number of clubs in Spain has proliferated from some 40 in 2010 to more than 700 today, say smokers&apos; groups. The Catalan capital is home to more than half of these clubs. From swanky clubs that span three floors to others with a small room and a few plastic chairs, the clubs take advantage of a provision in Spain&apos;s drug laws that allow marijuana to be grown and consumed for private use. The clause has turned Spain \u2013 and especially Barcelona \u2013 into what Spanish media call the &quot;Holland of the South&quot;. But unlike Amsterdam&apos;s coffee shops, which are open to the public, Spain&apos;s clubs are for members only. Skirting the membership policy is fairly easy; while many clubs stick to a policy of requiring new members to be sponsored by existing ones, a number of clubs allow prospective members to register online or via telephone. Some clubs have employees who hand out promotional flyers in the street, promising to ease the registration process. The past two years have seen hundreds of these cannabis clubs spring up in Barcelona, creating a thriving industry as other sectors suffered the economic crisis. Catalonia&apos;s cannabis clubs now count some 165,000 members, who rack up an estimated \u20ac5m (\u00a34m) in sales each month, according to El Pa\u00eds newspaper. Local officials in Barcelona have been watching closely. In June, the city imposed a one-year moratorium on new licences for cannabis clubs. Calling it a &quot;preventative&quot; measure, deputy mayor Joaquim Forn said it would give the city some breathing space to regulate the industry and &quot;avoid it becoming a serious problem&quot;. A first draft of the regulations, drawn up by the public health agency of Catalonia and obtained by El Pa\u00eds, sets out strict regulations on the cultivation and transport of the drug and clubs&apos; membership in an effort to chip away at the legal grey zone in which the clubs currently operate. Memberships will be limited to Spanish residents, taking aim at the region&apos;s growing reputation for cannabis tourism. Members will have to be 21 years of age or older and belong to the club for at least 15 days before being given access to marijuana. Other measures include forcing clubs to register their plants and undergo an annual inspection, in an attempt to give regional authorities a more complete idea of the product on offer in the region. The maximum quantity that members will be allowed to access each month has yet to be determined, said the proposal, but is expected to be somewhere between 60 to 100 grams a month (2-3.5 ounces). With some clubs currently with as many as 5,000 users, the draft noted that a maximum number of members must also be determined. The proposed regulations were welcomed by the Catalonia Federation of Cannabis Associations, one of many associations that has been pushing the government to better regulate the sector. While the association took issue with the draft regulations&apos; proposal of a fixed schedule that would force the clubs to close for a three-hour lunch each day and close by 8pm most days, the regulations were &quot;positive in general&quot;, a spokesman, Jaume Xaus, told El Pa\u00eds. Many of the clubs, he noted, already follow similar regulations. One notable omission, he said, was to set a criteria for municipal licences. Without this, he worried, the granting of permits would be left to individual mayors, allowing for discrepancies to arise.

For those who happened to be passing Victoria Tower Gardens, a swath of green adjacent to the Houses of Parliament, the sense of wonder and disorientation was immediate and powerful, with the surrounding trees and buildings bathed in a glow emanating from the base of the pillar of light: a\u00a0square of black matting on which 49 powerful spotlights beamed upwards as if into infinity. The work, called spectra, is by Japanese sound and light artist Ryoji Ikeda, a\u00a0quiet, self-contained young man whose vision is both minimalist and monumental. It&apos;s produced by the ever-adventurous Artangel, which brought you, among other projects, Rachel Whiteread&apos;s inside-out house in 1993, and Jem Finer&apos;s 1,000 year sound project, Longplayer, in 2000. Spectra was commissioned by the Mayor of London and 14-18 NOW (WW1 Centenary Art Commissions) as the centrepiece of its artistic commemoration of the start of the war. &quot;The light spectra throws up into the night sky is a unifying point,&quot; says Boris Johnson. &quot;It echoes how the first world war affected all Londoners, but also how they and the rest of the country came together, standing united during those dark days.&quot; Spectra will appear from darkness to dawn over the next seven days, and people are encouraged to visit the site and interact with the project by walking though the grid of spotlights, arranged in seven rows of seven. Ikeda has also created an ambient soundtrack to enhance the experience: waves of subsonic sound punctuated by beeps and hisses, emanating from four sets of speakers pointing inwards towards the light. It&apos;s as if an alien craft is beaming down to a soundtrack by Brian Eno. The 15km-high tower of light is the culmination of eight months of preparation and secrecy. When I was told about it a month ago, I joined an elect group that included Artangel, the artist and his crew, as well as the mayor and select members of the House of Lords and the Royal Parks. &quot;It is different to anything else we have commissioned on two counts,&quot; Artangel&apos;s co-directer, Michael Morris, explained as I walked around the site with him and Ikeda last week, while men in luminous jackets laid cables and fretted about the hot sunlight expanding the black matting beneath our feet. &quot;It is a work that will announce itself without any of the usual PR fanfare,&quot; he added, &quot;and it is a\u00a0work that already exists, insofar as it has been staged in various forms in several cities including Barcelona and Amsterdam. But this time, the context is very different because of the centenary of the first world war. My sense is that, on the first few nights, there will be a sense of reverence at the site. But then, as the numbers of people increase towards the weekend, it will no doubt take on a life of its own.&quot;     Ryoji Ikeda's Spectra being tested in Victoria Tower Gardens, London. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris for The Guardian    Ikeda, who exudes a focused calm throughout the preparations, nods. &quot;When you experience it,&quot; he says, &quot;any kind of context is suddenly gone. From a distance, it looks monumental and solid, but when you are in it, it is entirely meditative. People stare up in wonder. It causes necks to strain. The experience is so pure and direct, they can take it with them into their own life.&quot; Or project their own imaginings on to it \u2013 as when it was shown in Barcelona and hundreds of people phoned the police in a panic. &quot;They were convinced it was a UFO landing,&quot; says Ikeda, grinning, &quot;or a light from heaven.&quot; I visited the site again just before midnight on Sunday, when Ikeda and his technical crew had gathered for a rehearsal: a 10-minute trial run in which each spotlight was switched on and focused individually. For Morris and his Artangel co-director James Lingwood, who had brought along the British artist Jeremy Deller, this was the most nerve-wracking moment of the entire project, not just because of the very real possibility of a technical hitch, but also the threat of a surge of social-media interest prompted by passersby with their smartphones and Instagram accounts. &quot;There is no way around it,&quot; Ikeda told me calmly. &quot;It has to be tested, and it will take whatever time it takes to make the necessary adjustments. This is usually one minute per spotlight.&quot; Morris nodded nervously. &quot;That&apos;s 49 minutes, Ryoji,&quot; he said. &quot;Ten would be much better.&quot; So, just after midnight, the security light that had glared over the site, making the rows of encased spotlights look like metal gravestones, was turned off. As our eyes adjusted and two figures moved around the grid, the beams appeared one by one, then row by row, shooting silently up into the sky to a collective exhalation of breath. Ten minutes was all it took. Tentatively, I wandered through the grid, while ominous waves of sound washed over me. It felt threatening at first, but then, as I surrendered to the immersive nature of the project, oddly calming. The first thing you realise is that, for such a static, minimal piece, spectra is a living, constantly changing entity: dramatic and subtle, geometric and shape-shifting, opaque and yet somehow solid. Standing close to the middle, I looked up, and all 49 pillars of light seemed to converge at a point somewhere high above my head. Just how high was impossible to tell \u2013 distance, like perspective, is distorted. A few steps sideways and the geometric pattern shifted and lost its symmetry. Positioning myself at a corner, I looked up at what seemed to be a single wall of whiter light that split the grid diagonally. On cue, a splat and hiss of shrill sound suggested a fissure of some kind. The further back you go from the base, the taller and more solid it seems, as the thin beams become one. Across London, on elevated points like Primrose Hill or Crystal Palace, it looks like one single shaft of white light touching infinity somewhere high above the earth \u2013 one can only sense its epic reach on a cloudless night. A few minutes into the trial, spectra came alive in an entirely different way as moths and flies flickered in and out of the light, and condensation rose off the spotlights like dry ice. &quot;A bit Pink Floyd, that,&quot; said Deller. One can indeed imagine devotees of Meddle-era Floyd making a deep connection with the ambient soundtrack and flickering towers of light.     A long-distance view of Spectra. Photograph: William Eckersley    The history and logistics of spectra are intriguing. In Paris in 2008, it comprised a grid of 64 spotlights; in Amsterdam that same year, 25 spotlights pierced the sky at four different sites; in Buenos Aires in 2012, it took the form of a 100m-long linear projection. Ikeda has now settled on the 7x7 formation, which requires a crew of about 30 technicians, many from the Paris-based Skylight company, who designed and installed the spotlights that illuminate the Eiffel tower. It runs off four generators fuelled by biodiesel and, according to Ikeda, &quot;each spotlight is four kilowatts, so over the seven days, its total energy consumption will be equivalent to 10 to 20 households.&quot; For the next seven nights, spectra will become possibly the single most-viewed work of conceptual art ever, given that it will be hard for anyone living in London not to see it. And, as the weather changes, so will the nature of the light. &quot;I would kind of like it to rain,&quot; says Ikeda, &quot;because then the rainbows will appear inside it \u2013 and people like that.&quot; If it were to rain heavily, he adds,\u00a0&quot;it will become a bit more Blade Runner \u2013 needles of rain like steel falling upwards. Nature is visible all the\u00a0time in the work. That is spectra&apos;s real power.&quot; Last night, though, its power was more sombre: a vast tower of light pointing to the heavens in contrast to the single flickering candle left burning on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Westminster Abbey. The humble and the monumental, each in their own way, encouraging a sense of reflection and reminding us of that dark moment 100 years ago when, as the British foreign secretary Edward Grey famously remarked: &quot;The lamps are going out all over Europe \u2013 we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.&quot;", "sentences": ["&quot;It is a work that will announce itself without any of the usual PR fanfare,&quot; he added, &quot;and it is a\u00a0work that already exists, insofar as it has been staged in various forms in several cities including Barcelona and Amsterdam.", "In Paris in 2008, it comprised a grid of 64 spotlights; in Amsterdam that same year, 25 spotlights pierced the sky at four different sites; in Buenos Aires in 2012, it took the form of a 100m-long linear projection."], "title": "Spectra: the dazzling column of light over London", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/05/ryoji-ikeda-spectra-first-world-war-artangel", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Artangel", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-08-05T13:00:00Z", "article": "Last month, the Bernar Venet Foundation opened in the artist&apos;s beautiful home in Le Muy, an hour from Nice. Among the works on view \u2013 by appointment only \u2013 is a metal chain sculpture by Arman in the beautiful grounds, pieces by Richard Long and Frank Stella in the spacious hall, and a painting by Sol LeWitt in the living room. Although Bernar Venet has lived in New York since 1967, he established a foundation in his native Provence in order to house his own works as well as his collection of minimal art. His foundation is unusual in that it was set up under US tax law, with 100% of the value of the donated works and funds to be deducted from income tax. Along with the Portuguese Calouste-Gulbenkian Foundation, his foundation is one of few in France to operate under a foreign tax regime. There are some 3,220 foundations that operate under the French tax system. According to a study by the Observatoire de la Fondation de France, an independent body that monitors charitable and philanthropic institutions, the number soared by more than 60% between 2001 and 2010 as a result of tax breaks introduced in 2003. Companies benefit from a 60% tax deduction on donations up to 0.5% of annual turnover, while individuals can deduct 66% of their donation to a maximum of 20% of their taxable income. According to Laurence de Nervaux from the Observatoire, &quot;French tax measures in favour of sponsorship are the most advantageous in Europe.&quot; The legal framework is, however, extremely complex. State-approved foundations benefit from the most favourable tax regime. &quot;That status inspires confidence. It&apos;s a guarantee of sorts, but it&apos;s a long and expensive business,&quot; said Eve S\u00e9jalon, from the French Foundation Centre. &quot;First you must make a donation of at least \u20ac1.5m [$2m] that you won&apos;t be able to recover, and then you have to wait patiently for a year and a half until you obtain the approval of the council of state.&quot; Of the 626 state-approved foundations, 100 are devoted to culture. They include the Maison Rouge, a private contemporary art foundation established in Paris in 2004 by the collector Antoine de Galbert, and the Hippocr\u00e8ne Foundation, a family foundation, which donates \u20ac500,000 a year to some 40 European projects. Another method is to set up a foundation under the auspices of an existing state-approved foundation. Some 200 companies in France opt for this system, which requires a minimum endowment of \u20ac200,000 spread over five years. The founder is free of administrative management and benefits from the legitimacy of the &quot;parent&quot; foundation. Most companies prefer the corporate foundation system, which requires a minimum endowment of \u20ac150,000 spread over five years. It takes only four months to set up but the disadvantage is that it cannot call on the general public for funding, or obtain donations or legacies from anyone but the founding company&apos;s employees. Guillaume Houz\u00e9, chairman of the Galeries Lafayette Foundation, which has an endowment of \u20ac21m over five years, believes that this format enables a company to &quot;lay down its commitment in stone&quot; \u2014 in other words, to make it professional and lasting. Setting up a foundation is good for a company&apos;s image, including the way it is perceived by employees. &quot;When we established our foundation it changed the way people saw us. It shows that we&apos;re serious,&quot; said Colette Barbier, director of the Ricard Foundation, which has been supporting emerging artists since 2005. &quot;It has been a breath of fresh air to the company,&quot; added Louis Roederer, deputy CEO. Another type of foundation, which looks likely to grow in popularity, is the regional corporate foundation, which can be set up jointly by a group small and medium-sized companies. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to carry out corporate sponsorship on your own when your company only has an annual turnover of \u20ac1m,&quot; said Robert Fohr, in charge of the sponsorship unit at the French ministry of culture. &quot;By getting together, companies can do more and do it better.&quot; Since 2009, a new system has proved very popular: the French version of the US endowment fund. This can be set up within a fortnight at the prefecture headquarters, has no minimum financing requirement and only minimal governance. It has proved very successful with 1,660 such funds set up in just four years, more than 20% of which are involved in the cultural arena. The Fran\u00e7ois Pinault Foundation, established in Amsterdam by the eponymous millionaire, may soon switch to this highly flexible format. These funds were designed first and foremost as vehicles for individual philanthropy but are increasingly attracting companies, including the property development group Emerige, which has just set up its own contemporary art fund. For the hypermarket magnate, Michel-Edouard Leclerc, chairman of the H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Edouard Leclerc Fund for Culture in Landerneau (Brittany), the endowment fund guarantees independence. &quot;We can move faster because we don&apos;t have to answer to the government,&quot; he said. &quot;The only shortcoming is that the word &apos;fund&apos; doesn&apos;t carry as much weight as &apos;foundation&apos;&quot;. But the Bordeaux wine magnate, Bernard Magrez, believes that enthusiasm for these funds will die down. In 2012, 36% proved to be inactive, and 60% were just empty shells without any funding at all. The biennial survey carried out by Admical, an organisation that promotes the development of corporate sponsorship, highlighted a snag in this apparent profusion of funds and foundations. Cultural sponsorship, which totalled nearly \u20ac500m two years ago, has dropped to \u20ac364m. The survey showed that in 2012 more than 25% of corporate sponsorship was devoted to culture. But now it stands at 13%. The companies questioned, especially the smaller ones, stated that they had no short-term outlook on whether or not they would pursue their commitment. About 10% were considering reducing their sponsorship budget and 8% were thinking pulling out altogether. The reason, in addition to the economic crisis, which has hit small and medium-sized companies hard, lies in the current uncertainty over taxation. Since Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was elected in 2012, the government has regularly stated that it will reduce tax vehicles and companies fear they will bear the brunt. &quot;We need a clear message,&quot; said St\u00e9phane Martinez, chairman of Fondation M\u00e9c\u00e8nes et Loire. &quot;The government can&apos;t keep changing its mind, or telling us that sponsorship is a tax shelter. It&apos;s annoying.&quot; B\u00e9atrice de Durfort, chief representative of the French Foundation Centre, agrees. &quot;We have good sponsorship measures here that need to be grounded. Otherwise we&apos;ll lose everyone on the way.&quot;     Photograph: STR/Reuters    How different luxury brands approach sponsorship Luxury groups tend to set up foundations to promote contemporary art. Cartier was a pioneer in 1984 when it established its own under the auspices of the Fondation de France, an independent agency set up by the government in 1969. The Cartier Foundation has an annual budget of \u20ac10m ($13m). Although Cartier is synonymous with high-end watches and jewellery, the foundation promotes and supports popular art and emerging artists. &quot;We don&apos;t go in for sponsorship to the greater glory of Cartier, even though the name is useful because it is so well-known and respectable,&quot; said the foundation&apos;s chairman, Alain-Dominique Perrin. &quot;My first action was to forbid us from commissioning artists supported by the foundation for Cartier creations.&quot; The LVMH group, on the other hand, has asked artists such as Takashi Murakami and Yayoi Kusama to design leather goods, and in 2006 set up the Louis-Vuitton Foundation for Creation. The foundation&apos;s premises, designed by Frank Gehry, will open in October. LVMH has been a corporate sponsor since 1991 and has built up a contemporary art collection as well as sponsoring exhibitions. Herm\u00e8s came onto the scene in 2008, focusing on contemporary artists and artisans. &quot;The family was against the idea of a foundation at first,&quot; said Pierre-Alexis Dumas, chairman of the Herm\u00e8s Foundation. &quot;It wasn&apos;t the done thing to advertise any support we were giving, it was seen as boasting. And anyway Herm\u00e8s didn&apos;t need a foundation to exist as a brand.&quot; Public institutions, which often depend on donations from these groups, fear that these will be diverted to their foundations. &quot;Obviously choices have to be made,&quot; admitted Guillaume Houz\u00e9, chairman of the Galeries Lafayette Foundation. &quot;But our group continues to support public projects.&quot; RM This article appeared in the Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde", "sentences": ["The Fran\u00e7ois Pinault Foundation, established in Amsterdam by the eponymous millionaire, may soon switch to this highly flexible format."], "title": "Why France's big brands love a foundation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/05/france-corporate-sponsorship-foundation-decline", "tags": ["Business", "Corporate governance", "Luxury goods sector", "France", "Europe", "World news", "Corporate social responsibility", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-08-07T11:20:37Z", "article": "     iO: &apos;Tina Turner&apos; (starts at 00:06) - Switzerland The humour in this advert from a German agency for a telecommunications company is so dry that some of you will find themselves wondering why you didn&apos;t already know about Tina Turner&apos;s extraordinary love of Switzerland.\u00a0 She&apos;s actually a Swiss resident these days, but the hyperbolic reconstructions of her childhood and career are a beautifully-weighted spoof demonstrating that her devotion to the mountainous European state began very early in life.Agency: Heimat (Berlin)Director: Johan Kramer Brother: &apos;Circus&apos; (starts at 01:52) - UK A young man left in charge of the lighting booth at the big top is a tad nervous, but\u00a0 he&apos;s clearly relishing the opportunity to demonstrate his abilities.

One, in the Paris suburb of Sarcelles, was firebombed by a 400-strong mob. A kosher supermarket and pharmacy were smashed and looted; the crowd&apos;s chants and banners included &quot;Death to Jews&quot; and &quot;Slit Jews&apos; throats&quot;. That same weekend, in the Barbes neighbourhood of the capital, stone-throwing protesters burned Israeli flags: &quot;Israhell&quot;, read one banner. In Germany last month, molotov cocktails were lobbed into the Bergische synagogue in Wuppertal \u2013 previously destroyed on Kristallnacht \u2013 and a Berlin imam, Abu Bilal Ismail, called on Allah to &quot;destroy the Zionist Jews \u2026 Count them and kill them, to the very last one.&quot; Bottles were thrown through the window of an antisemitism campaigner in Frankfurt; an elderly Jewish man was beaten up at a pro-Israel rally in Hamburg; an Orthodox Jewish teenager punched in the face in Berlin. In several cities, chants at pro-Palestinian protests compared Israel&apos;s actions to the Holocaust; other notable slogans included: &quot;Jew, coward pig, come out and fight alone,&quot; and &quot;Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the\u00a0gas.&quot; Across Europe, the conflict in Gaza is breathing new life into some very old, and very ugly, demons. This is not unusual; police and Jewish civil rights organisations have long observed a noticeable spike in antisemitic incidents each time the Israeli-Palestinian conflict flares. During the three weeks of Israel&apos;s Operation Cast Lead in late 2008 and early 2009, France recorded 66 antisemitic incidents, including attacks on Jewish-owned restaurants and synagogues and a sharp increase in anti-Jewish graffiti.But according to academics and Jewish leaders, this time it is different. More than simply a reaction to the conflict, they say, the threats, hate speech and violent attacks feel like the expression of a much deeper and more widespread antisemitism, fuelled by a wide range of factors, that has been growing now for more than a decade. &quot;These are the worst times since the Nazi era,&quot; Dieter Graumann, president of Germany&apos;s Central Council of Jews, told the Guardian. &quot;On the streets, you hear things like &apos;the Jews should be gassed&apos;, &apos;the Jews should be burned&apos; \u2013 we haven&apos;t had that in Germany for decades. Anyone saying those slogans isn&apos;t criticising Israeli politics, it&apos;s just pure hatred against Jews: nothing else. And it&apos;s not just a German phenomenon. It&apos;s an outbreak of hatred against Jews so intense that it&apos;s very clear indeed.&quot; Roger Cukierman, president of France&apos;s Crif, said French Jews were &quot;anguished&quot; about an anti-Jewish backlash that goes far beyond even strongly felt political and humanitarian opposition to the current fighting: &quot;They are not screaming &apos;Death to the Israelis&apos; on the streets of Paris,&quot; Cukierman said last month. &quot;They are screaming &apos;Death to Jews&apos;.&quot; Crif&apos;s vice-president Yonathan Arfi said he &quot;utterly rejected&quot; the view that the latest increase in antisemitic incidents was down to events in Gaza. &quot;They have laid bare something far more profound,&quot; he said. Nor is it just Europe&apos;s Jewish leaders who are alarmed. Germany&apos;s chancellor, Angela Merkel, has called the recent incidents &quot;an attack on freedom and tolerance and our democratic state&quot;. The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, has spoken of &quot;intolerable&quot; and clearly antisemitic acts: &quot;To attack a Jew because he is a Jew is to attack France. To attack a synagogue and a kosher grocery store is quite simply antisemitism and racism&quot;.     Police at the site of a shooting at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, Belgium, where four people were killed. Photograph: Eric Vidal/REUTERS    France, whose 500,000-strong Jewish community is one of Europe&apos;s largest, and Germany, where the post-war exhortation of &quot;Never Again&quot; is part of the fabric of modern society, are not alone. In Austria last month, a pre-season friendly between Maccabi Haifa and German Bundesliga team SC Paderborn had to be rescheduled after the Israeli side&apos;s previous match was called off following an attempted assault on its players. The Netherlands&apos; main antisemitism watchdog, Cidi, had more than 70 calls from alarmed Jewish citizens in one week last month; the average is normally three to five. An Amsterdam rabbi, Binjamin Jacobs, had his front door stoned, and two Jewish women were attacked \u2013 one beaten, the other the victim of arson \u2013 after they hung Israeli flags from their balconies. In Belgium, a woman was reportedly turned away from a shop with the words: &quot;We don&apos;t currently sell to Jews.&quot; In Italy, the Jewish owners of dozens of shops and other businesses in Rome arrived to find swastikas and anti-Jewish slogans daubed on shutters and windows. One slogan read: &quot;Every Palestinian is like a comrade. Same enemy. Same barricade&quot;; another: &quot;Jews, your end is near.&quot; Abd al-Barr al-Rawdhi, an imam from the north eastern town of San Don\u00e0 di Piave, is to be deported after being video-recorded giving a sermon calling for the extermination of the Jews. There has been no violence in Spain, but the country&apos;s small Jewish population of 35,000-40,000 fears the situation is so tense that &quot;if it continues for too long, bad things will happen,&quot; the leader of Madrid&apos;s Jewish community, David Hatchwell, said. The community is planning action against El Mundo after the daily paper published a column by 83-year-old playwright Antonio Gala questioning Jews&apos; ability to live peacefully with others: &quot;It&apos;s not strange they have been so frequently expelled.&quot; Studies suggest antisemitism may indeed be mounting. A 2012 survey by the EU&apos;s by the Fundamental Rights agency of some 6,000 Jews in eight European countries \u2013 between them, home to 90% of Europe&apos;s Jewish population \u2013 found 66% of respondents felt antisemitism in Europe was on the rise; 76% said antisemitism had increased in their country over the past five years. In the 12 months after the survey, nearly half said they worried about being verbally insulted or attacked in public because they were Jewish. Jewish organisations that record antisemitic incidents say the trend is inexorable: France&apos;s Society for the Protection of the Jewish Community says annual totals of antisemitic acts in the 2000s are seven times higher than in the 1990s. French Jews are leaving for Israel in greater numbers, too, for reasons they say include antisemitism and the electoral success of the hard-right Front National. The Jewish Agency for Israel said 3,288 French Jews left for Israel in 2013, a 72% rise on the previous year. Between January and May this year, 2,254 left, against 580 in the same period last year. In a study completed in February, America&apos;s Anti-Defamation League surveyed 332,000 Europeans using an index of 11 questions designed to reveal strength of anti-Jewish stereotypes. It found that 24% of Europeans \u2013 37% in France, 27% in Germany, 20% in Italy \u2013 harboured some kind of anti-Jewish attitude. So what is driving the phenomenon? Valls, the French prime minister, has acknowledged a &quot;new&quot;, &quot;normalised&quot; antisemitism that he says blends &quot;the Palestinian cause, jihadism, the devastation of Israel, and hatred of France and its values&quot;. Mark Gardner of the Community Security Trust, a London-based charity that monitors antisemitism both in Britain and on the continent, also identifies a range of factors. Successive conflicts in the Middle East he said, have served up &quot;a crush of trigger events&quot; that has prevented tempers from cooling: the second intifada in 2000, the Israel-Lebanon war of 2006, and the three Israel\u2013Hamas conflicts in 2009, 2012 and 2014 have &quot;left no time for the situation to return to normal.&quot; In such a climate, he added, three brutal antisemitic murders in the past eight years \u2013 two in France, one in Belgium, and none coinciding with Israeli military action \u2013 have served &quot;not to shock, but to encourage the antisemites&quot;, leaving them &quot;seeking more blood and intimidation, not less&quot;.     Experts said anti-Jewish attacks were not only down to Israel-Palestinian conflict. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images    In 2006, 23-year old Ilan Halimi was kidnapped, tortured and left for dead in Paris by a group calling itself the Barbarians Gang, who subsequently admitted targeting him &quot;because he was a Jew, so his family would have money&quot;. Two years ago, in May 2012, Toulouse gunman Mohamed Merah shot dead seven people, including three children and a young rabbi outside their Jewish school. And in May this year Mehdi Nemmouche, a Frenchman of Algerian descent thought to have recently returned to France after a year in Syria fighting with radical Islamists, was charged with shooting four people at the Jewish museum in Brussels. If the French establishment has harboured a deep vein of anti-Jewish sentiment since long before the Dreyfus affair, the influence of radical Islam, many Jewish community leaders say, is plainly a significant contributing factor in the country&apos;s present-day antisemitism. But so too, said Gardner, is a straightforward alienation that many young Muslims feel from society. &quot;Often it&apos;s more to do with that than with Israel. Many would as soon burn down a police station as a synagogue. Jews are simply identified as part of the establishment.&quot; While he stressed it would be wrong to lay all the blame at the feet of Muslims, Peter Ulrich, a research fellow at the centre for antisemitism research (ZfA) at Berlin&apos;s Technical University, agreed that some of the &quot;antisemitic elements&quot; Germany has seen at recent protests could be &quot;a kind of rebellion of people who are themselves excluded on the basis of racist structures.&quot; Arfi said that in France antisemitism had become &quot;a portmanteau for a lot of angry people: radical Muslims, alienated youths from immigrant families, the far right, the far left&quot;. But he also blamed &quot;a process of normalisation, whereby antisemitism is being made somehow acceptable&quot;. One culprit, Arfi said, is the controversial comedian Dieudonn\u00e9: &quot;He has legitimised it. He&apos;s made acceptable what was unacceptable.&quot; A similar normalisation may be under way in Germany, according to a 2013 study by the Technical University of Berlin. In 14,000 hate-mail letters, emails and faxes sent over 10 years to the Israeli embassy in Berlin and the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Professor Monika Schwarz-Friesel found that 60% were written by educated, middle-class Germans, including professors, lawyers, priests and university and secondary school students. Most, too, were unafraid to give their names and addresses \u2013 something she felt few Germans would have done 20 or 30 years ago. Almost every observer pointed to the unparalleled power of unfiltered social media to inflame and to mobilise. A stream of shocking images and Twitter hashtags, including #HitlerWasRight, amount, Arfi said, almost to indoctrination. &quot;The logical conclusion, in fact, is radicalisation: on social media people self-select what they see, and what they see can be pure, unchecked propaganda. They may never be confronted with opinions that are not their own.&quot; Additional reporting by Josie Le Blond in Berlin\u200b, Kim Willsher in Paris, John Hooper in Rome and Ashifa Kassam in Madrid \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 8 August to correct the name of the Madrid Jewish community leader David Hatchwell.

Michelle van der Vliet, founder of Amsterdam food blog Story 154, has tactical advice: \u201cArrive early and head skyward: OpBaut, a grassy first-floor suntrap, has just opened.

Heathrow said July had been its busiest ever month, with just under 7 million passengers travelling through its terminals, an increase of 0.5% on last year. The UK&apos;s largest airport, which proposes to tunnel a 14-lane stretch of the M25 under a new third runway, was boosted by a rise in the number of passengers flying to and from emerging economies including Mexico, China and India. Heathrow&apos;s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said Gatwick could not deliver the extra flights to emerging economies that Britain needs. &quot;Despite other UK airports having spare capacity, only Heathrow can deliver daily, direct flights to emerging economies that will help Britain win in the global race for growth. Gatwick can&apos;t, Heathrow can.&quot; But Gatwick also claimed a record-breaking month, with just over 4 million passengers flying through its airport, an increase of 6% on last year. Gatwick reported a rise in its north Atlantic traffic of 6.6%, following the introduction of low-cost flights to New York by Norwegian Air Shuttle. Gatwick&apos;s chief financial officer Nick Dunn hailed the results as a reason for choosing Gatwick over its rival. &quot;Building a third runway at Heathrow will diminish the choice available to British passengers, making it more expensive to go on holiday, to travel for business and to export goods and services,&quot; he said. The airport said its European destinations were performing strongly, with overall traffic to cities such as Paris, Amsterdam and Rome up 10%. The Sussex-based airport wants to build a second runway and extend capacity at Stansted to break Heathrow&apos;s dominance of the London market. The government&apos;s Airports Commission is due to make its final recommendation on airport expansion after the 2015 election, although no party has pledged to act on its findings.

In Amsterdam it is \u201ckippenvel\u201d. Translation: goosebumps. Van Gaal put his chin up, marched down the tunnel and, when he emerged into the fading light, it was with an expression on his face that suggested he liked the look of his new workplace. They are quickly warming to him, too, judging by the crowd\u2019s acclaim after this slightly eccentric win, and not forgetting the clamour to join in the chain of high fives as he made his way along the touchline early in the second half. David Moyes\u2019s first night as manager at Old Trafford last summer was one to forget, with Sevilla inflicting a 3-1 chasing that turned out to be a sign of things to come. Van Gaal \u2013 who last night confirmed Wayne Rooney will be his captain this season \u2013 has opened his account much more satisfactorily, on top of five straight wins on tour in the US. Too much can be read into these fixtures sometimes but the new manager will have enjoyed Marouane Fellaini\u2019s winner, in what used to be known as Fergie Time. Sir Alex Ferguson liked to say there was no other side in the world who scored more last-minute winners. Moyes did not experience one. Van Gaal has quickly got in on the act \u2013 Fellaini\u2019s shot was the final kick of the night bar the restart \u2013 and there was a delicious irony about the fact it came from a player who had been singled out as the scapegoat from the Moyes era. Fellaini, a second-half substitute, had attracted loud, ironic cheers every time he completed a simple pass. If the feel-good factor is slowly returning to Old Trafford, there was a reminder that Van Gaal is inheriting a club where discontent lingers just beneath the surface. \u201cI cannot change, in three or four weeks, everything,\u201d he said. Yet he did seem relatively happy with what had passed so far. \u201cWe have won every game, which is fantastic when you see our opponents.\u201d Van Gaal certainly sounded like a man who meant business. He also seemed impatient to get started, making his first appearance a full 36 minutes before the kick-off, waving to a mostly deserted Stretford End before striding purposefully across the pitch to observe the warm-up in front of the stand they had named after Ferguson and directly beneath the banner heralding the former manager\u2019s achievements. In other parts of the ground the branding was all about \u201cReunited\u201d as if the real United had been away for some time. MUTV, the club\u2019s in-house television channel, has been running an advert over the summer that tells its own story. It shows the Moyes banner \u2013 \u201cThe Chosen One\u201d \u2013 amid a stormy sky and a Scottish voice sounding close to disgusted. \u201cFootball, bloody hell. What the hell was that all about?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice is next: \u201cI was ashamed of them.\u201d Then the banner, showing the face of Moyes, crumples and another voice comes in. \u201cTrust me, we\u2019ll be back. A new storm is breaking.\u201d United, under Van Gaal, give the impression they would like to airbrush Moyes from their history. It will not be that easy, of course, and there were moments when United\u2019s vulnerability in defence briefly seemed like a throwback to last season. Tom Cleverley was at fault for Rodrigo Moreno\u2019s equaliser, with a hashed clearance into his opponent\u2019s path, and a side that had previously looked ripe to be beaten were suddenly threatening to spoil Van Gaal\u2019s evening. Instead the focus of everyone\u2019s attention was left to congratulate himself on his decision-making \u2013 \u201cIt was about the substitutes,\u201d Van Gaal volunteered \u2013 on an evening when the only real downside for United was the injury bulletin about Luke Shaw, Jonny Evans and Antonio Valencia. All three might miss Saturday\u2019s game against Swansea, at a time when United are already short of defenders. Tyler Blackett played as the left-sided centre-half alongside Phil Jones and Chris Smalling, with Reece James replacing Shaw as the left wing-back in the 3-4-1-2 system that has been Van Gaal\u2019s stamp since arriving from the World Cup. The new formation means Juan Mata can play in his best position, with Rooney pushed further forward, partnered here by Javier Hern\u00e1ndez because Robin van Persie was not fully fit. Fellaini trotted on after 76 minutes and it soon became apparent he might need selective hearing \u2013 but then Blackett sent a long ball into the penalty area. Valencia\u2019s goalkeeper, Diego Alves, got in a tangle with one of his defenders and suddenly Fellaini was rolling the ball into an exposed net and holding up a triumphant fist.", "sentences": ["In Amsterdam it is \u201ckippenvel\u201d."], "title": "Manchester United 2-1 Valencia | Football friendly match report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/12/manchester-united-valencia-friendly-louis-van-gaal", "tags": ["Friendlies", "Manchester United", "Valencia", "Louis van Gaal", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-08-14T07:00:02Z", "article": "I made this in 2013 using a well-trained albino python and a model I&apos;ve worked with for years. Although the model trusted the snake&apos;s trainer completely, it wasn&apos;t easy for her, but she was attracted by the challenge. Throughout the shoot, the trainer was standing by just out of the frame \u2013 ready to stop the whole thing if it went wrong. I think she reached a sort of superior level of meditation, which was good, since I wanted her face to have a very inward-turned expression. That was something she concentrated on, but to\u00a0maintain it when you have a snake\u00a0crawling over you is really admirable. I was keen to avoid any trace of personality, as that might distract from what&apos;s going on. It&apos;s something I aim for whether I&apos;m working in drawing, sculpture or photography. It means that the person can become a vehicle for different ideas. This picture is not really a portrait of a person. It&apos;s about the snake \u2013 it has become the protagonist. The girl is just a pedestal. We spent about 15 minutes making the photograph, which was a long time for the snake. It quickly got to be too much for him: he&apos;s on a strange person with a different smell from what he&apos;s used to, and the trainer is constantly pushing him into a position he doesn&apos;t really want to be in. Snakes won&apos;t lie still, not even for a second, so when you work with them you have to create parameters. What happens within those parameters is down to chance and luck. In this picture, I would say we definitely got lucky \u2013 because the knot is so fantastic. It&apos;s like calligraphy. I was originally planning to make an image of a girl with an owl sitting on her chin. But\u00a0when I was researching where to a get a tame owl from, I stumbled upon a reptile-trainer who sent me a list of his animals. It was inspirational: I ended up with loads of ideas about how I could shoot his reptiles. I sometimes use a bit of traditional iconography in my work. I recently made a photograph of Medusa with baby snakes. They were so beautiful: a cluster of baby snakes, writhing. Most of the photographs from the session with the python are horrible \u2013 but also really funny, because the model&apos;s face is totally distorted. A snake is just a bundle of muscles, so when he was moving across her face, he was squeezing it. That was something I never thought about when I planned the shoot. The model was utterly into the project, but very clear about her boundaries. When she saw the list of animals, she said: &quot;No way crocodiles.&quot; CV Born: Netherlands, 1970.

In current traffic, you can make it between the two in an hour and 59 minutes (real-time updates for your commute from the Mill, and probably the most accurate thing you\u2019ll read in our oeuvre), and it is a curiously well-beaten path. The Tigers already count four United alumni among their number, manager Steve Bruce included, and several more have passed through during the last half-decade\u2019s assiduous combing of Red Devil cast-offs. But with apologies to Robbie Brady, James Chester and Paul McShane, the biggest deal yet is apparently plotting that schlep across the Pennines. Danny Welbeck \u2013 yes Welbz himself \u2013 is the man Hull want to perk up an attack that might soon be losing Shane Long to Southampton, with Brucie hoping a carrot of \u00a314m might entice Louis van Gaal into expediting the much-mooted exodus from M16 that hasn\u2019t really happened yet. Goals have been hard to come by for Welbeck this year \u2013 just the two since 1 January \u2013 but that didn\u2019t stop Bruce from signing Nikica Jelavic and it seems fairly clear that the striker, 24 in November, would fancy strutting his stuff up top each week rather than being shunted out wide to do an Intriguing Tactical Job. So, eyes open for an England forward putting a cross-country shift in sometime soon. And if Welbz doesn\u2019t fancy it? Watford captain Troy Deeney, whose inhabiting of a glorious constantly-linked-but-never-moving space is our very raison d\u2019\u00eatre, is also under the Hull supremo\u2019s scrutiny. Perhaps unlike Welbeck, we\u2019ll stay in Manchester. The Arturo Vidal saga, such as it is, could be over soon \u2013 with suggestions that he could finally pitch up at United with Javier Hern\u00e1ndez lined up in part-exchange. Pinches of salt all round, as per. The trail from Amsterdam to London is similarly log-jammed to the M62 at the best of times and, for different reasons, often equally unmemorable. Kolbeinn Sigthorsson\u2019s lucidity may well be questioned if he seals a move from Ajax to QPR, but the Icelandic front man\u2019s switch looks closer after a hitch involving personal terms was negotiated. Nervous glances, meanwhile, at nearby Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea will have to shift another of their foreign players in order to comply with rules regarding Premier League and Champions League squads. Who could it be? Petr Cech, Marco van Ginkel, Mikel John Obi and Fernando Torres may all be wary of finding a horse\u2019s head in their locker between now and the end of the month if they sit too comfortably. Arsenal seem fairly relaxed about their attacking options now that Alexis S\u00e1nchez is in the fold and Yaya Sanogo is battering them past Benfica. They\u2019re willing to let young German winger Serge Gnabry, who scored at Swansea in last season\u2019s Premier League, head out on loan for some more sustained top-level experience \u2013 with Aston Villa among those keen for their own infusion of Teutonic excellence. With a section of Swansea\u2019s squad seemingly having decided the intensity and passion of the Qatari league is more their thing than the Premier League\u2019s barren, sterile eeriness, Garry Monk has a vacancy or two to fill \u2013 particularly at centre-back. No matter, because Argentinian centre-back Federico Fern\u00e1ndez is on his way from Napoli, from whose Champions League squad he has been omitted, and should sign for around \u00a37m by the end of the week. Finally, relief at Newcastle \u2013 where Tim Krul has skilfully knocked down a straw man by confiding in team-mates he is happy to stay at St James\u2019 Park after being impressed by the signings of countrymen Siem de Jong and Daryl Janmaat.

At heart, though, I&apos;m a nester. I&apos;d like to settle down. So we&apos;re thinking that we&apos;ll choose just three countries to live in.&quot; Cantwell isn&apos;t a trustafarian or a lottery winner, she works for a living. Her business, Free Range Humans, is about helping other people to become &quot;location independent&quot;, so they can live and work just about anywhere. It may be a secret dream for lots of us \u2013 or not so secret, perhaps, after a holiday in an idyllic location, but how realistic is it? Are Cantwell and her tribe of nomadic workers the lucky ones, or is this an indication of what work will look like for more of us in the future? Statistics indicate it might be. One study of more than 45,000 UK businesses revealed a 68% rise in the number who had employed remote workers in the last 12 months. &quot;Ask anyone where they go when they really need to get something done and they almost never say the office,&quot; says Jason Fried, co-author of Remote: Office Not Required. He is CEO of Basecamp, a company that operates a remote working policy for its 45 or so employees, because he believes in hiring the right talent, wherever they are in the world. His view is that remote working is not about providing a perk for employees, it&apos;s about increasing productivity. The reality may be that not many of us make it to the beaches of Ko Tao or Canc\u00fan to run our global empire, but we will, Fried believes, spend at least a couple of days in every week working from home, or even at the coffee shop round the corner. But perhaps that&apos;s as much freedom as some of us can cope with. &quot;It&apos;s the weirdest thing, to be able to be anywhere, and I don&apos;t think anything can prepare you for that feeling,&quot; Cantwell says. &quot;The world is pretty big.&quot; Phuket, Thailand     Lea Woodward: 'It can be a lonely life, particularly if you\u2019re introverts, like we are, but having kids makes it\u00a0easier, as you get plugged into the community.' Photograph: Luke Duggleby for the Guardian    Lea Woodward is the founder of the Trivas Foundation, an online business school, and co-founder of an illustrators&apos; resource with her husband, Jonathan. They have two children.  I grew up travelling. My parents divorced when I was young and we moved to the UK with my mother. From the age of five I would fly unaccompanied with my brother to Hong Kong to see my father. When Jonathan and I took the decision to go freelance, it made sense to try living somewhere else in the world, so we could maintain our standard of living while the businesses grew. I was already doing a lot of work with clients over the phone, and Jonathan was used to working remotely, so we set ourselves a target number of clients to secure before we set off, which took about six months. I literally Googled things like &quot;great quality of life, low cost living&quot;. At that time, the place that kept being mentioned was Panama, so we rented out the house and booked our tickets. I don&apos;t think we even knew they spoke Spanish. We stayed for a couple of months but decided it wasn&apos;t for us, so from there we went to Buenos Aires, then Toronto, Grenada, South Africa, Turkey. We always aimed to stay for around three months, but it was often less. It wasn&apos;t the best planned itinerary. We were in Cape Town when we found out I was pregnant; we decided it would be more practical to come back to the UK. Then when Mali was four months old we took her to Dubai. Now, we also have Samson, who&apos;s one, and this has been his first big trip. We plan to home educate them. The ideal is to have two or three places in the world that we shuttle round every year. I do the lion&apos;s share of earning while Jonathan has more responsibility for the kids. Unless there&apos;s something urgent, we spend the afternoons together as a family. It can be a lonely life, particularly if you&apos;re introverts, like we are, but having kids makes it\u00a0easier, as you get plugged into the community. If Mali said she wanted to stay put then we&apos;d try it, but for now she loves moving around.

She lives in the Dordogne with her\u00a0husband, Nick, and their three\u00a0children. We aren&apos;t great risk-takers. We knew, having lived in Paris for years, that we wanted to live in the country but it was a question of how to make money. You see English people who have come down here without knowing how they&apos;ll make a living and that terrifies me. I&apos;d become good friends with the editorial director at my old company so when she set up this new agency, I went with her; that was 15 years ago. I am the only one who isn&apos;t French. Once every two months or so, we meet up for a board meeting in a restaurant and go through everything over lunch. I go to Paris every fortnight or so for a day of client meetings. Nick is a teacher and works in Paris three days a\u00a0week, but he gets nice long holidays. My days are a seamless mix of work and home. I&apos;ll go for a run, have a good breakfast. I have a desk in the living room, and the family know not to interrupt. Quite often I&apos;ll be cooking something at the same time I&apos;m working or in the summer I might take the kids to the river for a swim. The important thing is that the company know they can get hold of me whenever they want me. I\u00a0only bill them for the time I&apos;ve worked, so I never have to feel guilty about doing other things. There are a few downsides, but they are piddling. Sometimes, we stop and look around at everything we have and it can still make us laugh out loud. Mexico     Giacomo Conti: 'I realised I could do my job here \u2013 or pretty much anywhere.' Photograph: Adam Wiseman for the Guardian    Giacomo Conti owns DJ management company Clandestine Artists. He is based in Todos Santos. I&apos;ve been living out of my suitcase for two years. When I left the agency I was working for in New York to start out on my own, I moved to Berlin because that&apos;s where a lot of\u00a0my artists were based. Then, while I was in Mexico with my girlfriend, we split up. She went back to Berlin, but the winter was coming so I decided to stay here with a friend. I realised that, actually, I could do my job here \u2013 or pretty much anywhere. I stayed for the season then went back to Europe for the summer, then I went to Brazil, then back to Mexico, then to Indonesia. Where I end up depends on all kinds of things. I might need to show up at a festival for work, or I\u00a0might head somewhere for the surf, or to see friends. Right now, I&apos;m hoping to get a\u00a0short let on the place I&apos;m in. I\u00a0have\u00a0two new employees, one from\u00a0Barcelona, one in LA, and they are both relocating here. They&apos;re pretty willing to do it, and are very excited to be able to work from such a place. Last year, one of my employees brought her boyfriend and twin brother with her, and they\u00a0loved it. I put in my face time by touring with my artists, heading to most of\u00a0the festivals, and spend a long time away from home, working. Most of my artists work around the world every weekend, so we all congregate a few times a year around major festivals like BPM (Mexico), ADE (Amsterdam), WMC (Miami), or Ibiza in the summer. Then I come back home to put in all\u00a0the office hours, and balance life on the road with a much healthier way of living. When I&apos;m here I get a lot more done. I&apos;m not partying all the time. A lot of my friends are globetrotters so if I don&apos;t see them when I&apos;m travelling, they&apos;ll come and see me. I don&apos;t get lonely. My\u00a0house was full for the whole of\u00a0February. Working this way is very personal, you learn a lot about yourself, and what you really need. Living in a way that&apos;s a bit more secluded, more thoughtful, has made me feel more at peace, a lot more productive, and, I guess, a better person.

It was Ali who said, &quot;Come on, if we don&apos;t do this now, we&apos;ll regret it.&quot; We&apos;d had a holiday house here, we could see that the international school would be a great fit for our son Rufus, and our daughter Tallulah was settled in her boarding school, so the timing felt right. I had been a partner in a financial research firm for about 20 years. Then the company was sold and all of a sudden, that just stopped. It gave me the opportunity to think about what I really wanted to do, but it was also quite a tricky adjustment. When a friend came to me with his idea for Disciple Media, I helped him raise money to get it off the ground and stayed on to run the commercial side. There are seven of us now, soon to be 12, so it&apos;s going well. I&apos;m in London for seven or eight days a month then follow up on everything else from here. I&apos;ve got an office that&apos;s away from the house, but in summer, without wishing to sound smug, I find myself by the pool with the laptop. The reality, though, is that you have to be disciplined. We&apos;re supposed to be going home in six months, but that&apos;s going to be an incredibly difficult sell for the rest of the family. I really don&apos;t want to spend most of my time in the UK any more. Biarritz     Mhairi Hughes: 'We have an office in Scotland.

This is a family business: my parents, who are based in Scotland, set it up, then I joined in 2007. Before that, I worked in London in recruitment. Our community manager is also here but we have an office in Scotland. When we&apos;re at our desks we&apos;re in constant contact through instant messaging and Skype, it&apos;s like we&apos;re sitting across from each other in an office. Usually, I go for a run with my dog or a surf before breakfast, and am at my desk by 9am. I&apos;ve converted a shed in the garden. If the surf&apos;s good, I&apos;ll go out in the afternoon then work till 6pm or 7pm. If one of us is going to do that, we always let the others know; we&apos;re friends so we don&apos;t leave each other in the lurch. I met my partner here and he runs his own business, so we both understand what it&apos;s like to work unconventional hours. This feels like home now. My dad was in the military so I grew up on the move. There was always a subconscious clock, I think, wanting to know &quot;when&apos;s the next adventure?&quot; but since I&apos;ve been here, I haven&apos;t felt that at all.

She and her partner Paul spend half the year in London, and their winters in different locations. They run the volunteering website globalhelpswap.com. We started travelling four years ago. Paul and I had been saving for a deposit on a house, but we had always dreamed of travelling and I was very unhappy in my job at the time, so one day we asked ourselves the question, &quot;Do we buy a house or go and see the world?&quot; Travelling won.  We didn&apos;t really work in that first year, but we spent a lot of time planting the seeds for the businesses we now run. We live in London for six or seven months of the year, then spend winters travelling. This year, we were going to go to Costa Rica but after talking to some of our other blogging friends we thought we&apos;d give Mexico a try. The town we&apos;re in now is called San Franciso but known locally as San Pancho. It&apos;s not much more than one road and a really, really beautiful beach. Wherever we are, we try to create a routine for work. We usually walk to the beach every morning and meditate, then I&apos;ll spend the time until lunch either in a coaching session or writing my coaching courses. I do all of my coaching virtually, either online or via Skype, even when I&apos;m in London, so it isn&apos;t a big adjustment for the people I&apos;m working with. I&apos;m currently coaching people in Argentina, the UK and India, and it can be a bit tricky dealing with all the different time zones; I&apos;m about to hire an assistant to help me out. We break for lunch around 1pm, and then the afternoons are ours. A couple of afternoons a week we volunteer at Entre Amigos, a local community centre for children. We love to volunteer wherever we go as it&apos;s a great way to give back to the community and form friendships. The highlight of the day is sunset.

Led by the eponymous founding Sonic Youth guitarist, and drummer Steve Shelley, the band also features My Bloody Valentine bass player Deb Googe and James Sedwards of N\u00f8ught on a second guitar. The band is a return to more slightly more conventional rock for Moore, who has been playing regular experimental gigs at Oto in recent years with various luminaries from the improv scene including Caspar Br\u00f6tzmann, John Edwards and Adam Golebiewski. By email, Thurston Moore explained to the Guardian how what was meant to be a rehearsal became the first gig of the band\u2019s tour: \u201cSteve Shelley flew into London to rehearse for our purported first gig at Pukkelpop festival in Belgium today (Friday) and we were having tea and crumpets at Caf\u00e9 Oto Tuesday afternoon when we noticed they had nothing booked that week. We asked if we could set up and rehearse on Thursday to whomever may be lingering and Oto said sure.          Positive feedback     \u201cWe then thought we\u2019d just invite some friends. Then we thought well let\u2019s announce it day-of and have some fans dig our \u2018rehearsal\u2019. Well, word got out and it became a straight-up rock\u2019n\u2019roll party and we plugged in and played every note we knew (so far) \u2013 all new songs, from the new album, The Best Day. \u201cSuper Duper fun time with James Sedwards of Stoke Newington ripping wild guitar action and Deb Googe showing who is most definitely boss on the bass. And of course Steve and Thurston in stratospheric sonic form. Nice time, wish you were there. Next time? Say yes!\u201d The venue generally has its avant garde performers play a number of sets over an evening. Rather than doing that, the band simply played all the new songs once, and then again after an interval. Some of the songs can be heard online, streaming via Dalston web radio station NTS. The Best Day will be released by Matador Records on 21 October.

It was as a player of the recorder and baroque flute that he made his reputation, winning accolades for his astonishing variety of tone colour, rhythmic flexibility and the sheer brilliance of his technique. At the age of 21 he was appointed professor at the Royal Conservatory in the Hague, later holding the position of Erasmus professor at Harvard University. As a close associate of the harpsichordist Gustav Leonhardt, he appeared as a recorder player on more than 50 releases on Telefunken&apos;s Das Alte Werk label. But in 1981 he entered a new phase in this career when he founded the period-instrument Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century, remaining in charge of them for the rest of his life, exploring repertoire that ranged from Bach and Rameau through Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to Schubert and Mendelssohn. Like many other period-instrument specialists, he subsequently brought historical principles to bear in his work with modern-instrument orchestras such as the Chicago Symphony, the Royal Concertgebouw and the Vienna Philharmonic. Born in Amsterdam, he studied the recorder with Kees Otten, the flute at the Amsterdam Muzieklyceum and musicology at Amsterdam University. His virtuoso technique on the recorder propelled him to celebrity status, with something of a cult following. With his long legs nonchalantly crossed, he would hold the instrument to his mouth at an implausible angle, and \u2013 as his colleague Joel Cohen recalled \u2013 coax from it nuances and shadings that few would have imagined possible: &quot;The little whistle heaved and sighed like a wood nymph in the embrace of some ardent faun.&quot; Notes would be slightly bent in slow passages to exquisitely yearning effect. The tone would be alternately warmed and cooled, and pinpoint articulation and bold use of rubato deployed to expressive effect. In the late 1960s, his recording company, Telefunken, seized the potential of his exceptional technique, allied to his heavy-lidded but boyish good looks, to produce a poster of their star performer for distribution with his long-playing albums. Many a bedroom wall was adorned with it. If at first his inflections and messa di voce swellings (&quot;placing the voice&quot;, with the dynamics on a single note rising and falling) seemed mannered, it is a tribute to his persuasive musicianship that such gestures became widely accepted. Controversial as his playing was at the time, Br\u00fcggen was able to defend his practice with detailed reference to 17th- and 18th-century performance treatises. No less idiosyncratic was his involvement with the Dutch counterculture movement at this time. In 1972 he founded with Kees Boeke and Walter van Hauwe an avant-garde recorder trio called Sour Cream. The concluding piece of one of their Boston concerts featured a Keystone Kops-style chase around the stage. A year or two later, with the ensemble playing Telemann trios again in Boston, Br\u00fcggen wandered on to the stage, donned a pair of dark sunglasses, stretched himself out on a chaise longue and proceeded to read the newspaper. The Boston Globe was satisfyingly outraged. In 1993 the founder members of Sour Cream returned to the recording studio with a programme called The Passion of Reason, which made a journey through music with a scientific slant, influenced by the concept of the medieval quadrivium \u2013 the convergence of music, arithmetic, astronomy and geometry. Br\u00fcggen also commissioned a number of works for recorder, among them Luciano Berio&apos;s Gesti (1965), which he dispatched in appropriately theatrical style. Br\u00fcggen&apos;s work with the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century was in general less marked by controversy, in part because the world had moved on. The members of this 65-strong ensemble, about a third of whom were Dutch, shared equally in the proceeds of concerts. &quot;I earn the same as the second clarinet,&quot; Br\u00fcggen once said. Compared with the bracing readings of classical repertoire by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, for example, Br\u00fcggen&apos;s were less extreme and could never be accused of attention-seeking. His subtly nuanced lines, relaxed tempi and lilting phrases were admirably suited to Haydn and Mozart. His Beethoven interpretations, though they exploited the acerbic timbres of period instruments, were for some tastes too solid and conventional. His Bach, for example the notable Mass in B minor for Philips (1990), was characterised by its rhythmic vigour, its honesty and integrity, the shape of each movement unfolding with seeming inevitability. Br\u00fcggen continued to conduct even when his health deteriorated in the latter years. By the time of a performance of music from Rameau&apos;s Les Bor\u00e9ades at the final event of a residency for his orchestra at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague last May he was using a wheelchair and a nasogastric tube. But he still drew playing of extraordinary spiritual intensity. He is survived by his wife, the art historian Machtelt Isra\u00ebls, and their daughters, Zephyr and Eos. \u2022 Frans Br\u00fcggen, recorder player and conductor, born 30 October 1934; died 13 August 2014", "sentences": ["Born in Amsterdam, he studied the recorder with Kees Otten, the flute at the Amsterdam Muzieklyceum and musicology at Amsterdam University."], "title": "Frans Br\u00fcggen obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/17/frans-bruggen", "tags": ["Classical music", "Culture", "Music", "Netherlands", "Conducting"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-08-18T07:00:00Z", "article": "A work trip, and I&apos;ve been booked into a motel somewhere in the middle of England&apos;s flattest county. The rooms are built around the car park, while the centre of operations is a Tudorbethan pub that smells vaguely of Britvic orange and thwarted ambition. It&apos;s one of those places, small-minded and slightly sinister, that makes the single traveller \u2013 especially the single female traveller \u2013 feel more than usually alone, and when the man at the front desk asks if I would like to make a dinner reservation in what I shall call the Geoffrey Chaucer Carvery, I lose my nerve, for all that I&apos;m hungry, have no transport of my own, and know very well there&apos;s nowhere else to eat within easy walking distance. &quot;No, I&apos;m fine, thank you,&quot; I tell him. I then repair to my cabin to eat the biscuits on my tea tray. Dawn arrives, and I lie awake listening both to the rumble of the road and of my stomach. Two hours later, I break cover, and head for breakfast. &quot;Just yourself, is it?&quot; says the ma\u00eetre d&apos;, an oleaginous smile smeared across his face like cheap jam. There&apos;s something about this question \u2013 the graceless, unkind way it is framed; the hint of snideness in the word &quot;yourself&quot; \u2013 that makes me shrink inwardly. But if this chap notices my embarrassment, he gives no sign. He simply turns on his heel and leads me rather briskly to my table. Perhaps you know what&apos;s coming next. In this situation, there are only two possible outcomes. Either I will be stuck in a corridor close to a flapping kitchen door, friendless and forgotten. Or I will be carefully placed, in the manner of the class dunce, bang smack in the middle of the room, the better to take in all the couples, families and wedding parties. Either way, my breakfast, however hearty, will feel more like an admonishment than a treat. I loiter for a moment, wondering which it is to be today. Oh, right. It&apos;s the latter. Hello, everyone! Yes, do have a good gander. This sunny Sunday morning, I am very much going solo. I&apos;ve lost count of the number of occasions I&apos;ve had a miserable time eating alone. So I was consoled \u2013 though only mildly \u2013 by a recent report which noted that, elsewhere, restaurants are finally waking up to the fact that they must be more welcoming to single diners, this demographic now being too economically powerful to ignore. A restaurateur in Ottawa, Stephen Beckta, told a journalist from the BBC that single diners &quot;are the greatest compliment a restaurant can receive&quot; and in order to accommodate them, he has instituted all kinds of loving practices, from instructing his staff to ask customers where they would prefer to sit, to offering a free lunch to those who book for two only to find they&apos;ve been stood up (he doesn&apos;t advertise this, but he also trusts people not to take advantage). In Amsterdam, meanwhile, a pop-up called Eenmaal which caters only for tables for one has been so successful that its owner, Marina van Goor, now plans on opening branches in Antwerp, New York, Berlin and, yes, London. I hope Ms van Goor has a hit here and perhaps, in time, in Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow, too. But I fear we&apos;ve a long way to go before we make eating out alone as painless as it is abroad (I never feel remotely self-conscious in the US). For change to happen, prissy ma\u00eetre d&apos;s everywhere are going to have to learn that working in the hospitality industry involves \u2013 just imagine it! \u2013 being hospitable, even to those whose bills might be on the small side. It should be obvious, but let me say it anyway: no one who&apos;s dining alone wants to be put next to a party of eight who are loudly celebrating a birthday. Proprietors are also going to have to start thinking very differently about their rooms. A wide, comfortable bar as standard would be a start: when I&apos;m alone I like to eat on a high stool, and doubtless this is cost-effective for the restaurant, too, space being at a premium. But they also need to ponder such factors as lighting. I want to be able to read at my table. I don&apos;t want to spend my evening staring mournfully out into the gloom. Waiters, of course, are going to have to become vastly more empathetic, learning to work out which single diners would like them to strike up a conversation, and which would not (I would prefer to be treated the same way as everyone else). Such relatively simple things, and yet what a difference their institution would make to those of us currently destined to spend long and rather desperate evenings eating dusty shortbread in places like Ye Olde Churle.", "sentences": ["In Amsterdam, meanwhile, a pop-up called Eenmaal which caters only for tables for one has been so successful that its owner, Marina van Goor, now plans on opening branches in Antwerp, New York, Berlin and, yes, London."], "title": "The perils of a table for one", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/18/perils-of-a-table-for-one-rachel-cooke-dining-alone", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style", "Social trends", "Society"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-08-18T07:15:11Z", "article": "1. Camille O\u2019Sullivan singing Look Mummy, No Hands The Nick Cave covers in Camille\u2019s 10th-anniversary show are sublime but the show-stopping moment comes when she performs Dillie Keane and Adele Anderson\u2019s tearjerker, which must be one of the best songs ever written. It\u2019s a sort of merry-go-round of motherhood which starts with a young girl\u2019s joyful carousel ride, skips to her teenage years spent battling her mum over curfews, and concludes with the girl all grown-up, and a parent herself, raising a child alone. One of Camille\u2019s earlier Edinburgh shows was called Chameleon and here she clowns to Tom Waits and struts to Kirsty MacColl while the band has a ball. But Look Mummy, accompanied solely by Feargal Murray on the piano, is stark, melancholic and desperately moving. I doubt there\u2019s a more emotional six minutes on the fringe. Oh \u2013 and at the end? She goes headfirst into Trent Reznor\u2019s devastating Hurt...            2. When KlangHaus becomes a full-on gig I\u2019d been in and out of the elevator, walked through the tunnel and nosed around a good two or three rooms in Summerhall\u2019s small-animal hospital before KlangHaus got its hooks into me. I liked the flock of cutout birds, the cacophony of electronica and the arty projections on the walls but felt I\u2019d seen it all before. And then... we\u2019re being led by a pair of two-tone-clad troubadours into a tiny room and serenaded with a sweet and folksy tune about reeling \u2019em in and rolling \u2019em out. And then... we find ourselves in another room where a full-blown gig, complete with pulverised drums, erupts around us us and it\u2019s very loud, very addictive and impossible not to move. This is one of those Edinburgh shows where an hour simply is not enough. The band are the Neutrinos and I can\u2019t wait to see them again. 3. Alex Horne completes his contraption What I loved about KlangHaus was the care and delight with which the show has been constructed. The joy of Alex Horne\u2019s solo standup hour, Monsieur Butterfly, is in watching the art of heartfelt construction as it happens. It\u2019s another show that sneaks up on you. Horne blusters on to the stage seemingly without a minute to spare and before long has a volunteer helping him put together a massive Mousetrap-style contraption. His busy-busy persona and the complicated task at hand \u2013 involving grains of rice, a toy squirrel and a traffic cone \u2013 means that the words become a sort of sideshow. But in the closing minutes it\u2019s clear that the script \u2013 of course! \u2013 has been put together with similarly loving detail and the contraption emerges as a hugely moving tribute to parenthood. It gave me goosebumps even before the thrilling finale in which the machine is tested. 4. Ontroerend Goed\u2019s barrage of bad jokes Six women standing on stage clutching imaginary penises and simulating furious masturbation was pretty memorable (even without the porn-film backdrop). So was the moment when those women recited a shared list of \u201cskanks\u201d through the ages (from Mother Teresa to \u201cthat one in The Notebook\u201d). Belgian company Ontroerend Goed\u2019s striking Sirens features several such lists, including the names (and eye-watering prices) of various futuristic-sounding beauty products. This is a tremendously even-handed piece which holds women themselves to account as well as men, but the moment that hits the hardest is when Karolien De Bleser, standing solemnly with the occasional flicker of a wry smile, breathlessly reels off a list of bar-room jokes whose punchlines mostly revolve around women being ugly, stupid, useless or all three. The overall effect is a bit like Bernard Manning meets Bridget Christie.            5. Circa\u2019s duet with a sheet of paper Beyond is a physical theatre show from the ever-inventive Circa which includes a man punishing himself with elastic-band braces, a three-person tower formed to Sinatra\u2019s New York, New York and an astonishing mid-air routine accompanied by Bonnie Tyler\u2019s Total Eclipse of the Heart. The feats of human endurance are such that the man next to me grimly concluded \u201cI need to go to the gym more\u201d on the way out. I\u2019m well aware that it sounds like a cringe-tastic fringe cliche but the moment I won\u2019t forget is one man slow-dancing alone at the front of the stage, as Jacques Brel\u2019s Amsterdam plays, keeping a sheet of paper attached to the gliding palm of his hand. For once the oohs! and the aahs! died down to leave the room in silence.

It was November and I had recently started primary school. All of a sudden, there was a loud banging on the door. I remember looking around and seeing the terror on the other children\u2019s faces when the doors flew open and several grown men stormed into the hall with their faces completely \u201cblacked up\u201d. The terror soon made way for joy when the men starting throwing candy around, but I was left in total confusion. These grown men with blacked-up faces, afros and big red lips were talking to me in broken Dutch and trying to make me smile by prancing around like a clown. I remember wondering why they were trying to look like my father, and why they were acting so silly. My father was a smart man, a grown-up. These grown men in blackface were acting like misbehaving children. It became even more confusing when St Nicholas himself entered. The tall, old, white man dressed like the pope was treated with the utmost respect by my teachers, who had been laughing at the blacked-up men that they referred to as Zwarte Pieten \u2013 Black Petes. As soon as St Nicholas entered, the Black Petes calmed down and silently followed his orders. I couldn\u2019t understand the strange power that St Nicholas had over these grown men who had moments before seemed uncontrollable. At that moment, I remember a creeping feeling that something about this was wrong. I knew that Black Pete\u2019s behaviour was wrong and I knew the way St Nicholas was treating Black Pete was wrong, but I did not understand why. I looked around and saw the smiles of the other children and teachers, and thought the only explanation must be that I was the one who was wrong. From that moment onwards, I never thought to question Black Pete again. The acceptance and enjoyment of the tradition became a measure for how Dutch I was, and since Dutch culture was the only culture I knew, I was petrified to be excluded from it. Last week, Amsterdam\u2019s mayor made a statement that finally validated my creeping feeling by proposing a change of image for Black Pete. The proposed makeover follows a local court ruling that the depiction of Black Pete is, in fact, racist. The court determined that the character was \u201ca negative stereotype of black people\u201d. Soon after, the council of Amsterdam filed an appeal against the verdict arguing that the stereotype of Black Pete wasn\u2019t negative. I grew up in a middle-class environment in The Hague where I could count all the people of colour on one hand. Racism was never that overt; perhaps because there weren\u2019t that many of us, so we were not considered a threat. If any negative stereotyping occurred in my presence, it was always quickly followed by \u201cbut you\u2019re different\u201d. As a child, I was never sure if I should speak out against the negative stereotypes of black people being lazy, dirty or dumb because I was still afraid of being excluded. My silence came hand in hand with a pang of guilt for not sticking up for my own. And then there were the seemingly positive stereotypes about black people being better at singing, dancing or sports, the example often being the black players in our national football team. I remember feeling proud when such remarks were made by white folks because that meant we had worth. What I did not yet understand was that a positive or romanticised stereotype strips a person of their humanity by denying them individuality in the same way that a negative one does. As noted by policy officer Izalina Tavares, all the Black Petes have the same name, the same face and the same characteristics. They are interchangeable. If I, as a person of colour, had to be taught that positive stereotypes are just as dehumanising as negative ones, and therefore racist, it is not surprising that a vast majority of Dutch people truly believe that there is nothing racist about Black Pete. He is loved by young and old, he\u2019s funny, he\u2019s giving, he\u2019s athletic. Wouldn\u2019t anyone want to be associated with these traits? And yes, he can be childish, silly, and even a bit thick at times but we love him in spite of this, so no harm done, right? Wrong. As artist Bianca Berends has written, research shows that stereotypes contribute to low self-esteem in children of colour and perpetuates the idea of white culture being superior to black culture, which in a multicultural environment will undeniably affect society as a whole. The main problem is a lack of education on Dutch slavery and colonialism. I was taught in great detail the atrocities that were committed in the British empire, how the Americans dehumanised their African slaves and how racism in Germany led to the Holocaust. Never did we have one history lesson teaching us about the severity of Dutch conduct in Surinam, the Dutch Caribbean, Indonesia or South Africa. Perhaps if this schooling was there, Dutch people would find it easier to connect Black Pete with our history of slavery and racism. The legacy of slavery and colonialism has preserved structural racism, so for many people of colour it is impossible to disconnect Black Pete from this legacy. Black Pete is a symbol of this legacy and as long as a post-racial society is still a utopian idea, the opposition of Black Pete is completely legitimised.", "sentences": ["Last week, Amsterdam\u2019s mayor made a statement that finally validated my creeping feeling by proposing a change of image for Black Pete.", "Soon after, the council of Amsterdam filed an appeal against the verdict arguing that the stereotype of Black Pete wasn\u2019t negative."], "title": "Black Pete is just a bit of fun for the Netherlands, right?

All the ideas I had been researching and writing about were coming together like the pieces of a puzzle, but I kept wanting to re-explain everything in great detail in every chapter, and sometimes even within a chapter. The word count was growing every day, but my arguments and conclusions weren\u2019t necessarily getting any clearer. I asked a colleague to look at one chapter in particular for me, and the feedback she gave me was gold: write in your own voice. I was writing from fear There is a tension inherent in writing a PhD. On the one hand, it is an examination of your ability to undertake research independently, and write as an academic. On the other, you have to show you have read all the literature in your field, and can cite the most authoritative scholars. The temptation was to spend a lot of words proving that I knew my stuff, that I could rehearse the arguments of those authoritative scholars. But in fact I was writing from fear: a fear of needing to back up every claim and argument with the voice of a well-known scholar \u2013 or preferably several. If someone had said it before, then it was safe to say it myself. But what I was creating was more like an extensive, impressive research report, rather than a thesis of my own. The word \u201cthesis\u201d comes from the Greek tithenai, which literally means \u201cto place\u201d or \u201cto position\u201d: my thesis is my position, my point of view, my stance on a certain issue. If I am not able to convey what that is in my writing, then I am no longer writing my own thesis, I am writing the theses of the giants who have gone before me without adding anything to them. Confidence is essential Particularly in fields such as law, the humanities and some of the social sciences, where research is not necessarily a matter of gathering data or conducting experiments, but rather of gathering positions, and conducting thought experiments, it can be harder to make a distinction between our use of existing knowledge and our own original contribution that builds on that knowledge. Without sufficient research or evidence, the claims and arguments we make may come across as na\u00efve or ill-founded. Yet without the confidence to step out beyond the safety of endless footnotes and the words and voices of big-name scholars, we risk not reaching the level of academic independence that doing a PhD requires of us. The great challenge in the final phase of a project that has consumed my thinking for the past few years is: how do I find my own voice in all of it? How do I find the academic self-confidence to really give a voice to my own thesis, my own position and stance? And indeed, how did the giants of my field become the authoritative voices that we all cite? By developing their own voice. To defend our claims, we have to find our own voice Somehow translating this to my own academic writing proved to be just as much of a challenge. The moment at which we are asked to defend our thesis in front of a committee of professors, to defend our arguments and claims, is the moment at which we literally must find our voice and express it confidently. The award of the doctorate degree, and the title Dr, is a symbolic recognition of our full membership in the academic community. In order to rise to that challenge, it is necessary to find your voice in your writing, to formulate your own position, your own thesis, which you are capable of \u2013 and confident in \u2013 defending. My colleague had given me the key to a door that opened before me in the last throes of writing and editing. These final weeks have become really enjoyable, even with the pressure of the final deadline getting closer and closer, because I have given myself full permission to articulate my own thesis, my own position, my own voice. And the final result is a manuscript that is truly mine, and a piece I feel worthy of submitting as I ask for admission into the academic community as a fully-fledged, independent member.

The four-hour Sky Sports football marathon is ostensibly a live three-hander between Neville, fellow pundit Jamie Carragher and the presenter Ed Chamberlin, backed by a 30-strong on-site support staff. Over the course of several hours watching them plan, rehearse and broadcast, it becomes abundantly clear that Neville is something of a control freak whose enthusiasm and quest for perfection borders on the endearingly psychotic. If everybody was as fastidious about their work as Neville, the world would be a far more efficient place. Quite what the MNF producer Scott Melvin and the director Duncan East, whose job it is to control this control-freakery, make of this is unclear. Consummate pros, they seem content to let the former Manchester United full-back\u2019s remit extend to floor-managing, cue-delivery, stage direction and assorted other aspects of the production process and merely roll their eyes good-humouredly at the occasional mini bouts of petulance that ensue when things do not go his way. Jack Hazzard, the clips guy: \u201cWe can\u2019t change the order of the clips, Gary. Not now.\u201d Gary Neville: \u201cBut you\u2019ve got half an hour.\u201d Jack: [Sighs] \u201cWe\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d Neville\u2019s perfectionism is matched by that of Carragher, who seems equally determined to get things just so, albeit in a more relaxed fashion. In afternoon rehearsals for their season debut \u2013 four hours of detailed analysis interrupted by a match between Chelsea and Burnley \u2013 the pair stand at their respective video plinths, sonic screwdrivers in hand, refining a discussion on the excruciating minutiae of wing-back play that began via a series of text messages the previous Saturday afternoon. The five-man defences deployed by Manchester United, QPR and Hull last weekend are being discussed and the veteran Clint Hill is one of few players under the microscope to emerge with anything resembling credit. Neville bemoans the paucity of decent left-sided centre-backs in the transfer market. Neville: \u201cName two or three left-sided centre-backs Manchester United can try to get.\u201d Carragher: \u201cEhhh ...\u201d Neville: \u201cOK, name one.\u201d Carragher: \u201cClint Hill?\u201d On stage and in the production gallery, all present dissolve into fits of laughter. With the aid of damning video evidence unearthed by the put-upon Jack, the pair proceed to savage each other\u2019s dire performances in the five-man defence England fielded in defeat against Croatia in 2006. \u201cIt\u2019s simply the best example we\u2019ve got of players not being able to do the job they\u2019re given,\u201d Chamberlin deadpans, prompting more laughter. It\u2019s late afternoon and the troops have been assembled at Sky HQ since 9am for a long day that will not conclude until 10.55pm. \u201cThere\u2019s no other thing that we do that tests us like this show, technically and in terms of pressure,\u201d says Neville, who appeared alone with Chamberlin for two seasons until being joined by Carragher 12 months ago. \u201cThe first hour is pressure, then after that you\u2019re reacting to live things that happen during the game. I always remember once after a match at Fulham with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, where he said afterwards that his team should have had a penalty. We didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, so all of a sudden we had the lads in the back frantically looking for this penalty Arsenal should apparently have had that we\u2019d not even seen.\u201d Carragher takes up the cudgels: \u201cWe try to have a theme in every show,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat\u2019s our thing this week? Three at the back. Next week? Who knows what it will be because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come up or what might happen. We discuss what we\u2019ve seen the other shows do as well, because you can\u2019t copy them. You\u2019ve got to do something different.\u201d Obsessive attention to detail is the duo\u2019s unique selling point, with each citing the other\u2019s ability to spot the small but significant nuances that can turn a game as the trait they most admire. Their passion for what they do is evidently boundless, which pleases Chamberlin no end. \u201cI love their enthusiasm for the show, but what I have enjoyed doing with them is getting across to viewers what they\u2019re really like: good fun. They love the show clearly and they really want to get it right. Trust is a big thing in what we do. They\u2019re quite easy guys to steer, really, because they\u2019re full of ideas and full of talk, but they listen to me as well.\u201d Ten minutes before broadcast and the production gallery is a hive of urgent activity. The teams have arrived at Turf Moor and footage of their respective walks from coach to dressing room is being edited for broadcast: \u201cWe need Courtois. Get an external shot of Costa.\u201d Rather than walk in single file, Burnley\u2019s players have congregated en masse to sign a football for somebody, which causes all manner of havoc. Little details. The team sheets come in and graphics are prepared accordingly. Sky\u2019s touchline interloper, Geoff Shreeves, has interviewed both managers and these interrogations are whittled into shape. In the studio, Chamberlin, Neville and Carragher are suited and booted, having returned from their customary pre-show constitutional around the perimeter of the Sky Sports car park. Earlier, Neville had got wind of a statistic which revealed the Burnley right-back Kieran Trippier had provided eight assists for the striker Danny Ings in the Championship last season. \u201cJack, create a graphic of the Ings-Trippier goals-assists, like the one we did with Kevin Nolan and Andy Carroll a few seasons ago,\u201d he ordered. Jack obliges, but now Neville\u2019s wondering if he\u2019ll have time to use it. Show-time at 7pm. Chamberlin delivers his opening line: \u201cNew era, new system, same old story at Old Trafford.\u201d In the production gallery, director East issues a steady flow of instructions with calm assurance: \u201cListening. Stand by to come back to C next. Coming back to C. Chelsea wipe again. Cue on Ed. Straight to the graphic, Ed. Animate. De-animate. Stand by X.\u201d Everything seems to be going smoothly, which suggests that in somebody\u2019s ear all these instructions must make sense. With the constant distraction of director and producer-babble in his earpiece, Chamberlin moves behind the desk to join his colleagues. Stepping, in his own words \u201cinto the Formula One car to try to steer the boys where we need to go\u201d. \u201cThe first hour of the show is the show,\u201d Carragher had previously explained and in that opening 60 minutes Chamberlin takes the boys to Loftus Road and Old Trafford, via Turin, Zagreb and Amsterdam, before pitching up at Turf Moor. Watching Neville and Carragher watch football is an education. Their favourite toy is boot-room cam, a camera providing a view of the entire pitch so they can monitor the whereabouts of all 22 players at all times. \u201cThe viewer wants to see where the ball is and what\u2019s going on around it, so we watch it differently,\u201d Neville says. Burnley\u2019s welcome back to the Premier League ends in encouraging defeat, while Monday Night Football ends an hour later with no obvious ricks or gaffes. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with that,\u201d reports Neville. \u201cI think your first one of the season, you\u2019re just getting back into it because next week we\u2019ve got Man City against Liverpool and that\u2019s big. Everyone will be watching that.\u201d Chamberlin decides the show was \u201ca bit rusty, but it was fine\u201d, a view with which Neville concurs. \u201cYeah, we were a bit rusty, but you\u2019re going to expect that after four months away or whatever it was.\u201d In his quest for improvement, Carragher has one final suggestion: \u201cLet\u2019s get a pint,\u201d he says. \u201cI need a bevvie after that.\u201d", "sentences": ["\u201cThe first hour of the show is the show,\u201d Carragher had previously explained and in that opening 60 minutes Chamberlin takes the boys to Loftus Road and Old Trafford, via Turin, Zagreb and Amsterdam, before pitching up at Turf Moor."], "title": "Gary Neville\u2019s eye for detail rules MNF\u2019s world of the sonic screwdriver | Barry Glendenning", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/aug/23/gary-neville-rules-mnf-sky-football", "tags": ["Football", "Gary Neville", "Sky Sports", "Jamie Carragher", "Sport", "Media", "Television & radio", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-08-24T04:30:00Z", "article": "When I saw the much-vaunted trailer for Fifty Shades Of Grey, I assumed the film was about to open. But no! The release date is 2015! Turns out it&apos;s one of those films so big, so hot, so throbbing*, that the mere trailer is released as an entity in itself. (*That&apos;s &quot;throbbing&quot; in the sense of public anticipation, you understand. I wouldn&apos;t want you to think Ian Botham&apos;s hacker had got hold of my laptop.) If the movie is not coming out for at least six months, that leaves plenty of time for tweaking. (That&apos;s &quot;tweaking&quot; in the sense of naked actors groping each other&apos;s nipples on camera. I wouldn&apos;t want you to think I was talking about the edit suite.) Therefore, the time feels right for me to issue some advice to its director, the peerless Sam Taylor-Wood. I am speaking as one pornographer to another.           My own porn days are long behind me. It was in 2001 that I struck out for Amsterdam with nothing but my best friend Charlie, two cheap home movie cameras (one of them without a working microphone) and a budget of \u00a315,000 with which to make the greatest blue movie of all time. The money had been fronted to us by a respectable publishing house, as part of an advance payment for which it received a book about our X-rated adventures called Once More, With Feeling. If you can get your hands on a copy of the book and have a strong stomach, I can rather recommend it. It&apos;s funny. The film is no longer available, unless you come to my house with an old VCR player and several bottles of whisky. That is probably a good thing for all concerned. The film is also funny: an excellent quality in a book, but not ideal for visual erotica. There were many reasons why we embarked on this adventure, which the book explains in far too much detail for me to reproduce here, but I can tell you our artistic aims: 1) to make the greatest blue movie of all time and 2) to make the happiest blue movie of all time, in which everyone involved would enjoy themselves, feel respected and have no regrets other than to be sorry when it was over. I would say that we were successful in our second aim. As for the first, history will be our judge. Or, rather, it won&apos;t, because I just nipped upstairs and burned the last existing copy lest anyone happened to ring my doorbell with an old VCR player and several bottles of whisky. I&apos;ve never met Sam Taylor-Wood, but I bet she has the same goals as we did: to create something brilliant, erotic and happy. Assuming that&apos;s the case, I hope she will benefit from the following experienced advice. \u2022 When it strikes you that a great way to ensure your actors feel comfortable together is to cast existing long-term couples, bear in mind there is a downside. Your fabulous and ground-breaking &quot;two gay men get it on in a mainstream porn film&quot; scene, for example, may be compromised if the two performers simply bicker all day and roll their eyes at each other&apos;s attempts to be sexy. \u2022 If your camera does not have a working microphone, remember that the other camera does. You do not want to return to the UK, watch the rushes and discover that the hot tension of the &quot;dungeon orgy&quot; scene is punctured by the sound of you opening a can of Diet Coke behind the lens. \u2022 When browsing the charity shops of Peckham for costume and props, get a range of sizes. The passionate intensity of your &quot;That priest should really be struck off!&quot; scene might be weakened if the priest&apos;s dog collar hangs down like a necklace while his cassock only reaches his elbows. \u2022 If nobody in your cast speaks English as a first language, do not make the dialogue too complicated. I can tell you, for example, that the line: &quot;I ejaculated into my brother Hong-Lau&apos;s macchiato and told him it was a new brand of creamer&quot; will require 37 takes. Even then, the only comprehensible word in the finished film will be &quot;creamer&quot;. \u2022 If you wish to include a vigorous spanking scene, this will not work unless you have either sociopathic tendencies or access to professional sound effects. The off-camera noise of an eager Dutch volunteer slapping a space hopper with a ping-pong bat is not as effective as you&apos;d think. \u2022 After your tax return has listed &quot;condoms, lube, handcuffs&quot; as deductible expenses, bear in mind that you may be asked to change accountant. \u2022 When a cheery Netherlander comes round to fix your laptop, spots the porn script and offers his friend&apos;s houseboat as a location as long as he himself can take the role of the amorous plumber, make sure that the &quot;dynamic sex wizard&quot; who plays your romantic lead does not suffer from motion sickness. \u2022 If you envisage your opening scene to be a pastoral idyll in which a beautiful pair of naked twins skip merrily through flowers and foliage, do not film it in Amsterdam in November. \u2022 If you decide to sell your film via an exclusive website that you&apos;ve set up specially, do not forget to renew the domain name. Or do. Sometimes, the unavailability of your masterpiece is the greatest gift you can give the world.", "sentences": ["It was in 2001 that I struck out for Amsterdam with nothing but my best friend Charlie, two cheap home movie cameras (one of them without a working microphone) and a budget of \u00a315,000 with which to make the greatest blue movie of all time.", "\u2022 If you envisage your opening scene to be a pastoral idyll in which a beautiful pair of naked twins skip merrily through flowers and foliage, do not film it in Amsterdam in November."], "title": "Sam Taylor-Wood could learn from my very own fifty shades of blue | Victoria Coren Mitchell", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/24/sam-taylor-wood-pornography-fifty-shades-of-blue-victoria-coren-mitchell", "tags": ["Fifty Shades of Grey", "Fifty Shades of Grey", "Pornography", "Sam Taylor-Johnson", "Culture", "Film", "Fiction", "Books"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-08-24T05:00:22Z", "article": "There\u2019s a lot of beautifying you can do on a flight.

He was born and brought up in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, the son of Raymond, an artist and toy designer, and Renee, who worked for the Helena Rubinstein cosmetics company. John went to Kingston School of Art. His fellow student, John Carter, remembers his awe at a still life by Mitchell, which emphasised the glowing cuboid space of the table on which highly generalised objects were placed, the whole painting suffused with light. After a postgraduate year at Kingston, John taught from 1964 until 1971 at Coventry School of Art, where he developed his conceptual side. He married Margaret Shott in 1965. He was influenced by Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns and in his first solo exhibition, at Camden Arts Centre, in 1972, he showed a dozen 9ft 9in square canvases, predominantly blue-grey, with occasional images of spacemen or truck wheels screen-printed on to their painted surfaces. Major solo exhibitions followed quickly with, in 1973, the first of a number at the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, and in 1974 the first of many at Galerie Swart, Amsterdam.     John Mitchell was an inspirational tutor in contemporary art    The renowned Mondrian expert, Carel Blotkamp, had recommended him to Galerie Swart and subsequently wrote about his work. In 1977 Galerie Swart exhibited six works from John&apos;s Shore series and two from his Pier series. These were emphatically vertical paintings with two asymmetric elements that produced a push-and-pull effect, impulse and echo. As principal lecturer in charge of painting, 1971-78, at Stourbridge School of Art, West Midlands, John was an inspirational and demanding tutor who required his students to understand recent developments in contemporary art, examine their preconceptions about painting, make clear choices and take responsibility for their own work. He was Gregory fellow at Leeds University, 1979-80, and exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery, London, in 1980. He revived the defunct MA in painting at Birmingham, 1980-83, and became senior research fellow in fine art at Cardiff School of Art, 1983-86. John&apos;s mature work was purely abstract and based on proportional systems, most notably the Fibonacci series. He would use successive numbers in the series as measures of area and give each size a colour from his characteristic range; turquoise blues, burnt siennas, indian reds, mustard yellows and a particular light green. He made both paintings and sculptures, and his work was always a dialogue between two and three dimensions. His hazy and atmospheric colour suggested a relationship to the visual appearance of the world and David Ross appositely described his work as &quot;Mondrian dancing with Giorgio Morandi&quot;. John&apos;s work can be seen in the Arts Council Collection, Leeds City Art Gallery and the Leeds University Collection. Margaret died in 2013. John is survived by his daughter, Alice.", "sentences": ["Major solo exhibitions followed quickly with, in 1973, the first of a number at the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, and in 1974 the first of many at Galerie Swart, Amsterdam."], "title": "John Mitchell obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/24/john-mitchell-obituary", "tags": ["Art and design", "Painting", "Art", "Art", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-08-24T13:52:43Z", "article": "The moment of clarity for cyclist Emily Brooke was less like an apple falling on her head and more like the prospect of a white van slamming into her. Like many bicycle users before her, she realised that if the vehicle beside her on the road turned left, she would be squashed as she was in the driver&apos;s blind spot. &quot;I thought that if I was just 5 metres ahead, I would be safe \u2013 I wished I had a virtual me just 5 metres ahead, if I could just project myself there,&quot; the 28-year-old said. About three years later, the designer has sold more than 3,000 Laserlight units from her company Blaze. Aimed at nighttime cyclists \u2013 50% of urban bicycle commuting is during the evening or night \u2013 the aluminium device combines a light and a laser which projects a green image of a bike onto the ground 5 metres in front of the cyclist. It attempts to make drivers, who may not see the bike in their blind spot, aware of their presence, especially at night. It also alerts pedestrians about to cross the road. Brooke got the idea while studying product design in her final year at the University of Brighton and looking at what the challenges were for urban cyclists. &quot;There is one statistic which stuck in my mind and that is that 79% of bikes that are hit are going straight ahead and a vehicle turns into them,&quot; she said. Another common collision, dubbed a Smidsy for &quot;sorry mate I didn&apos;t see you&quot;, is when a driver comes out of a junction. Brooke wanted to tackle what she saw as being the biggest challenge for city cyclists. After dismissing other ideas, like creating a full hologram of herself, came upon the idea of projecting an image on to the ground to alert drivers. Having left university, she created a prototype and was among the first tranche of companies to get the benefit of the wave of publicity that came with the advent of Kickstarter, gathering \u00a325,000 in investment in five days and proving there was demand for the product. &quot;Naysayers are people who have not seen it. I completely agree with them, it sounds completely wacky. But when you see it in practice, it is a passive green bike, passively travelling on the road in front of you,&quot; she said. &quot;It is the symbol of a bike clearly attached to a moving object moving along the ground in one direction, you see it and you orientate to &apos;where is the bike&apos;. If it doesn&apos;t make sense when you first see it, you see it once [more] and then it makes sense.&quot; Laserlights were shipped to preorders in January this year. Priced at \u00a3125, the light comes with a bracket to attach it to handlebars, is waterproof and the internally sealed battery is charged via a USB cable. The laser, assembled in Shenzhen in China, can only be used when attached to the bike. Both laser and light can be used at the same time, either flashing or in a constant beam. The green light is visible during the day but not effective, says Brooke, and is really aimed for night use when &quot;you can&apos;t miss it&quot;. The bicycle symbol - instead of branding or writing - was chosen to ensure it was universally recognised. Although her first use of the new device resulted in protests from a van driver, she claims reactions from drivers have been positive since and rejects suggestions that the device may be seen as a gimmick or unnecessary. &quot;This started from a problem first. It started from six months of a problem before I even had an idea. I looked at tracking devices \u2013 a light that lights up the rider, that you have a head torch in your face \u2013 all sorts of concepts, but it was six months of understanding the problem before I came to the solution,&quot; she said. The relatively high price is as a result of the quality of the parts used, she says. The company has just completed preorders and will now sell Laserlights through Evans Cycles shops in the UK as well as through its own website. Demand from the US \u2013 especially in cities such as San Francisco, New York, Seattle and Chicago \u2013 now accounts for half of sales, surpassing the UK. Purchases from renowned cycle-friendly cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam have highlighted different concerns for cyclists, said Brooke. &quot;For us it is personal safety and large vehicles. For them it is pedestrians stepping out in front of a bike and the Laserlight tackles that really well. Someone will see that symbol coming before they see me. It is enough for them to go &apos;Whoa, what is that&apos; and hesitate on the pavement,&quot; she said. The company has raised \u00a3500,000 in investment so far from, among others, Richard Branson&apos;s family and Index Ventures. Another round of investment, for \u00a31m, is being finalised. Blaze now has six employees, including Brooke, and would be in profit but for investment in future products, she says, one of which will be a new type of rear light, expanding on her vision to become the company that caters for the urban cyclist.", "sentences": ["Purchases from renowned cycle-friendly cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam have highlighted different concerns for cyclists, said Brooke."], "title": "Laserlight, the bright idea of a student behind a lifesaver for cyclists", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/24/laserlight-lifesaver-cyclists-emily-brooke", "tags": ["Cycling", "Life and style", "Road safety", "UK news", "Entrepreneurs", "Small business", "Business", "Technology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-08-26T19:34:02Z", "article": "A British man who died when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine has been formally identified as Glenn Thomas, a World Health Organisation (WHO) official.

She told the Blackpool Gazette last month: &quot;I can&apos;t believe it \u2013 he was the most generous, kind person who always thought about others first. Everyone that knew him knew what he was like \u2013 there&apos;s not a bad word to say about him.&quot; She said: &quot;He had never been to Australia before and he was so excited. He loved life and was doing what he does best \u2013 travelling.&quot; His nephew, Jordan, told the paper: &quot;Through all his life the one thing he said to me was go to university and go travelling.

Turning years of research into a single, coherent piece of work can be tough, so we asked for tips from supervisors and recent PhD graduates. We were inundated with tweets and emails \u2013 and @AcademiaObscura helpfully created a Storify of the tweets. Below is a selection of the best tips.  1) Make sure you meet the PhD requirements for your institution\u201cPhD students and their supervisors often presume things without checking. One supervisor told his student that a PhD was about 300 pages long so he wrote 300 pages. Unfortunately the supervisor had meant double-spaced, and the student had written single-spaced. Getting rid of 40,000 extra words with two weeks to go is not recommended.\u201d (Hannah Farrimond, lecturer in medical sociology, Exeter University) 2) Keep perspective\u201cEveryone wants their thesis to be amazing, their magnum opus. But your most important work will come later. Think of your PhD as an apprenticeship. Your peers are unlikely to read your thesis and judge you on it. They are more likely to read any papers (articles, chapters, books) that result from it.\u201d (Dean D\u2019Souza, PhD in cognitive neuroscience, Birkbeck, University of London) 3) Write the introduction last\u201cWriting the introduction and conclusion together will help to tie up the thesis together, so save it for the end.\u201d (Ashish Jaiswal, PhD in business education, University of Oxford) 4) Use apps\u201cTrello is a project management tool (available as a smartphone app) which allows you to create \u2018boards\u2019 on which to pin all of your outstanding tasks, deadlines, and ideas. It allows you to make checklists too so you know that all of your important stuff is listed and to-hand, meaning you can focus on one thing at a time. It\u2019s satisfying to move notes into the \u2018done\u2019 column too.\u201d (Lucy Irving, PhD in psychology, Middlesex University) 5) Address the unanswered questions\u201cThere will always be unanswered questions \u2013 don\u2019t try to ignore or, even worse, obfuscate them. On the contrary, actively draw attention to them; identify them in your conclusion as areas for further investigation. Your PhD viva will go badly if you\u2019ve attempted to disregard or evade the unresolved issues that your thesis has inevitably opened up.\u201d (Michael Perfect, PhD in English literature, University of Cambridge) 6) Buy your own laser printer\u201cA basic monochrome laser printer that can print duplex (two-sided) can be bought online for less than \u00a3100, with off-brand replacement toners available for about \u00a330 a pop. Repeatedly reprinting and editing draft thesis chapters has two very helpful functions. Firstly, it takes your work off the screen and onto paper, which is usually easier to proof. Secondly, it gives you a legitimate excuse to get away from your desk.\u201d (James Brown, PhD in architectural education, Queen\u2019s University Belfast) 7) Checking is important\u201cOn days when your brain is too tired to write, check quotations, bibliography etc so you\u2019re still making progress.\u201d (Julia Wright, professor of English at Dalhousie University, Canada) 8) Get feedback on the whole thesis\u201cWe often get feedback on individual chapters but plan to get feedback from your supervisor on the PhD as a whole to make sure it all hangs together nicely.\u201d (Mel Rohse, PhD in peace studies, University of Bradford) 9) Make sure you know when it will end\u201cSometimes supervisors use optimistic words such as \u2018You are nearly there!\u2019 Ask them to be specific. Are you three months away, or do you have six months\u2019 worth of work? Or is it just a month\u2019s load?\u201d (Rifat Mahbub, PhD in women\u2019s studies, University of York) 10) Prepare for the viva\u201cDon\u2019t just focus on the thesis \u2013 the viva is very important too and examiners\u2019 opinions can change following a successful viva. Remember that you are the expert in your specific field, not the examiners, and ask your supervisor to arrange a mock viva if practically possible.\u201d (Christine Jones, head of school of Welsh and bilingual studies, University of Wales Trinity St David) 11) Develop your own style\u201cTake into account everything your supervisor has said, attend to their suggestions about revisions to your work but also be true to your own style of writing. What I found constructive was paying attention to the work of novelists I enjoy reading. It may seem that their style has nothing to do with your own field of research, but this does not matter. You can still absorb something of how they write and what makes it effective, compelling and believable.\u201d (Sarah Skyrme, PhD in sociology, Newcastle University) 12) Remember that more is not always better\u201cA PhD thesis is not a race to the highest page count; don\u2019t waste time padding.\u201d (Francis Woodhouse, PhD in mathematical biology, University of Cambridge) 13) Get a buddy\u201cFind a colleague, your partner, a friend who is willing to support you. Share with them your milestones and goals, and agree to be accountable to them. This doesn\u2019t mean they get to hassle or nag you, it just means someone else knows what you\u2019re up to, and can help to check if your planning is realistic and achievable.\u201d (Cassandra Steer, PhD in criminology, University of Amsterdam) 14) Don\u2019t pursue perfectionism\u201cRemember that a PhD doesn\u2019t have to be a masterpiece. Nothing more self-crippling than perfectionism.\u201d (Nathan Waddell, lecturer in modernist literature, Nottingham University) 15) Look after yourself\u201cGo outside. Work outside if you can. Fresh air, trees and sunshine do wonders for what\u2019s left of your sanity.\u201d (Helen Coverdale, PhD in law, LSE) \u2022 Do you have any tips to add? Share your advice in the comments below.

In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, for the umpteenth time, New York gets trashed by malignant creatures with extraordinary powers, all of them destructive. In Godzilla, it is San Francisco that takes it on the chin. In Edge of Tomorrow, it is the Eiffel tower that ends up lying on its side, and the Louvre that gets pistol-whipped on an epic scale. For reasons too obvious to mention, when Hollywood decides to go to town on a great city, it usually sets its sights on New York first. Spider-Man 2, soon out on DVD, is a typical example. Here it is Manhattan, more photogenic and &quot;iconic&quot; than the four other boroughs, that bears the brunt of the assault, as well it should. Brooklyn, for all its shameless self-promotion, lacks those instantly recognisable buildings and legendary thoroughfares \u2013 the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, the Great White Way \u2013 that make it clear precisely what is being smashed to pieces, and where. Brooklyn has the Academy of Music; Manhattan has Carnegie Hall. Brooklyn has Grand Army Plaza; Manhattan has Times Square. Game, set and match to the Big Guy.           As for mobilising monsters to do a tune on dowdy, down-at-the-heels Queens or Staten Island or Da Bronx, forget it. If disaster strikes, if monsters loom, if armageddon is nigh \u2013 and when was the last time armageddon was not nigh? \u2013 it&apos;s Manhattan&apos;s assignment to take a pasting. Manhattan has been doing this stuff for a long, long time. Manhattan never fails to answer the bell. So, in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, skyscrapers topple, bridges collapse, the power grid goes down, chaos reigns. And, of course, a sea of blue-and-white police cruisers pile up in one of those massive NYPD car crashes we have all been watching for decades.      This is pretty much the same thing that happened in The Avengers and Cloverfield and Deep Impact and Independence Day and Escape from New York and The Day After Tomorrow and any number of other films, going all the way back to the original King Kong. Not to mention Ghostbusters. The cinematic despoliation of New York City is as kneejerk a cliche as the unvarying portrayal of the LAPD as unspeakably corrupt and uncompromisingly evil (LA Confidential, Training Day, Dark Blue, Internal Affairs) or at least not very nice (Gangster Squad, Mulholland Falls, Crash.) It&apos;s as predictable as making films \u2013 usually starring Colm Meaney \u2013 in which rustic Scots or Welsh or Hibernians are portrayed as canny. Or films in which Tilda Swinton plays somebody strange. It&apos;s like the running joke in Scream that no one in horror movies has ever seen a horror movie. In this case, no character in a film where Manhattan gets trashed has ever seen a film where Manhattan gets trashed. Nobody in The Amazing Spider Man 2 has ever seen Independence Day. They may not even have seen The Amazing Spider Man 1. Otherwise, they would size up the situation and head out to the Hamptons until this thing blew over. Indeed, the overwhelming evidence suggests that no one who has ever made a film in which New York gets trashed has ever seen a film in which New York gets trashed. It&apos;s as if directors and screenwriters are working in a parallel universe where everyone is an idiot. As opposed to Hollywood.           Obviously, other great cities have taken their on-screen lumps from time to time; like any other sentient creature, monsters get tired of dreary routines. In Transformers 4, it is Beijing that gets smacked around. In Godzilla, a cadre of resourceful monsters first wreck various parts of Japan, then obliterate large chunks of Hawaii, then put Las Vegas to the sword, before finally settling in to demolish San Francisco, previously ransacked in any number of films. Paris gets pulverised in Edge of Tomorrow, London gets a good walloping in Reign of Fire and 28 Days Later, and in World War Z, Jerusalem gets absolutely hammered by feisty, marauding vampires. Finally, in the lowly, earnestly cheesy Sharknado, killer flying sharks lay waste to the City of Angels. And there&apos;s not a damn thing the LAPD can do about it. Because the entire police force is busy elsewhere, being unspeakably corrupt. High-profile cities with instantly recognisable landmarks get attacked over and over and over again in the movies. Hollywood never gets tired of wreaking rack and ruin on the planet&apos;s most famous urban centres because it helps the audience get their bearings. Even little kids can say: Oh, the Eiffel Tower. That&apos;s in France. Whereas, if a film were set in Belfast, the little tykes would be at sea. The only reason no one has thought of devoting an entire film to destroying Buenos Aires on screen is because Buenos Aires is the most famous city in the world that doesn&apos;t have anything famous in it. Blow up Buenos Aires on screen and people could easily confuse it with Santiago or Caracas. Maybe even Lima. At least, unsophisticated moviegoers would. The kind of moviegoer who needs subtitles at the bottom of the screen reading: London, England Moscow, Russia Africa Let me make one thing perfectly clear: I like to watch New York and Los Angeles and Tokyo get blown up as much as the next guy. You wanna smash self-absorbed, self-adulating, holier-than-thou San Francisco to smithereens? Be my guest. But isn&apos;t this municipal-mayhem gambit getting a bit tired? Do we really need to see Manhattan destroyed again? Really? Just to give the rest of us a change from the same old, same old, couldn&apos;t some enterprising young director move all the gore and destruction away from the Big Apple and Vegas and the City of Lights to cities that could badly use the publicity? Cities that have never once been devastated on the screen? Or, even better, cities that a lot of moviegoers would like to see destroyed? Cities that really deserve to have the hammer brought down on them?           Suggestions? I have never forgiven Dallas for killing my president back in 1963. The experts always say that the murder was the work of a deranged commie marksman or the CIA or the Mafia or Fidel Castro, but I&apos;m not buying it: it was the city of Dallas that killed my charming, Catholic, Irish-American president. They were all in on it. So I would love to see the Transformers waltz right in there and give that lowbrow burgh a full-service ream job. Or maybe some of those disgusting insects from Edge of Tomorrow \u2013 via Starship Troopers \u2013 could stop by to mete out a quick dose of what Genghis Khan buffs refer to as urbicide. What other cities could benefit from a proper onscreen pasting? Toronto is another preening, self-infatuated city that has a huge chip on its shoulder. It&apos;s Brooklyn with More Ice. God, would I love to see that city get taken into the back alley for a good, long ass-kicking. Oh yes, in Godzilla 2, I&apos;d love to see Mothra and Ronin take this baby down. And then come back in Godzilla 3 to do it again. And then in Godzilla 4, just to show that they&apos;re serious about this, come back yet a fourth time and totally shred that fiercely annoying, self-worshipping yuppie metropolis. I know I&apos;ll be in the minority on this one, but I&apos;d also love to see\u00a0Edinburgh go down for the count. Twee, picture-perfect, pathologically self-congratulatory, Edinburgh is the kind of high-class tourist trap that could really benefit from a first-class pummeling, courtesy of some down-and-dirty extraterrestrials. Like Seattle and Austin and maybe even Seville, Edinburgh imagines itself as a world-class city. But\u00a0if it was really a city on a par with Berlin, Rome and New York, monsters would have stomped it decades ago. I would also love to see monsters, preferably from outer space, destroy cities on the silver screen that have already been destroyed in real life. They could call the film Re-Destroyers. Think of it as a weird brand of extraterrestrial urban renewal. Bloodthirsty drug cartels started the job in Trenton, Detroit and New Orleans; now Godzilla and Ronin are coming in to finish the job. I am not sure why I want this. Perhaps I am merely being ironic.           Some cities have unfairly been overlooked by the film industry. Amsterdam would be a perfect target for monsters. Ditto Cairo. I&apos;m sure there are even some second-tier cities \u2013 Marseille, Birmingham, Atlanta \u2013 that would actually pay film crews to pulverise their city on camera. On a personal note, one of my proudest moments as a film-goer was when I saw Philadelphia get totally jacked up by unpredictable zombies early in World War Z. As far as I can tell, my hometown had never been annihilated on the big screen and I was happy to see the City of Brotherly Love step up to the plate and get thumped like the big boys. Lots of people from second-tier cities probably feel the same way. Why don&apos;t weird creatures with thousands of tendrils ever take their anger out on Bristol? Or Liverpool? When was the last time monsters did a number on Oslo or Helsinki? And isn&apos;t it high time Reykjavik got a damned good thrashing? Finally, I know it&apos;s asking a lot, but I&apos;ve spent a lot of time in the Cotswolds, and I would be beholden to Hollywood if it would take out Stroud.

Everything it does sounds expensive. There is such depth to its string sound, such richness to its winds,\u00a0such a purr to its ensemble engine when it gets going. The players are fantastically responsive to their revered chief conductor, Mariss Jansons,\u00a0collectively poised at the end of his baton. Jansons is standing down at the end of next season for health reasons; whoever follows him has enormous shoes to fill. It feels slightly churlish to find fault with such magnificent playing, but there were several moments during the first of the Concertgebouw&apos;s concerts at the Edinburgh international festival when the orchestra&apos;s plushness, Jansons&apos; weighty interpretative choices and the spry character of the music didn&apos;t quite line up. The programme opened with Shostakovich&apos;s First Symphony. The slow movement was the dark heart of the work, solemn and hushed with tremendous gravitas. But the outer movements needed more jolt between the skittish, sardonic and frankly crass and the moments of quiet solace. The Concertgebouw handled the latter superbly but never clinched the spirit of the former. The sound was always polished; Jansons&apos; pacing was steady and sometimes just slow. The French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, never usually one for understatement, gave an affectionate and surprisingly demure account of Ravel&apos;s G major Piano Concerto. The dialogue between him and the orchestra didn&apos;t always flow, but he kept his flamboyant spark subtle and his dynamics reined in; his articulation of the Adagio&apos;s beautiful melody was simple and tender. Ravel&apos;s Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9 (Second Suite) was the orchestra&apos;s showpiece. Here Jansons&apos; broad sweep was splendid in Lever du Jour, the crest of the wave glittering and magisterial. Yet the Danse G\u00e9n\u00e9rale remained controlled, and didn&apos;t whip up the irrepressible frenzy that a truly thrilling performance of it should.", "sentences": ["Amsterdam&apos;s great orchestra is unquestionably one of the world&apos;s finest."], "title": "Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra/Jansons review \u2013 too controlled", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/28/royal-concertgebouw-orchestra-mariss-janssons-review-edinburgh", "tags": ["Mariss Jansons", "Classical music", "Dmitri Shostakovich", "Music", "Edinburgh festival", "Festivals", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-08-29T06:00:00Z", "article": "American composer Harry Partch (1901-1974) had a musical vision for which 12-toned instruments were not enough. His objection to the standard western classical scale wasn\u2019t so much along the philosophical lines of Schoenberg and other early 20th-century atonalists; he was mainly frustrated by the musical limitations of the equal-tempered octave, so devised a system that split the octave into 43 notes instead.  Partch\u2019s masterpiece is the bizarre 1960s music drama Delusion of the Fury. It is outlandish and magnificent and it spits you out wanting to dive back in and experience the whole strange thing again. And if it is hardly ever staged that\u2019s because it can\u2019t be: it requires its very own orchestra of hand-built instruments, each one specially invented by Partch to play his unique microtonal music.  Even the names of the instruments are little poems in themselves: Eucal Blossom, Zymo-Xyl, Quadrangularis Reversum, Castor &amp; Polux, Spoils of War. There are closely-tuned glass gongs and thin sheets of metal which, when tugged by strings, make loud wobbly noises. The Chromelodeon is a sort of harmonium that produces a mellow thrum. The heavy bass of the Marimba Eroica hits you first in the stomach then in the head, like a big wooden subwoofer. A zither-ish instrument plays a recurring spaghetti-western figure \u2013 glimmers of Partch\u2019s childhood in remote Arizona, like heat-haze on a long horizon. There is more to these instruments than wild names and weird sounds. What\u2019s surprising is how, well, tonal his music often ends up sounding. \u201cFor me it\u2019s early pop music,\u201d says composer and director Heiner Goebbels, whose extraordinary production of Delusion of the Fury comes to the Edinburgh International Festival this week. \u201cIt is a crazy dream grounded in solid rhythms and harmonies. It sounds like the experiments of the late Beatles and Beach Boys. As much as it is accessible, it is also impossible to grasp. Like any good artwork it is vague and enigmatic, yet at the same time instantly touching. The whole thing is magnetic. It draws you in and transports you to a different planet.\u201d     Delusion of the Fury by Harry Partch directed by Heiner Goebbels with musikFabrik. Photograph: Wonge Bergmann    What remains of Partch\u2019s original instruments are now so frail that they can\u2019t be moved from their home at Montclair State University in New Jersey, so when Goebbels decided to stage Delusion with the Cologne-based Ensemble musikFabrik he needed to somehow recreate them. It took percussionist and instrument-maker Thomas Meixner three painstaking years: each obscure material had to be sourced, each exact tuning replicated.            But the results are spectacular. Not only has Meixner successfully conjured Partch\u2019s soundworld, but the constructions look superb (after a performance in Amsterdam in June, the audience crowded around the stage, everyone keen for an up-close ogle). This isn\u2019t an incidental point. Visuals were important to Partch, who believed that the central feature of a set design should be the instruments and the people who play them. It had to do with his concept of \u2018corporeal music\u2019, in which a musician\u2019s physicality is integral to performance. \u201cThe person who plays the instrument is a part of the instrument,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a oneness, a wholeness, and if I have anything to say about it he\u2019s not going to look like an amateur Californian prune-picker.\u201d Partch called Delusion \u201ca ritualistic web\u201d. The narrative is a bleary mix of Japanese Noh theatre, Ethiopian folk mythology, Greek drama and his own wacky imagination. There are two parts, both parables: the first is serious, the second farcical, and together they carefully balance each other out. \u201cYou seem to know the scenes but you can\u2019t seem recall them, maybe because of the hazy microtonality,\u201d says Goebbels. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing with the story \u2013 I mean what is it? If he wanted to be clear he could have used words, but he didn\u2019t. I mean there are only about 25 words in the whole thing.\u201d            Goebbels\u2019s brilliantly zany set design is a cross between a warped botanical garden and a vintage American diner; props include massive inflatable slugs, a roaming KFC mascot and a gaffer-tape goat. \u201cSome people think that I took drugs when I was designing it,\u201d the 61-year-old German tells me with a hint of a smile. \u201cI guess they aren\u2019t used to seeing such colourfulness from me. But no, I didn\u2019t take drugs.\u201d In fact he simply tried to follow Partch\u2019s score as closely as possible. \u201cThe more precisely we followed, the better it became. This is a dreamworld but its construction is so intricate \u2013 anything but hazy. Balancing looseness and precision was the biggest challenge. It should sound like a pop group performing, but you need academic musicians who can read super-complex scores.\u201d If any ensemble could pull it off, it had to be musikFabrik. Run as a musicians\u2019 collective, these contemporary music specialists have a serious appetite for off-the-wall projects. They always look as though they\u2019re having enormous fun, too, whether they\u2019re playing Lachenmann, Stockhausen or Frank Zappa. \u201cEven just agreeing to perform Delusion was a huge step,\u201d says Goebbels. \u201cTo leave behind their regular instruments \u2013 which they have practiced for six hours a day, every day for 30 years or more \u2013 that is an enormous liberator in itself. I think the experience will change the way they play forever. Once you absorb the corporeality of Partch\u2019s music, it doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d Goebbels himself has been composing iconic staged works since the 1980s, full of their own beguiling rituals and physicality. \u201cBack then I thought I was developing a new format,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it turns out Partch had already done it in the 50s and 60s. He was so far ahead.\u201d Goebbels pauses. \u201cWe are very different people, of course. I\u2019m rarely drunk; he was often drunk. Towards the end of his life he was full of anger and that gave him a lot of creative energy. But I have sympathy for his anti-establishment beliefs. He didn\u2019t make artistic compromises. This is something I think about a lot, and I respect Partch for being so totally non-conformist \u2013 for just doing his incredible thing.\u201d \u2022 Delusion of the Fury: a Ritual of Dream and Delusion is at King\u2019s Theatre, Edinburgh, 29 &amp; 30 August.  \u2022 Have a (virtual) go on Partch\u2019s instruments yourself         ", "sentences": ["Not only has Meixner successfully conjured Partch\u2019s soundworld, but the constructions look superb (after a performance in Amsterdam in June, the audience crowded around the stage, everyone keen for an up-close ogle)."], "title": "Harry Partch \u2013 how  Heiner Goebbels bought Delusion of the Fury to Edinburgh", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/29/harry-partch-delusion-of-the-fury-heiner-goebbels-edinburgh", "tags": ["Classical music", "Experimental music", "Music", "Edinburgh festival", "Edinburgh festival 2014", "Stage", "Culture", "Festivals"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-08-29T16:43:00Z", "article": "Malaysia Airlines is to slash its staff numbers by a third, cutting 6,000 jobs, after the airline suffered the two worst disasters in modern aviation only five months apart. The carrier had been struggling financially even before the disasters that beset it this year, starting with the unexplained disappearance of flight MH370 with 239 people aboard in March. The airline&apos;s name became synonymous with disaster after a second major tragedy in July, when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing 298 passengers and crew. The 6,000 job losses announced in Kuala Lumpur on Friday are part of a major restructuring of the airline, including the appointment of a new chief executive by next year. The state announced plans to take full ownership of its 77-year-old flag carrier after trading in the airline&apos;s shares was suspended last month, when it was valued at less than 15% of its 2012 peak. Currently Malaysia&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, Khazanah Nasional, is the 69% majority owner, and plans to buy out other shareholders at a premium. Malaysia Airlines will also review its routes, after flying with high numbers of empty seats on many of its planes. The airline has been adding flight capacity and slashing fares to get customers aboard, meaning overall passenger numbers have only dropped by 0.3% year on year. Revenue dropped 5% in the three months from April to June even as available seats rose 9% from 2013. The full effect on sales has yet to be seen as the airline offered full refunds to passengers who had booked to fly later in the year after the shooting down of MH17. One route that will continue is the twice-daily service between Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur, a high-capacity service operated with Malaysia&apos;s Airbus A380 superjumbo. A London-based Malaysia Airlines spokesman said: &quot;The London-Kuala Lumpur route is highly successful and will carry on. Today&apos;s announcement is all about rebuilding the airline after these two awful incidents. The airline is being reshaped and the aim is to return it to profitability.&quot; Analysts anticipate that Malaysia&apos;s restructuring could extend to selling off its engineering, airport services or budget airline units.           Not all of Malaysia&apos;s staff may be unwilling to leave the airline: it emerged this week that almost 200 cabin crew had already quit this year, citing family pressure and fear of flying after the two disasters, which claimed the lives of 27 crew. Unions reported that those who remained were often working extended hours due to staff shortages. Sales have been hit hard since March, with customers from China deserting the airline after the disappearance of MH370, which was carrying 152 Chinese citizens among the 227 passengers presumed to have died. The airline lost \u00a358.5m in the last quarter, putting it on track to exceed the \u00a3222m loss it recorded in 2013. John Strickland, of the independent aviation consultancy JLS Consulting, said turning around Malaysia Airlines&apos; fortunes was not impossible but &quot;a very steep mountain to climb&quot;. He added: &quot;It&apos;s not going to be a quick fix. On one hand, they should be well placed: they are in an extremely buoyant market in Asia. But they have got stiff competition from budget rivals Air Asia and Air Asia X, quality neighbouring airlines like Singapore, and the Gulf carriers. &quot;They face all these current challenges on top of a lengthy history of being overmanned and suffering state interference. They have to reduce their operations, take capacity out of the market where it&apos;s not profitable, and overcome the public reaction to these incidents: to show they are compassionate and restore confidence that they are nothing but safety focused as an airline.&quot; An intensive underwater search for MH370 will resume next month, after the mapping of a 34,000sq mile area of the southern Indian Ocean floor by two survey ships. The Boeing 777 disappeared on 8 March en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A broad international search operation revealed no physical trace of the plane, but analysis of satellite signals has led authorities to believe it crashed in the sea west of Australia. Dutch investigators are expected to issue an interim report soon on the MH17 crash in eastern Ukraine.

Until last year, I couldn\u2019t. I\u00a0missed the usual window to learn by spending the ages 16 to 21 in a band. I\u00a0was \u2013 I often reflect \u2013 partially raised by roadies. They taught me many things: how to break down an onstage backline in under 25 minutes, the best way to wind a kettle lead, places never to go in Amsterdam and (related) why you should stop doing speed bombs before you turn green. When it came to food, however, the roadies\u2019 knowledge was scant. So long as that night\u2019s venue laid on a decent chilli, there was nothing more to know. Crisps and the music of Hawkwind were their fuel \u2013 welcome necessities that were consumed habitually but uncritically. When I landed in London at 22, I shared a flat with four other girls who were all gourmets. Our diverse backgrounds were reflected in our tiny, individual kitchen cupboards. Dee\u2019s Norwegian crispbreads and brunost sat happily beside Anita\u2019s star anise and ghee. My cupboard contained a box of muesli (unopened) and a lone spoon and bowl. To be fair, I had a very active social life, and some cocktails contain fruit. A year later, weighing the same as a racing bike, I\u00a0moved in with Mr Laverne, who is a phenomenal cook. I made him dinner once (mashed potato and pizza) before it was agreed that we would play to our differing strengths. The\u00a0kitchen would be his department. So it remained until Comic Relief asked me to try doing something I was terrible at as part of its 2013 Twitrelief initiative. It was immediately obvious it would have to be cooking, at which I believed I was irredeemably awful. Culinary talent was one of those skills I admired in others, like smalltalk, ballroom dancing, jujitsu and nuclear physics. I headed up a team of fundraisers on Twitter, each of us sponsored to do something tricky or unusual for a fortnight. Fourteen harrowing days later, my family were still alive and I had discovered that, actually, I quite liked cooking. There were more failures than triumphs: I immolated a quiche, violated a chicken and baked a chocolate cake that looked and tasted like it was made of shoes. But my small successes were enough to keep me going. I thought it might become a hobby; for fauxhemain urbanites like me, food is usually a leisure activity. Ingredients are chosen for their cachet as much as their flavour; people change dietary preferences along with their hair. In fact, cooking brought the politics of food on to my kitchen table. Along with learning to braise, poach, broil and render, I acquired a keener awareness of what might be called \u201cnutritional advantage\u201d. Food knowledge is power \u2013 physically, personally and socially. I\u00a0had understood the extremes of this phenomenon \u2013 swan meat and Turkey Twizzlers \u2013 but my new engagement with the subject illustrated the many instances in between. I met the women who run a fair-trade wholefoods factory in my hometown. Their products aren\u2019t in supermarkets there (people can\u2019t afford them), but on my high street in London there are\u00a0four stockists. Reading cookbooks unlocked the middle-class attitude to food \u2013 which I had not grown up around, and always found anxiety-inducing (I remember, in my early 20s, being scolded by a TV exec for ordering a \u201cbuilder\u2019s breakfast\u201d before London started fetishising that kind of thing). I realised that the middle classes cook\u00a0(and eat) like they decorate: expertly, heavy on borrowed authenticity, low on perceptible effort and frills. It will never come naturally to me, but that\u2019s fine. Learning to cook helped me understand myself. I will never belong to the foodie elite but I appreciate the riches I already enjoy as a hungry woman who can afford \u2013 and knows how to make \u2013 her\u00a0next meal.

Created in 2009, it is a tourist attraction boasting two daily performances by 100 dwarves, who live and work in an elaborate fantasy world ruled by an emperor and empress. To western eyes, it looks like a remnant of the Victorian freak show. \u201cIn 2011, I accidentally found an image online of Chinese tourists posing with little people,\u201d says Sanne De Wilde, a young Belgian-born, Amsterdam-based photographer. \u201cIt was a bit shocking, but it made me curious.\u201d Shortly afterwards, having spent several weeks liaising with the owners, De Wilde travelled to China to visit the Dwarf Empire. \u201cNothing quite prepared me for the unreality of the place,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the brochures, it looks colourful and a little fantastic, like a modern theme park, but the reality is much greyer and a little sad. People pay to come here, to see a song-and-dance performance, and to have their pictures taken with the little people. To westerners, it may seem voyeuristic and immoral, but this is China and \u2013 for the people who come here with their children, and for many of the performers \u2013 this is simply not an issue.\u201d De Wilde knew immediately that she had found an amazing subject, but one that was loaded with all kinds of issues, from complex problems of representation to accusations of voyeurism. \u201cEssentially, I did not want, as a photographer, to become part of the problem I was trying to highlight. I wanted to go deeper, into the contradictions and paradoxes of the place, the creation of a fantasy that was paper thin and yet one that visitors bought into.\u201d     \u2018To westerners, it may seem voyeuristic and immoral, but this is China and \u2013 for the people who come here and for many of the performers \u2013 this is simply not an issue,\u2019 says De Wilde Photograph: Sanne De Wilde    Four years in the making, the end result, a photobook called The Dwarf Empire that she plans to publish soon, deftly negotiates these issues, while allowing the viewer to witness the often dull and mundane world behind the fantasy. \u201cI had no interest in photographing the actual performances,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead, I was interested in how the performers lived in between the two daily shows, in this enclosed world behind the fake wooden walls and ornate facades. To do that, I needed to get to know the people I was photographing.\u201d Initially, De Wilde hired a translator, but there was a problem. \u201cI realised she simply wasn\u2019t asking the questions I was giving her. She kept saying, \u2018No, we don\u2019t need to go there.\u2019 For her, it was all about maintaining the facade. Then I had to think about the images in a very practical way. For instance, I didn\u2019t want a series where people were looking upwards all the time at the camera, or where everything \u2013 furniture, beds, rooms \u2013 looked miniature. So I started shooting while crouched down. Practically as well as conceptually, it was an incredibly difficult project mainly because I was questioning myself all the time.\u201d The most difficult part of all, though, was her own interaction with the tourists, many of whom treated her as another novelty within the theme park. \u201cIt was as if I was becoming this tall, white, blond-haired Snow White figure that they also wanted to photograph constantly. People would grab me and push me into a picture, force me into a frame. At one point, I couldn\u2019t breathe so I ran around the back, behind the facade, and hid with some people I had become friendly with.\u201d     For many residents, says De Wilde, the Dwarf Empire provided \u2018not just a community, but a sense of belonging\u2019. Photograph: Sanne De Wilde    De Wilde also decided to include photographs taken by her subjects, \u201cto give them a space to articulate what they felt and what their everyday lives were like\u201d. Many took photographs of her; others recorded their daily routine, much of which consists of waiting, bored and listless, between shows. Nevertheless, when De Wilde interviewed several of her subjects, including a couple who had left the Dwarf Empire, they regarded it as \u201ca wonderful place and even a kind of paradise\u201d. For them, she says, it provided \u201cnot just a community, but a sense of belonging\u201d. When she asked people if they were happy, they tended not to understand the question. \u201cIn the west, we obsess about happiness, but for them, as for most people in China, happiness does not come into it \u2013 it\u2019s about survival.\u201d De Wilde\u2019s book will be divided into three main sections: her photographs of the little people, their photographs of her, and two foldout posters featuring individual portraits of the performers alongside biographical information \u2013 names, dates, places of birth, heights. \u201cTheir height is the thing that most informs their lives,\u201d she says, \u201cso it seemed incredibly important to include it.\u201d Likewise, she has included what she calls \u201canti-postcards\u201d (her images of \u201cthe daily reality of life in the park\u201d), as well as an insert of images created by her subjects in response to the question: how would you ideally like to be seen? \u201cOne woman Photoshopped herself into a frame held up by two western women,\u201d says De Wilde. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex image on so many levels.\u201d How does she feel about the Dwarf Empire now? \u201cIt\u2019s complicated and contradictory. For instance, I included a photograph in which two security guards hold up one of the smallest women in the palm of their hands. It\u2019s an image that newspapers and magazines tend to want to print, and it is perhaps the most dramatic, but it is not the most representative. The Dwarf Empire is a commercial business that is not very respectful to the people it puts on show. But, by Chinese standards, they are paid and treated well. It is voyeuristic, but so is reality TV and a lot of the internet. These are the areas I am interested in \u2013 how we look at otherness and what that says about us.\u201d \u2022 The Dwarf Empire: China\u2019s theme park staffed by little people \u2013 in pictures \u2022 SanneDeWilde.com", "sentences": ["\u201cIn 2011, I accidentally found an image online of Chinese tourists posing with little people,\u201d says Sanne De Wilde, a young Belgian-born, Amsterdam-based photographer."], "title": "Inside China\u2019s Dwarf Empire", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/02/dwarf-empire-china-photography-sanne-de-wilde", "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Culture", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-03T14:55:59Z", "article": "Nelson Freire is now firmly established as one of the great pianists of our age, but that recognition has been slow in coming. Until the past 10 years or so, the Brazilian pianist remained a bit of a secret. He has been hugely admired by colleagues, but reticent about publicity, and a slightly reluctant recording artist, so his early career \u2013 he made his international debut in 1959 \u2013 was never documented on discs as thoroughly as it might have been. This compilation of radio tapes, to mark Freire&apos;s 70th birthday next month, fills in some of those gaps. The collection begins with Chopin&apos;s First Concerto from a 1968 concert in Kiel, with the NDR Symphony under Heinz Wallberg, and ends with Rachmaninov&apos;s Third, with David Zinman and the Rotterdam Philharmonic in Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw in 1979. In between are performances of Schumann&apos;s Introduction and Concert Allegro Op 134, and Tchaikovsky&apos;s First, Prokofiev&apos;s First and Liszt&apos;s Second concertos. There&apos;s not a dud among them. Each bar is full of the vitality that Freire brings to everything he plays, though the recorded orchestral sound is a bit dry and bright \u2013 and the orchestras aren&apos;t always immaculate. But Freire&apos;s fabulously clean phrasing and pearly tone are never compromised, and each concerto is special in one way or another. A few do stand out. In the Tchaikovsky, with Kurt Masur and the ORTF Philharmonic from 1969, both pianist and conductor strip away anything that is remotely hackneyed about this overfamiliar war horse, so that every texture gleams. The performance is taken in a single glorious sweep, while there&apos;s astonishing lightness and poise about the solo playing in the Liszt (with the Bavarian Radio Symphony under Freire&apos;s compatriot Eleazar de Carvalho). The evenness and beauty of the scales in the slow introduction are breathtaking. And though Rachmaninov is not a composer with whom he has been particularly associated (other than recording the Second Suite for two pianos with Martha Argerich), Freire&apos;s account of the Third Concerto crackles with intensity. It may not be as emotionally searching as some performances, but it&apos;s thrillingly alert to every twist and turn of the formidably challenging solo writing.", "sentences": ["The collection begins with Chopin&apos;s First Concerto from a 1968 concert in Kiel, with the NDR Symphony under Heinz Wallberg, and ends with Rachmaninov&apos;s Third, with David Zinman and the Rotterdam Philharmonic in Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw in 1979."], "title": "Nelson Freire: Radio Days \u2013 Concerto Broadcasts 1968-1979 review \u2013 not a dud among them", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/03/nelson-freire-radio-days-concerto-broadcasts-1968-1979-review", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-04T11:46:00Z", "article": "Dutch authorities leading an international investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine plan to publish a preliminary report next week.

He knows that he is yielding to a habit of life which will inevitably drag him down, and he is filled with self-pity and remorse \u2026 He knows that the temporary thrill of excitement will be followed by deadly depression and by the degradation of his intellect and imagination.&quot; More than a century later, theatre audiences can see the latest fictitious incarnations of degraded intellects and imaginations in Great Britain, Richard Bean&apos;s play about the phone hacking scandal, which is about to transfer from the National Theatre to the West End. When Paschal O&apos;Leary, the play&apos;s amoral media proprietor, appears in front of a parliamentary committee and tells them that &quot;this is the hungriest day of my life&quot;, the audience laughs cheerfully in recognition. And they laugh again when newspaper executive Virginia White asks, as the conspiracy unravels: &quot;What have we done?&quot; What indeed? The problem now with any novel or play about journalism is how to improve on reality. After all, what author would write a story about an editor and her deputy having an adulterous affair while, on their front pages, they haughtily condemn a politician for doing exactly the same? And what television screenwriter would not have wished to have come up with a &quot;fake sheikh&quot; as the perfect lead character for a comedy series about the press?     Evelyn Waugh in 1947. Photograph: AP    Ask most journalists about the best books on their trade and you can be fairly sure that Scoop by Evelyn Waugh and Towards the End of the Morning by Michael Frayn will be mentioned. But there are dozens more where attempts have been made to capture a world of\u00a0crazed proprietors and reckless reporters at the dark end of the Street. And doubts about the ethics of the press were being expressed in fictional form even in Queen Victoria&apos;s time. In George Gissing&apos;s New Grub Street, published in 1891, we have a proprietor who creates Chit-Chat, a parody of the magazine Tit-Bits, which had come into being 10 years earlier and died only in 1984: &quot;From the first number, the success of the enterprise was beyond doubt; in a month&apos;s time all England was ringing with the fame of this noble new development of journalism; the proprietor saw his way to a solid fortune \u2026 It was clear that the quarter-educated would be abundantly provided with literature to their taste.&quot; There is a much richer portrait of the early days of Fleet Street in Gibbs&apos;s The Street of Adventure, at a time when the news was of &quot;unemployed riots in Manchester, the suffrage raid on the House, the colonial secretary at Leeds&quot;. Our cub reporter hero, Frank Luttrell, is given light-hearted advice by the editor of a newspaper based on the short-lived Liberal party daily, the Tribune: &quot;Don&apos;t wear your hair long. Don&apos;t wear a bowler hat with a tail-coat. Don&apos;t say &apos;on a ship&apos;. Don&apos;t use a foreign word when there is an English word in the dictionary. Don&apos;t have serious convictions on any subjects in the world.&quot; But the first world war came soon afterwards and Gibbs, in his foreword to an American edition in 1919, notes how this had changed his and his characters&apos; view of the world and their &quot;cynical amusement at the folly of human nature&quot;. From New Grub Street to Great Britain, the larger-than-life proprietor is a stock character, mirroring the real-life Beaverbrooks, Rothermeres, Maxwells and Murdochs. In Scoop (1938), the boss of the Beast newspaper, Lord Copper, announces that &quot;the Beast stands for strong mutually antagonistic governments everywhere. Self-sufficiency at home, self-assertion abroad.&quot; Plus ca change. The proprietor \u2013 &quot;the Baron&quot; \u2013 in Robert Harling&apos;s The Paper Palace, published in 1950, has &quot;cunning enough to keep two million housewives as happy as if they had seen a murder or fought the rape the Baron gave them every morning for breakfast&quot;. Harling, who died aged 98 in 2008, having led a very full life both in war and peacetime, editing House &amp; Garden and working at the Sunday Times in its glory days under Harold Evans, also gave us another familiar character: the jaded reporter who owes something to the hard-boiled private eyes of American literature. In The Paper Palace, he is a world-weary cynic\u00a0who hangs out in El Vino&apos;s, drinks double martinis, smokes in bed and has affairs with other men&apos;s wives. He sees his readers through jaundiced eyes as &quot;dried old women with hapless eyes, doomed old men with falling jowls, painted typists and brassy clerks, scrub-faced soldiers and minders of machines. All for a penny could have my words.&quot; Two of the best-known books on journalism were suppressed at the time of their publication for dubious legal reasons. Malcolm Muggeridge&apos;s Picture Palace came out in 1934 as a barely disguised satire poking fun at the Manchester Guardian and its more profitable and less sober sister, the Manchester Evening News, represented as the Accringthorpe Courier and Evening Gazette, the latter of which carried &quot;sensational crime stories&quot; and &quot;sex exploitation&quot;. The book was quite sexually explicit for its time and was described by the Guardian&apos;s Arthur Ransome \u2013 better known for Swallows and Amazons \u2013 as &quot;pornographic&quot; and &quot;caddish&quot;. Following a threat of libel action from the Guardian, it was withdrawn and not republished until 1987 with an introduction by Richard Ingrams in which he suggested that the libel action confirmed Muggeridge&apos;s view of &quot;the humbug that lies at the core of liberalism&quot;. The story behind The Crooked Sixpence by Murray Sayle is also worth a novel in itself. Published in 1960, it included a louche character called Michael Macedon, based on a friend of\u00a0Sayle&apos;s called Michael Alexander, a hard-up toff who thought he could make some easy money by threatening to sue for libel when the book came out. The plan misfired and the publishers spinelessly pulped the book. It did not appear again until 2008, after Alexander&apos;s death, when Revel Barker republished it with a front page recommendation from Philip Knightley: &quot;The best book about journalism \u2013 ever.&quot; Well, up to a point, Lord Copper. Sayle, an admired foreign correspondent, started his career in the 1950s as a legman for Duncan Webb, the legendary \u2013 I think we are allowed to use that word, he certainly would have done \u2013 People reporter who exposed the Soho vice rings of the time. Webb, disguised as Norman Knight, &quot;the best crime man in Fleet Street&quot;, gives the Australian ingenue James O&apos;Toole (Sayle) a masterclass on reporting on vice. &quot;The secret of this game is never open your fly,&quot; he tells him helpfully. &quot;Not on the job that is.&quot; In one prescient episode, Knight/Webb tells his quarry: &quot;We&apos;re fighting vice and rats like you who run it.&quot; To which his victim replies: &quot;What do you mean, fighting vice? You&apos;re selling it, same as me. Don&apos;t give me any of that high-and-mighty talk.&quot; Finally, O&apos;Toole is sent off to expose a man who has changed sex \u2013plus ca change, again \u2013 but that is his epiphany and he decides to quit the Street. &quot;Anyone who could lie and play-act and angle and slant and rearrange week after week and never be caught and who was prepared to do it for a bank manager&apos;s wages was himself the victim of a confidence trick,&quot; he concludes sadly. Female journalists feature much less frequently than their male counterparts, although there is a very lively reporter, Katherine Halstead, in\u00a0The Street of Adventure. She turns down an offer of marriage by saying, &quot;I dare say it would be amusing for a little while, but afterwards the woman gets so tired of it all \u2013\u00a0women like me, I mean \u2026 selfish, restless creatures, who have got the poison of Fleet Street in their blood.&quot; There is also a female reporter, Myrna Charrington, in The Upper Pleasure Garden (1970) by the Scottish writer Gordon M Williams, who worked on both local and national papers before becoming a full-time novelist, screenwriter and ghost. Her office nickname is Chastity. She tells the main character: &quot;I&apos;m quite aware that none of you take me seriously. It happens in every newspaper office \u2013 a woman is either an easy lay or a stuck-up little virgin. One has to fight to stop men laughing at one.&quot;     Annalena McAfee. Photograph: Richard Saker    However, The Spoiler, published in 2011 but set in 1997, by Annalena McAfee, the first editor of Guardian Review, has two women at its centre. One is the grande dame international Pulitzer-winning war correspondent, Honor Tait; the other is Tamara Sim, a twentysomething more at home with celebrity tales and compiling lists of &quot;Losers and Boozers \u2013 Top 10 Rehab Write-offs&quot;. The nearest Tamara gets to a war zone is her dressing table, which accommodates &quot;lipsticks scattered like spent bullets&quot;. Tait finds herself having to sell her book in the familiar way of submitting to an interview by someone who has not quite managed to read it. The Spoiler also reflects the groundshifting arrival of the internet: &quot;How could they possibly work for the website? The print was their medium. They knew nothing about computers and cared about them even less.&quot; Apart from the megalomaniacal proprietor, the self-lacerating hack and the beleaguered woman reporter, nostalgia for lost golden ages of journalism runs through many of the books. &quot;It&apos;s because editors have all got the blue funk,&quot; says a character in The Street of Adventure. And in Graham Greene&apos;s The Quiet American, published in 1955, his Vietnam-based foreign correspondent, Thomas Fowler, complains to his colleague, Wilkins, that &quot;Space is tight these days. They won&apos;t want much.&quot; To which Wilkins replies: &quot;The spice has gone out of the dish, hasn&apos;t it? \u2026 We ought to have lived in the days of Russell and the old Times&quot; \u2013 William Howard Russell, who covered the Crimea war \u2013 &quot;Dispatches by balloon. One had time to do some fancy writing then.&quot; This nostalgia is reflected in Frayn&apos;s Towards the End of the Morning (1967). In his introduction to a new edition in 2000, Frayn says, as far as Fleet Street was concerned, that &quot;the shades of night were gathering fast&quot;. But even in the 1960s the hierarchy was still clear: the foreign editor, literary editor, diplomatic correspondent and rugby correspondent grab a taxi for lunch at the Garrick, the advertising executives &quot;sip hock&quot; at El Vino&apos;s, the editor goes to the Athenaeum, while the newsdesk, subs and assistant industrial editor drink at the Gates of Jerusalem, all part of a journalistic drinking culture that has all but dried up today. Three years later, in The Upper Pleasure Garden \u2013 recently described in the Scotsman as &quot;the greatest novel about newspaper hackdom, ever&quot; \u2013 there is a lament that &quot;the romance was all gone from newspapers. Everybody said that \u2026 accountants were taking over, the union was trying to make it a profession and the owners were trying to make it a business.&quot; There are dozens of other novels that explore different aspects of the press. Ed O&apos;Loughlin&apos;s Not Untrue and Not Unkind has Owen Simmons, a\u00a0foreign correspondent filing from modern Africa rather than 1950s Vietnam, but sharing much of the scepticism of Greene&apos;s earlier antihero. David Nobbs tackles the gentler world of local journalism through his hapless reporter, Henry Pratt. Philip Norman&apos;s Everyone&apos;s Gone to the Moon is about working on the Sunday Times colour magazine in\u00a0the 60s and there are individual journalists such as Will Farnaby in Aldous Huxley&apos;s Island, gossip columnist Adam Symes in Waugh&apos;s Vile Bodies and the editor Vernon Halliday in Ian McEwan&apos;s Amsterdam. Nor is Great Britain the first time that a playwright has tried to bring the\u00a0world of newspapers to the stage. David Hare and Howard Brenton&apos;s Pravda is one notable example, while Arnold Wesker attempted it with The Journalists, based on the time he spent researching at the Sunday Times in 1971. This was a bruising experience that led to battles with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which declined to stage it, and with two journalists at the paper who objected to his later account of the affair, which can now be read in his book, The Journalists, a Triptych (1979). An angry Wesker concluded: &quot;The journalist knows his world is among the\u00a0least perfect of all imperfect worlds. Most are raring to get out and write books \u2013 the best of them do, frustrated by small canvases and the butterfly life.&quot; And Doug Lucie in his 1997 play, The Shallow End, has Alison Toop, the wife of his fictitious political editor, tell a young correspondent: &quot;don&apos;t be too categorical in your chastisement of others who abuse their power, since yours is one of the most abused powers in the world \u2026 don&apos;t confuse freedom of the press with freedom of the people. Given the tiny ideological gene pool which currently owns most of the media I would say the two were definitely not interchangeable.&quot; The late Harry Procter, a famous \u2013 yes, legendary \u2013 crime reporter of the 1950s, described in his bittersweet memoir, The Street of Disillusion, how, as a 15-year-old working in the rat-infested basement of a store in Leeds, he had been inspired by reading The Street of Adventure to head for Fleet Street. One wonders if any teenager seeing Great Britain today would be attracted to a world as cynical and brittle as that portrayed on stage.

But the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) says: &quot;There are no indications that the MH17 crash was caused by a technical fault or by actions of the crew.&quot; The Boeing 777 was blown up in mid-air on 17 July over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board. The black boxes were retrieved intact, with the flight recorders showing a completely normal flight before impact. Radio communications with Ukrainian air traffic control confirm that no emergency call was made by the cockpit crew. The pattern of wreckage on the ground suggests that the aircraft split into pieces during flight. The report shows how easily a different airliner could have met the fate of the doomed plane instead, had the crew of MH17 been able to comply with a controller&apos;s request to fly higher in the minutes before it was shot down. Air traffic controllers were attempting to clear traffic as three other commercial flights, unidentified in the report, were in the vicinity \u2013 two other Boeing 777s and one Airbus A330. At 12.53pm, Ukrainian air traffic controllers at Dnipropetrovsk asked MH17 to climb 2,000 feet to flight level 350 over eastern Ukraine, in accordance with the original flight plan, to clear a &quot;potential separation conflict&quot; with another Boeing 777. The crew said they were unable to comply, possibly due to weather. Instead, at least one other plane climbed higher. Just after 1pm the crew, running into bad weather, requested to climb to 34,000 feet \u2013 although air traffic control said the plane should keep at the same altitude. At 1.20pm, MH17 exploded in mid-air. The other plane was not identified by investigators but it is known that a large Singapore Airlines jet, many of which are 777s, was nearby. Kiev and the west have accused pro-Russia separatists of shooting down the plane with a surface-to-air missile supplied by Moscow. Russia, which denies mounting western claims of direct involvement in the five-month conflict in Ukraine, has blamed government forces for the attack. Russia, Ukraine, the US, the UK, Malaysia and Australia were all given the politically sensitive report for review, and investigators say they have since amended it before publication. The report is being issued just days after a ceasefire backed by Kiev and Moscow came into force on Friday to try to end a war that has killed more than 2,700 people and led to at least half a million fleeing their homes. Tjibbe Joustra, chairman of the DSB, said: &quot;The MH17 crash has shocked the world and raised many questions. The Dutch Safety Board wishes to determine the cause of the crash, for the sake of the loved ones of the victims and for society at large. &quot;The initial results of the investigation point towards an external cause of the MH17 crash. More research will be necessary to determine the cause with greater precision. The safety board believes that additional evidence will become available for investigation in the period ahead.&quot; The plane was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was destroyed. Most of the victims were Dutch, with 193 of the 283 passengers and 15 crew who died coming from the Netherlands. Last week the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, said he wanted to dispatch more investigators to eastern Ukraine before winter to gather more evidence.

The report by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB), does not speculate on the origin or nature of objects, noting its investigators have not been able to visit the crash site because their security could not be guaranteed in the midst of the conflict between Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatist forces. The findings are consistent with US and Ukrainian assertions the Boeing 777, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was brought down by an anti-aircraft missile, which they say was provided by Russia. However, some air-to-air missiles also have fragmentation warheads which spray small shrapnel when they detonate close to a target. The DSB report rules out other possible causes for the crash, which killed all 298 people on board, saying: &quot;There are no indications that the MH17 crash was caused by a technical fault or by actions of the crew.&quot; It found that the shrapnel came from outside the plane and hit the cockpit above the level of the floor, implying it sheared through the space occupied by the pilots. The front parts of the plane broke away first, leaving the rest of the aircraft to fly on for some distance, with parts of the rear and centre ending up miles further east than the cockpit. The US and Ukraine have accused separatists of shooting down the plane with a surface-to-air BUK missile, which explodes near its target, peppering it with high-velocity shrapnel. Moscow has denied the charge, pointing instead at the Ukrainian air force. Rebel leaders have by turns admitted and denied possessing a BUK system. On Monday Alexander Zakharchenko, the prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&apos;s Republic, told Russia&apos;s Interfax new agency: &quot;We simply do not have the military hardware capable of shooting down a Boeing passenger jet such as the Malaysian plane.&quot; The Dutch board was given the lead in drawing up the report because 193 of the 283 passengers and 15 crew who died came from the Netherlands. Russia, Ukraine, the US, the UK, Malaysia and Australia were all given the politically sensitive report for review. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said: &quot;We have to guard against drawing premature conclusions. The case is still wide open.&quot; According to the report, the plane&apos;s black boxes \u2013 the flight data recorder and digital cockpit voice recorder \u2013 both stopped at 20 seconds past 1.20pm. No alerts or alarms can be heard or any sign of distress. The last voice communication from the cockpit came 24 seconds earlier \u2013 an acknowledgement of the latest routine course instructions from air traffic control. Unable to raise MH17, Dnipropetrovsk asked the next air traffic control centre along the route, at Rostov, if it could see the plane on its screens. Controllers replied: &quot;No, it seems that its target started falling apart.&quot; As the plane approached eastern Ukraine at 12.53pm, responsibility for its flight path passed to air traffic control at Dnipropetrovsk. The controllers asked the pilots to climb from 33,000ft to 35,000ft to stick to the original flight plan and to keep away from other airliners in the area. Air traffic controllers were attempting to clear traffic as three other commercial flights, unidentified in the report, were in the vicinity \u2013 two other Boeing 777s and one Airbus A330. These other planes were not identified by investigators but it is known that a large Singapore Airlines jet was nearby. The MH17 told air traffic control &quot;were unable to comply&quot; with the request to gain altitude and asked instead to stay at 33,000ft. The reason for this is not spelled out, but it could be because of weather: there were some thunderstorms in the area. In fact, at 13.00, according to the report, the flight turned slightly to the left &quot;due to weather&quot;. The crew then asked to climb to 34,000ft, but air traffic control said the plane should keep at the same altitude. Twenty minutes later it was brought down. Air traffic restrictions had been in force over eastern Ukraine since 1 July because of the conflict. As of 14 July, the minimum altitude for commercial airliners was raised to 32,000ft. MH17 was flying 1,000ft above that. About 90 minutes after the downing of MH17, Ukrainian air traffic restrictions over eastern Ukraine were changed to stop civilian airliners flying over at any altitude. The question raised by the tragedy, but not explicitly framed in this report, is whether all civilian aircraft should have been banned at all altitudes, given the presence of powerful anti-aircraft missiles in the region. International aviation organisations have since set up a task force to review how restrictions are set, in light of the disaster. Kiev and the west have accused pro-Russia separatists of shooting down the plane with a surface-to-air missile supplied by Moscow. Russia, which denies mounting western claims of direct involvement in the five-month conflict in Ukraine, has blamed government forces for the attack.

On Monday the EU agreed new sanctions against Moscow, barring Russia&apos;s largest state-owned oil and defence firms from using European markets to raise capital and impose more asset freezes and travel bans on officials. It was the latest in successive waves of punitive measures since the downing of MH17, imposed because of Russian support for eastern Ukrainian separatists, but the new sanctions will only come into affect once the EU have assessed the implementation of the ceasefire.", "sentences": ["The findings are consistent with US and Ukrainian assertions the Boeing 777, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was brought down by an anti-aircraft missile, which they say was provided by Russia."], "title": "MH17 destroyed in instant by 'number of high-energy objects', says report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/09/mh17-destroyed-instant-high-energy-objects-report", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Ukraine", "Plane crashes", "Netherlands"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-10T08:00:06Z", "article": "Uefa have hamstrung their own tournament  So that\u2019s it then. After one match England have as good as qualified for Euro 2016. Their opening fixture was always likely to be the sternest test of a group comprising Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and San Marino and by comfortably beating Switzerland, Roy Hodgson\u2019s side passed it with flying colours, buying their manager some much-needed wriggle-room after their feeble showing in Brazil. With the top two sides due to qualify automatically from Group E and the third-placed side entering a play-off (although they could qualify automatically, too), it is utterly inconceivable that England will fail to go through against such feeble opposition. Of course while fans of the team ought to be pleased that their squad has secured such straightforward passage to Michel Platini\u2019s bloated new 24-team tournament, something resembling a bit of white-knuckle tension along the way wouldn\u2019t go amiss. Forthcoming qualifiers against San Marino (h), Estonia (a), Slovenia (h) and Lithuania (h) are unlikely to set too many pulses racing, even among the players, for whom extreme complacency is likely to be the only stumbling block as they canter to qualification in what should be a series of routine wins. They won\u2019t improve much, their paying public will be bored and once they get to France, the tournament\u2019s new format means they could qualify from whatever group they\u2019re in without winning a game. At some point these Euros will spark into life \u2013 but it\u2019s unlikely to happen until late June 2016. Well done, Uefa. Well done. BG Aiden McGeady comes of age for Ireland Despite his 70 appearances in an Ireland shirt, Irish football fans had never particularly warmed to Aiden McGeady before last weekend\u2019s heroics. The fact that he was born and reared in Scotland has absolutely nothing to do with it \u2013 as Ray Houghton remains a much-loved national treasure in his adopted football homeland, despite being as Scottish as Lough Ness, a Burns supper and that kilt-wearing piper on the shortbread tin. It\u2019s McGeady\u2019s frustrating lack of consistency and goals that have prevented the Irish from clasping him to the collective bosom, while his long spell off the British and Irish football radar as a player for Spartak Moscow probably didn\u2019t help either: out of sight, out of mind. Before Sunday\u2019s somewhat fortuitous win against Georgia, McGeady had scored only three goals in 69 appearances his country and was happy to concede that this dearth of goals was a major source of personal concern. Having featured in all three of Everton\u2019s Premier League matches this season and netted a sensational opening-day purler against Leicester, the 28-year-old came into Ireland\u2019s opening Euro qualifier in fine form and scored two goals, including one beauty borne from the trademark McGeady Spin, to win all three points. In one of very few tricky qualification groups that Germany should win doing cartwheels, one of Poland, Scotland and the Irish will suffer the ignominy of not even making it to a play-off for Euro 2016. Similarly helpful interventions from McGeady ought to ensure that it isn\u2019t Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s players who are left with heads hanging in shame. BG Spain secure services of Bar\u00e7a\u2019s latest prodigy At the age of 19, after only two starts and 125 competitive minutes for Barcelona and having played 90 senior minutes on only three occasions, all of them for Barcelona\u2019s second side in Spain\u2019s Segunda Divisi\u00f3n last season (all three games were in May, and Barcelona lost two of them), Munir El Haddadi made his debut for Spain in the 5-1 thrashing of Macedonia, replacing Koke in the 77th minute. To an extent this may have been a pragmatic move by Spain, securing for life the services of a promising youngster who might otherwise have chosen to represent Morocco, where his father was born (a procedure that is generally known as \u201cCarlJenkinsoning\u201d). Asked after the game the player insisted he never intended to represent any other country \u2013 \u201cSince I was young I have played in Spain and this was my idea. I spoke with people in Morocco and told them that I wanted to play here instead\u201d \u2013 but he could hardly be expected to express uncertainty in the circumstances. His father, an initially illegal immigrant who crossed the Strait of Gibraltar in a fishing boat aged 18 in search of a better life (he eventually became a chef and met Munir\u2019s mother at work, where she washed the dishes), suggested that there had been considerable doubt. \u201cMy son said to me, \u2018Father I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do,\u2019\u201d Mohammed El Haddadi told Radio Onda Cero. \u201cI told him to go with whoever calls you first. Spain called first and he went with them. If Morocco had called he would also have gone there. I\u2019ve always said to him it is whoever opens the door first.\u201d Before this week however Morocco hadn\u2019t so much opened the door as removed the entire wall of the house, going so far as to send Mohamed Ouzzine, their minister of sport, on a diplomatic mission to Barcelona last month to meet the player and his family (Mohammed apparently promised that his son was committed to the Atlas Lions). The skirmish is over, and Munir\u2019s international future is no longer in doubt. Only time will tell whether he was right to choose the 2010 World Cup champions and 2008 and 2012 double European Championship winners over rival suitors who last appeared at a World Cup when he was two. SB Zlatan Ibrahimovic is untouchable And in more ways than one, it seems. Fortunate to avoid celebrating his 100th appearance for Sweden with a red card for what looked suspiciously like an premeditated elbow on Austria\u2019s David Alaba during the 1-1 draw played out between the two nations, the striker also looked less than impressed with striker Rubin Okotie\u2019s meek attempts to lay hands on him while on defensive duties at a set piece. The Swede\u2019s contempt-tinged look of puzzled surprise spoke volumes. In a nutshell: you just don\u2019t touch the Zlatan. BG A lot done, more to do for Scotland Having identified and successfully attacked Germany\u2019s Erik Durm- and Sebastian Rudy-shaped weaknesses in the full-back positions, Gordon Strachan felt a mite aggrieved that his side did not leave Dortmund with a point few who watched the game would have begrudged them. After a ropey opening 20 minutes, the Scots acquitted themselves very well and their long-suffering fans have every right to genuinely fancy their chances of pipping the Republic of Ireland and Poland to automatic qualification from Group D. There is no disgrace in a narrow defeat away from home to the World Champions and prior to last weekend, Scotland had notched up some impressive results during Strachan\u2019s brief reign, beating Croatia at home and away in World Cup qualifying, as well as defeating Lithuania away. Sunday night\u2019s loss ended a six-match unbeaten run, albeit one where four of the games played were meaningless end-of-season friendlies. \u201cI actually could\u2019ve picked another team and it would\u2019ve given us the same performance,\u201d said Strachan afterwards. \u201cThat\u2019s how good our squad is getting.\u201d While it is not uncommon for Scotland to raise their game for matches against top-quality opposition such as Germany, it is their performances against Poland and Ireland that will reveal how far they\u2019ve come and how much further there is to go. BG Kyle Lafferty finally steps up In a week in which all five home nations gave good accounts of themselves (confession time: this bit was written before Wales played Andorra but we\u2019re guessing they didn\u2019t mess that up), perhaps the best result was Northern Ireland\u2019s 2-1 win against Hungary in Budapest, their first victory away from home in four years. An infuriating player who it seems is blessed with all the attributes of the stereotypical footballer apart from the ability to play football, Kyle Lafferty was the star turn, setting up one goal and scrambling home a second to seal his country\u2019s come-from-behind 2-1 win in the final nine minutes. As scores go it is unlikely to live long in the memory of anyone apart from the Norwich City striker but his delight upon securing three points for his team was obvious in the wake of a difficult year. Released by Palermo in June and described by the club president, Maurizio Zamparini, as \u201can out-of-control womaniser\u201d with a fondness for going on \u201cthe hunt for women in Milan\u201d, Lafferty was actually popular among Palermo fans and scored 11 goals in 34 Serie B matches as the club won promotion. Having been criticised for a lack of maturity on and off the field since his days at Rangers, Lafferty has yet to score for Norwich City this season, where manager Neil Adams appears to have marooned him out on the wing. However, his match-winning performance for Northern Ireland as an old fashioned, bustling centre-forward demonstrated where his talents lie. \u201cWe needed someone to step up and Laff did that for us, I\u2019m delighted for him,\u201d said Northern Ireland manager O\u2019Neill. \u201cFor the first goal he made a great run, a great piece of play. We needed something big to open the game up and Lafferty gave us that. Then he finds the winner as well. He gave us great energy all night but he needed that goal, he really did. When he\u2019s focused and he\u2019s right on it he\u2019s an asset to any team and he showed that here.\u201d Northern Ireland will struggle to qualify from a group containing Greece, Romania and Finland, but far stranger things have happened. A fit, in-form and focused \u201cIrishman without rules\u201d (\u00a9 Maurizio Zamparini) firing on all cylinders could make all the difference to their cause. BG Luxembourg\u2019s hot streak Other than Russia (who had 31 goal attempts in their 4-0 home win over Liechtenstein and still needed their opponents to score the first two goals for them \u2013 \u201cWe should have taken our chances,\u201d admitted the midfielder Aleksandr Samedov, \u201cbut we were helped by the fact they took our chances for us\u201d, no team in Europe had more chances than Belarus. Even Poland, who scored seven without reply in their Sunday stroll in Gibraltar, couldn\u2019t better the Belarusians when it comes to goal attempts. In all, Georgi Kondratiev\u2019s side mustered 29 efforts and the really galling thing is that they only scored one, and ended up drawing with Luxembourg, needing a 78th-minute equaliser even to get that. Equally painfully, of all the missed chances many thought that David Turpel or Mathias J\u00e4nisch came the closest to goal \u2013 and they\u2019re both Luxembourgeois. \u201cWe should have scored more goals with all the opportunities that we created,\u201d said Luc Holtz, the Luxembourg manager (which was rubbing it in a bit). The result (as well as the fact that May\u2019s 5-1 friendly defeat by Belgium was later declared void because there had been too many substitutions) means that Luxembourg are now unbeaten in three official Fifa-sanctioned matches, having also drawn against Cape Verde Islands and Italy. The last time that happened was in September 1995, when the third match in the series was, coincidentally, a home draw against Belarus. They\u2019re still a couple of games short of their all-time record hot streak, a five-match unbeaten run between 1961 and 1963 that included a 4-2 win over Portugal \u2013 Eusebio and all \u2013 a 2-1 away victory over Holland and home and away draws against the Danes that took them to the very verge of qualification for the 1964 European Championship (they eventually lost 1-0 to Denmark in a winner-takes-all neutral-venue replay, played in Amsterdam). Portuguese patience is wearing thin Following their fairly dismal showing in Brazil (P3 W1 D1 L1), Portugal got their qualification campaign for Euro 2016 off to the worst possible start, losing at home to Albania. Despite having to line up without Ronaldo, Portugal ought to have had more than enough about them to put their visitors away and their supporters are increasingly concerned that their prime asset, one of the greatest players in the world, is being wasted under the stewardship of Paulo Bento. The Portugal manager\u2019s strange team selections and apparently blind loyalty to certain favoured players such as Ricardo Costa, Miguel Veloso and Raul Meireles have long been a source of irritation in Portugal. Squandering the Ronaldo years as the player approaches his 30th birthday, through the use of antiquated tactics and past-their-prime personnel as his team-mates, would be little short of scandalous. Portugal fans were understandably vocal in their criticism of Bento in the immediate aftermath of this upset and while their team should still qualify for what could be Ronaldo\u2019s last major international tournament, it seems unlikely they will do so with their current manager in charge. BG Andorrans famous for frustration The manner of Wales\u2019s win in Andorra might not have been enormously encouraging but it is not as if they are alone in finding the part-timers of the principality surprisingly hard to break down. The game brought back not enormously welcome memories of England\u2019s two trips to the principality, both of which saw the visitors grow frustrated (they were goalless at half-time) before eventually prevailing, and going on to qualify for whatever it was they were trying to qualify for (it doesn\u2019t just happen to the British \u2013 when the Dutch visited last September needing a win to secure qualification for the Brazil World Cup they toiled until the 50th minute, scored twice in short order and then continued to struggle for the rest of the game). Other than a reminder of Gareth Bale\u2019s priceless qualities, the real encouragement for the Welsh last night came in Zenica where Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2013 the team Wales will most likely have to pip to second place behind presumed group winners Belgium if they are to qualify without recourse to a play-off \u2013 slipped to defeat to Cyprus. Both those sides must visit Cardiff next month, after which the picture might start to become a little clearer. SB Meanwhile in Africa ... Qualification for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations continued with another 14 fixtures. The 30th edition of the tournament will be played from 17 January through to 8 February in Morocco next year, which ought to prompt the usual chorus of moaning from assorted managers who\u2019d either forgotten about or were completely unaware of it, when they signed players who were likely to be competing. Everton fans will be pleased to hear that Samuel Eto\u2019o has once again announced his retirement from the Cameroon squad, although history suggests he may very well review his decision if they qualify.

The All 4 initiative forms the next stage of Channel 4 chief executive David Abraham\u2019s plan to keep connected with the broadcaster\u2019s youth audience, for which advertisers pay a premium, which is drifting from traditional TV to digital. \u201cWe believe All 4 will deliver the most advanced broadcaster response to changing viewer behaviour in the digital age,\u201d said Abraham, who will unveil the initiative in a keynote speech at the IBC conference in Amsterdam on Thursday. \u201cIt will help ensure that our content portfolio remains an important, valued part of viewers\u2019 TV consumption for decades to come.\u201d Channel 4 claims to have signed up 50% of all 16- to 34-year-olds in the UK to Channel4.com.     David Abraham, Channel 4\u2019s CEO, says All 4 is the most advanced response by a broadcaster to changing behaviour by viewers. Photograph: Rob McDougall/Guardian Edinburgh/PA    The new All 4 website will have three main sections. The Now section will be where viewers can watch live streaming of all Channel 4 TV services, including the main network, E4, More4 and Film4. A newly-overhauled on-demand section will replace 4oD and host all of the broadcaster\u2019s catch up TV content, as well as features such as cast interviews. The On Soon section will showcase new programme clips and promos, and allow viewers to set reminders and alerts. Channel 4\u2019s new Shorts initiative, commissioning a range of bite-size programmes for the web featuring talent including Jamie Oliver and Made in Chelsea\u2019s Binky Felstead, will be made available across all three sections as well as in its own dedicated hub. The new strategy comes months after Channel 4 moved to strip full-length programmes from its YouTube channels to focus on attracting viewers to, and better monetising, its own Channel 4.com site. Channel 4 says its online revenues have tripled over the last five years. \u201cWe want to evolve our digital estate to reinforce the online association with our linear channel brands and to provide a broader range of content experiences in an increasingly personalised manner,\u201d said Keith Underwood, director of strategy and technology at Channel 4. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

At the Olympic Stadium, walking around an arena that has been taken over for the day by his Foundation, this is an exercise in the familiar art of being Johan Cruyff. The 67-year-old reacts to the adoration, and even being\u00a0cuddled by a grown man dressed up as a \u201cCruyffie\u201d mascot, with a wry smile. This is how it feels to have been a football superstar for five decades. Alongside his earliest hero Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, who died this summer, Pel\u00e9 and Diego Maradona, Cruyff belongs to a giant quartet who illuminate football with their almost mythic reputations. Cruyff stands out in even sharper relief for, while Di St\u00e9fano succeeded as a coach, only the Dutchman can claim a sustained impact on the game from the touchline during his years in charge of Barcelona. Di St\u00e9fano once complained of football management that \u201capart from working with the young, it\u2019s the most horrible profession that could exist\u201d. Cruyff has always thought differently. During his remarkable tenure at Barcelona, from 1988 to 1996, he used the speed, space and tactical fluidity of Total Football, which he and Rinus Michels, his coach at Ajax, conjured up together, to transform a moribund team and build an enduring legacy. Barcelona\u2019s masters of tiki-taka, such as Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, always stressed everything they did was based on the Cruyff template. From his creation of the youth academy at La Masia to the whirligig of training rondos [piggy-in-the-middle routines], which perfected their purity of possession, to the relentless pressing of the opposition, Barcelona and Spain used Cruyff\u2019s model to dominate European and world football. That era has faded, reaching its symbolic end on a World Cup night in June when Holland, coached by Louis van Gaal, with whom Cruyff shares a mutual antipathy, destroyed Spain 5-1. Of course Van Gaal is now at Manchester United, struggling to overcome the problems of the post-Ferguson regime, while Cruyff is unshackled from the pressures of football. The life of Cruyff is still exhausting \u2013 and he explains wearily he has to fly back to Barcelona, his other \u201chome\u201d, that night. Yet, right now, being Van Gaal is much more difficult. We retreat to a secluded lounge overlooking a typical Amsterdam canal. Cruyff, who is friendly and animated but reluctant to start another war with Van Gaal, with whom he has admitted to \u201ca bad chemistry\u201d, can afford to take a laconic view of his fellow Dutchman\u2019s travails. Asked if he expects Van Gaal to succeed at Old Trafford, Cruyff shrugs. \u201cWe hope so because it would be good for Dutch football and other Dutch managers. But how it will go? You never know. It will take time.\u201d In 2011 Cruyff, who was then on the board at Ajax, went to court to block the re-appointment of Van Gaal at the club they supported as boys. They were also part of the Ajax squad in the early 1970s when, as his understudy, Van Gaal had no chance of replacing Cruyff as the star forward. Cruyff established himself as the finest player in Europe while Van Gaal laboured in relative obscurity at clubs such as Royal Antwerp and Sparta Rotterdam.     Children show off their skills at the annual Open Day of the Johan Cruyff Foundation at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam. Photograph: Niels den Haan for the Guardian    When Cruyff moved into coaching, at Ajax and Barcelona, Van Gaal eventually followed him to both clubs. The younger man, by four years, found his true self in management and he emerged as head coach at Ajax in 1991. Cruyff and Van Gaal were already rumoured to have become further estranged \u2013 apparently after a misunderstanding at a Christmas dinner in 1989. The rivalry resurfaced three years ago when the Ajax board appeared to wait until Cruyff was back in Barcelona to call a meeting that approved Van Gaal\u2019s return. Cruyff resorted to legal means to challenge that decision. In the end, despite the court ruling against Cruyff, Van Gaal never made it back to Ajax. Instead, in 2012, he became Holland\u2019s manager. So Cruyff pauses when asked again for his gut feeling in regard to Van Gaal\u2019s prospects with United. \u201cI don\u2019t know because they almost bought and created a new team. So now you have to fix it together \u2013 the team itself. It\u2019s not a question anymore about the quality of the players, or are they good enough. But to make a mixture of good players is very difficult.\u201d Does he see any logic in United\u2019s transfer policy, which now has Van Gaal juggling the attacking talents of Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda, Adnan Januzaj and Juan Mata? \u201cThere should be a logic always, but the big problem is to manage all these players. It\u2019s the same thing with Barcelona. They now have Su\u00e1rez, Messi, Neymar \u2013 how do you play them together? If you see them individually then they are great players. It\u2019s the same at Manchester United. Individually they are great but they have to play like a team. \u201cThen you get another problem. They are all famous. They earn a lot of money both on and off the field. How can you create a team and bring all these egos together? The main goal for Manchester United is for them to play well \u2013 and not have a player saying, \u2018I play well, I scored two goals\u2019. Because if I score two goals but three goals go into our net then we lose. They provide [Van Gaal] with a lot of good players but he has to turn them into a team. And you can\u2019t arrange the chemistry of the team in two weeks. It needs time.\u201d Could it take Van Gaal a whole season to transform United\u2019s seemingly scattergun transfer business into a coherent team? \u201cNo, no,\u201d Cruyff says. \u201cThat\u2019s too long. But it doesn\u2019t mean they will win the league. But you can see a better performance every week and you can aim for a better fit as a team in the details. And [Van Gaal] is a person of details. So it could be possible that things work. But, once again, can these people develop their own game for the sake of the team? It\u2019s not easy.\u201d Do he and Van Gaal share any similarities in their respective football philosophies? \u201cNo. Not much. We\u2019re both Dutch and that is always a [shared] basis. But I always think of being in charge of the speed and of the ball. Maybe he knows more than me but I always want control of the ball. When I don\u2019t have control of the ball what do I do? I press to get it back. It\u2019s a way of defending. But more important is that I like to have the ball.\u201d     Johan Cruyff plays a game of tennis on the annual Open Day of the Johan Cruyff Foundation. Photograph: Niels den Haan for the Guardian    Cruyff has said: \u201cVan Gaal has a good vision of football but it is not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I want individuals to think for themselves.\u201d Does Van Gaal remain \u201cmilitaristic\u201d in his stress of \u201cthe collective\u201d? Cruyff nods. \u201cYes. But I\u2019ve always been an individual who likes to create something himself within a team performance. I am happy if my players start thinking. [Pep] Guardiola is a good example. As a player he was tactically perfect but he can\u2019t defend. That\u2019s what he said. I said: \u2018I agree \u2013 in a limited way. You\u2019re a bad defender if you have to cover this whole area. But if you have to defend this one small area then I think you\u2019re the best. Take care that there are people there to help you cover the other areas. As long as you do that you can be a very good defender.\u2019 And he did become very good.\u201d He has also criticised Van Gaal\u2019s supposed reluctance to focus on training individual players \u2013 and he reiterates this point. \u201cThat\u2019s why I believe in individual coaching sessions to prepare players properly. You have to take care of the individual for the benefit of the team \u2013 as our work with Guardiola showed.\u201d Guardiola became one of Cruyff\u2019s disciples and eventual successors as Barcelona manager before he took a sabbatical and then moved to Bayern Munich last year. Cruyff admits his admiration for Bayern but, at the same time, \u201cI still like Bar\u00e7a very much. I also like Madrid. It\u2019s totally different to my style but they fit things together. Now they are a team where you wait to see what will happen. In midfield they have three players who are touching the ball perfectly but they have three forwards who need space to play. Where will it go? We will see. Bar\u00e7a also went back a little because of the people they put as coaches. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re good or bad coaches but it\u2019s very difficult to control a Messi and a Neymar. If you don\u2019t control them it\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s the same thing with David Moyes and Manchester United. Some people can control certain players and you need that \u2013 otherwise it will not work. Moyes is a good coach \u2013 just not for Man United.\u201d Cruyff shakes his head and moves on to a different tangent. \u201cFootball is now all about money. There are problems with the values within the game. And this is sad because football is the most beautiful game. We can play it in the street. We can play it everywhere. Everyone can play it but those values are being lost. We have to bring them back.\u201d Does he believe that the situation in England, where the Premier League swamps the development of the national game, in contrast to the Bundesliga and Germany, will change? \u201cHopefully,\u201d Cruyff says. \u201cIn the Premier League the money is a problem but I don\u2019t really know how to control it. If you look at England or even Spain you see the problems. How many England players are in the first four teams in the Premier League? How many Spanish forwards are playing for Barcelona or Real Madrid?\u201d     Johan Cruyff signs autographs. In November it will be 50 years since he made his debut for Ajax. Photograph: Niels den Haan for the Guardian    We talk a couple days after Roy Hodgson\u2019s team impressed in a 2-0 defeat of Switzerland but Cruyff\u2019s wider point about the stymied development of young English players, and even their Spanish counterparts at the peak of La Liga, remain pertinent. And it seems poignant that, back home in Amsterdam, Cruyff should mention the English coaches who helped him emerge at Ajax in the early 1960s. \u201cI think of Vic Buckingham who picked me [for Cruyff\u2019s Ajax debut in November 1964]. But even before Vic [who coached Cruyff at Ajax and Barcelona] there was Keith Spurgeon. He\u2019s not famous but he was one of my first coaches. I learned my English from Keith Spurgeon. He had some small children and I was young too and so we spoke the language together and it was fantastic.\u201d English coaches are not usually known for their tactical innovations \u2013 so were Spurgeon and Buckingham more open-minded than their successors? \u201cThey were open-minded but, tactically, you have to see where we were at that time. Football in Holland then was good but it was not really professional. They gave us some professionalism because they were much further down the road. But the tactical thinking came later with Michels. It started then.\u201d Cruyff turned Michels\u2019s vision into a practical reality, especially at Barcelona, but it is striking how he seems even more proud of his work with the foundation that bears his name. After a day in which he has devoted himself to the cause of helping disabled children develop through playing various sports, Cruyff says simply: \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. And the crazy thing is that it gives you more. I am trying to help them but they are helping me too. The president of the Paralympics once told me the difference between able-bodied and disabled people. He said: \u2018Disabled people don\u2019t think about what they don\u2019t have. They just think about what they do have.\u2019 If only we could all learn to think like this. \u201cWe have our institute with a lot of young people who can help out their federations and clubs and sports. It\u2019s fantastic to see this happen because they always surprise me. If you see what they can do and how they can develop as a person you learn so many things.\u201d The old footballer appears to share Di St\u00e9fano\u2019s pleasures in the consolations of \u201cworking with the young\u201d. And, with his own legacy as a player and coach enshrined, Cruyff can watch Van Gaal from a detached distance \u2013 and wonder whether his rival might still succumb, even fleetingly, to Di St\u00e9fano\u2019s more searing belief that football management is \u201cthe most horrible profession that could exist\u201d. Cruyff appears even more interested in how Guardiola will fare in his second season at Bayern. He steered the champions to a runaway defence of their Bundesliga title \u2013 but they could not retain the Champions League trophy they had won under Jupp Heynckes in 2013. But Cruyff sees the best tenets of his philosophy within Guardiola. \u201cYes, he\u2019s got it. Normally I would say that the most important thing for a coach is that he [overcame] difficulties when he was young. Look at Guardiola and myself. Like me he was very thin and he had to take care of his technique. You see it with Iniesta and Messi too. They must do something quick otherwise they will never get there. It means that they are aware of all the details. You have to think quicker and see more things. And if you see more things you can help more people.\u201d Cruyff looks across the old Olympic arena in Amsterdam and, with a familiar shrug, he says, finally: \u201cIt\u2019s like everything in football \u2013 and life. You need to look, you need to think, you need to move, you need to find space, you need to help others. It\u2019s very simple in the end.\u201d For more information on Johan Cruyff&apos;s Foundation and other initiatives visit www.cruyff-foundation.org, www.cruyffinstitute.org and www.johancruyff.com", "sentences": ["Johan Cruyff has come home to Amsterdam and, on a cloudy day in the old city where he was born, grew up and made his professional debut for Ajax 50 years ago this November, he moves with good-humoured elegance through the crowds calling out his name and trying to touch him.", "We retreat to a secluded lounge overlooking a typical Amsterdam canal.", "Children show off their skills at the annual Open Day of the Johan Cruyff Foundation at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam.", "And it seems poignant that, back home in Amsterdam, Cruyff should mention the English coaches who helped him emerge at Ajax in the early 1960s.", "And if you see more things you can help more people.\u201d Cruyff looks across the old Olympic arena in Amsterdam and, with a familiar shrug, he says, finally: \u201cIt\u2019s like everything in football \u2013 and life."], "title": "Johan Cruyff: 'Everyone can play football but those values are being lost.

They are time efficient, environmentally sustainable, and irresistibly romantic: you go to sleep in one country and wake up in another, possibly having made friends along the way. In public at least, Europe&apos;s politicians and railway companies agree: in December 2009, many of them ceremonially boarded a specially commissioned &quot;Climate Express&quot; from Brussels to the UN climate summit in Copenhagen. Yet five years later, sleeper trains are being silently phased out across the continent, while countries elsewhere in the world are modernising their services. Deutsche Bahn, the German rail provider, confirmed this month that its City Night Line sleeper trains on the Climate Express route would cease from 1 November, while the night train that connects Paris to Berlin, Hamburg and Munich will be stopped from December. The Amsterdam to Prague and Warsaw sleeper will be cut back to run from Cologne to Warsaw and Prague.     A passenger sleeps in a train stationed at Augsburg's railway station, Germany. Photograph: Afp/AFP/Getty Images    The Elipsos night train from Paris to Barcelona and Madrid \u2013 launched in 1969 with ground-breaking technology, allowing carriages to switch between multiple track gauges \u2013 was discontinued in December. Thello, a joint venture between Trenitalia and France-based Transdev, in December scrapped its sleeper train between Rome and Paris, the continent&apos;s most romantic capitals. Passengers now have to make at least one change en route, usually at Turin or Milan. Services from Berlin to Warsaw and Kiev, as well as the weekly Sibirjak service to Siberia, have also been withdrawn recently. &quot;The EU is professing its investment in rail services,&quot; Mark Smith, who runs the award-winning Man on Seat 61 railway blog, told the Guardian. &quot;But, in reality, it seems to be actually shifting traffic to the airways.&quot; German rail services cite declining passenger numbers, caused by the rise of low-budget airlines, as the main reason for phasing out services. A spokesperson from Die Bahn said its night-train customers had fallen by 25% over the past five years, while its three least profitable sleeper lines had turned a loss of \u20ac12m. Julio G\u00f3mez-Pomar, the president of Renfe, Spain&apos;s state-owned company which operates freight and passenger trains, has said that some of its night services had been cut because they were circulating with empty coaches. A spokesperson for Trenitalia, which has in recent years reduced the number of domestic sleepers connecting the south of the country to the north, said: &quot;In the last 10 years there has been a reduction in night-train services, both in terms of the public resources earmarked for their running and because of the gradual decrease in their use, which has suffered a big decline connected to the arrival of low-cost flights, competition from coaches and the launch of the high-speed network.&quot;     A cabin and corridor of a Thello train, of French Veolia Transdev and Italian Threnitalia. Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images    Sleeper trains are undoubtedly more expensive to run than day services. For a start, they hold fewer passengers: a typical sleeper carriage carries 36 people, as opposed to 70 on a seating-only train. In addition, since 2000 train services have had to pay track access charges as they cross borders, with additional administration and negotiations required to work out precise costs. In Germany, train companies further complain that they are burdened by eco taxes and VAT on ticket sales from which airline operators are exempt. Yet campaigners, many of whom rely on sleeper services as they choose not to fly for environmental reasons or cannot do so on health grounds, claim that rail providers&apos; complaints about declining passenger figures are a self-fulfilling prophecy. Since train companies have for years failed to invest in more comfortable carriages, overnight train journeys have for many lost their appeal. When the Paris to Berlin sleeper was launched in 2000, it had a dining car and onboard chef. These days, passengers on the same route can only buy microwave meals to eat on their laps. While plane tickets can be bought cheaply months in advance, night train schedules are often changed at short notice due to overnight engineering works. Loco2, a UK booking agency for pan-European rail journeys, said it had seen a lot of demand for night trains, but was allowed by Deutsche Bahn to sell tickets only for its day services. &quot;There&apos;s no basis to the argument that sleeper trains are outmoded per se,&quot; said blogger Jon Worth, who has launched a petition to save the Copenhagen night train. Britain has announced upgrades to its Caledonian and London-Penzance sleeper services, while China and Russia have invested in new night-train carriages, he pointed out. &quot;Railways are still the most environmentally sustainable and comfortable way of getting around Europe. You cannot expect people to spend a day on a train \u2013 you can expect them to spend a night.&quot; Additional reporting by Lizzy Davies in Rome, Ashifa Kassam in Madrid and Kim Willsher in Paris", "sentences": ["The Amsterdam to Prague and Warsaw sleeper will be cut back to run from Cologne to Warsaw and Prague."], "title": "End of the line for Europe's iconic night trains?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/12/europe-night-trains-sleeper-service", "tags": ["Rail transport", "Rail fares", "Consumer affairs", "Transport policy", "Transport", "Money", "Rail transport", "UK news", "World news", "Rail travel", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-13T23:05:10Z", "article": "The Germans \u2013 as always \u2013 have a great word for it: kompromisslosigkeit. It translates as \u201ca refusal to make compromises\u201d and it is one quality, Malin Elmlid believes, that all great bakers share. She saw it in Tartine Bakery\u2019s Chad Robertson, the San Francisco-based guru of sourdough, and in a group of local women in Kabul, Afghanistan. Kompromisslosigkeit is a recurring feature throughout Elmlid\u2019s new book, The Bread Exchange, which is an exotic travelogue, sociological experiment and collection of recipes \u2013 as well as a testament to the unifying global power of the staff of life. And Elmlid, a 34-year-old Swede who now lives in Berlin, clearly has a streak of kompromisslosigkeit herself. She set her alarm for 5am to pummel a wodge of dough so it would have the perfect elasticity for a photo shoot. When I suggest her commitment may not be obvious in the published pictures, she looks back with pity and confusion. No matter, too, that \u2013 because Elmlid is on the road \u2013 she has no way of actually baking the dough she has been diligently nurturing for the last three days. \u201cI feel bad I don\u2019t have any bread for you,\u201d says Elmlid, taking a seat at Caravan restaurant in King\u2019s Cross. There are three of us at the table: Elmlid, myself and a jar of suppurating sourdough starter, which travels most places with her and which she sometimes refers to as \u201che\u201d. \u201cHe is very \u2026\u201d she laughs, \u201csorry, it is very well-behaved, it can be weeks in the fridge.\u201d     Bread and salmon. Photograph: Malin Elmlid    Before the Bread Exchange was a website and then a book, it was a manifesto. In 2007, Elmlid started making her own sourdough, mostly as a relief from her day job in the fashion industry. She quickly grew more serious and skilled, and her apartment became full of more bread than she knew what to do with. A friend-of-a-friend of hers received a loaf in 2009 and as a thank you offered Elmlid a spare ticket to a concert by the Berlin Philharmonic. She started to wonder what else she might swap for bread. Five years on, Elmlid has made more than 1,400 trades in more than a dozen countries: in reciprocation, she has had her bicycle fixed and taken guitar lessons; she has bartered bread for two kilos of quince and a handmade suitcase from Alstermo Bruk. Money has never changed hands. The motto of the project became: \u201cEverything is not for sale.\u201d A simple idea has fired the imagination of many people in ways Elmlid didn\u2019t expect \u2013 and never intended. As she explains in the book\u2019s introduction: \u201cI didn\u2019t start the project for any of the obvious DIY reasons, or because of the economic crisis in 2008; it wasn\u2019t inspired by religion and it wasn\u2019t a backlash against our consumer society.\u201d Elmlid did not want to change the world then, but what were her hopes for the Bread Exchange? \u201cIt\u2019s not a hippie idea,\u201d she says. \u201cI am someone who is very curious about people and small details. This was a way of combining those things in a very natural situation, without anyone feeling screwed. Without money, people get to be honest.\u201d Bread, Elmlid insists, has been crucial: its value is recognised by all strata of society worldwide.\u201cBread looks different in every culture, but it exists in every culture and often plays a very large role in people\u2019s lives,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople without money understand bread and even people who are rich sometimes can\u2019t get it \u2013 a place like Berlin, for example \u2013 because quality bread is so rare.\u201d Elmlid may have had modest ambitions, but the project might be quietly revolutionary. The cover of her book hints at a lifestyle that is glossy and untouchably idyllic, but delve into Elmlid\u2019s experiences \u2013 just one or two unsatisfactory trades in more than five years \u2013 and a reader might develop a surprisingly warm picture of human nature. Might we all be a little happier if we were prepared to give without knowing what we would get in return?     Malin baking in Kabul.

The Swedish mentality, at least when I grew up, was, \u2018Don\u2019t be too good. Don\u2019t stick out too much.\u2019 I\u2019m not brought up to take risks at all.\u201d She was born in the remote north of the country, in Sjungande Dalen, the \u201csinging river valley\u201d.

On midsommar night, she would \u2013 as tradition dictates \u2013 pick seven flowers, jump seven wooden fences and go to bed with the petals on her pillow, assured she would dream of the person she would eventually marry. But Elmlid was always a little rebellious. Aged 16, she nagged her parents to let her study in America and she ended up for a year at high school in Columbus, Ohio. After university, she went hitchhiking: going through Kenya and Tanzania; from Berlin to the lakes in northern Italy; from Stockholm to Amsterdam in the cabs of trucks. Naturally, she didn\u2019t tell her cautious, very Swedish parents about any of these adventures. These stories suggest an appetite for risk, but Elmlid demurs at this interpretation. \u201cWhen I was hitchhiking, I would not stand on the street,\u201d she says. \u201cI would make sure I was at a gas station where you can see people and sense what they\u2019re like. You have to trust your gut feeling, because not everyone is out to be nice. And I would not hitchhike now.\u201d Elmlid is certainly much more pragmatic than one might expect an avowed barterer to be. Her degree was in business studies and, until she quit recently to work full time on the book, she was a sales manager for fashion labels including the Danish brand Wood Wood and Levi\u2019s Vintage. If anything, Elmlid\u2019s experiences doing the Bread Exchange have made her more appreciative of the benefits of a conventional economy. \u201cIt\u2019s not interesting to me to be a missionary for a new system or attitude to life. Money is great, because money makes us anonymous. What I have really learned is that you don\u2019t want to trade with everyone. It is extremely time-consuming and you definitely don\u2019t want that connection with everyone \u2013 that\u2019s just how it is. I have been extremely lucky and in the future I wish I could make 10% of my purchases in exchanges. Then I think I would get something more out of life.\u201d When Elmlid started the Bread Exchange, she appealed for people to swap anything they didn\u2019t need. This led to some confusing \u2013 and a couple of underwhelming \u2013 trades, so she refined the criteria to encourage items \u201cmade with dedication\u201d or \u201cbought with good intentions\u201d. After that, she found the exchanges became consistently thoughtful and often serendipitous. A South Korean woman gave her edible charcoal powder and one day Elmlid mixed it with vodka and added it to her sourdough mix: the dramatically black Bread Exchange signature loaf was born. A project that began in Elmlid\u2019s Berlin kitchen has now taken her across the world. She went to Kabul in the spring of 2013 with her then boyfriend, a foreign correspondent for Der Spiegel, and found she\u2019d \u201cnever visited a country where bread played a larger role\u201d. Her hope was to show that, even ravaged by conflict, some aspects of daily life \u2013 \u201ceating, baking bread, sleeping, making jokes and falling in love\u201d \u2013 continue to take place. \u201cWar doesn\u2019t stop everyone from living,\u201d Elmlid notes, \u201cit just raises the stakes of daily life.\u201d On her arrival at the Serena Hotel in Kabul, Elmlid\u2019s bread knife was confiscated and she was given a \u201cweapons voucher\u201d to recover it on her departure; in March 2014, a year to the day that she stayed there, a Taliban attack on the hotel resulted in the death of 13 people, including four gunmen. Elmlid, however, was able to get revealing access to a female-only nanwaee, or bakery, where women cook the dough in scorching tandoor fires \u2013 and then hang around gossiping. \u201cBread is a very friendly thing to have with you,\u201d says Elmlid. Elmlid maintains that the principal lesson she has taken from the Bread Exchange is to give without expecting anything in return. \u201cYou stay happier longer if you think that way,\u201d she says. \u201cHow painful is it when you are expecting stuff and you don\u2019t get it? It\u2019s all going to come if you are nice, and the people who do not return it to you, cut them out. It\u2019s very easy.\u201d With that, we part, and Elmlid heads towards the kitchen at Caravan to ask if she can borrow their oven to bake her dough.

In a statement intended to quell press speculation, Heineken confirmed it had been approached by London-listed SABMiller, the world&apos;s second-largest brewer, but said the proposal was &quot;non-actionable&quot;. &quot;The Heineken family has informed SABMiller \u2026 of its intention to preserve the heritage and identity of Heineken as an independent company,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The Heineken family and Heineken NV&apos;s management are confident that the company will continue to deliver growth and shareholder value.&quot; The Heineken family owns a controlling stake of just over 50% of the brewery, with the remainder split between shareholders on the Amsterdam stock exchange and Femsa, the Latin American drinks company, which is the world&apos;s largest bottler of Coca Cola. Heineken, which owns Kronenbourg, Sol and John Smith&apos;s as well as its namesake beer, traces its roots back to a single Amsterdam brewery bought in 1864. SABMiller has Coors, Grolsch and Peroni in its stable of brands, and was keen to buy up Heineken to protect itself from a takeover bid from the world&apos;s largest brewer, Belgium-based AB InBev. &quot;For SAB, a way of preserving their independence is to buy Heineken,&quot; Matthew Beesley of Henderson Global Investors told Bloomberg. &quot;It&apos;s easy to underestimate the desire for management teams to be in control of their own destiny rather than to sell their business at a very high price.&quot; Rumours have been swirling for months that SABMiller was planning to bid for its smaller Dutch rival, but the Heineken family felt forced to act after media reports of an offer. SABMiller, with annual revenues of \u00a320.9bn and net profits of \u00a32.9bn is the bigger player, compared to Heineken, the world&apos;s third-largest brewer by volume, which has revenues of \u00a315bn and earned \u00a31.1bn) net profits in its last financial year.

Bathed in red and white lights and cheered on by a capacity audience of about 1,500 at the Auckland town hall, the internet entrepreneur turned political party founder sat alongside journalist Glenn Greenwald at a table emblazoned, in case there was any doubt, with the words the Moment of Truth. On the big screen above, Greenwald&apos;s source, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, was beamed in live from Moscow, while fellow fugitive Julian Assange peered from a screen beside him, also beamed in live from the Ecuadorian embassy in London. All were given thundering ovations from a crowd who, five days away from New Zealand&apos;s general election, were energised by articles published hours earlier by Greenwald and Snowden alleging mass surveillance in New Zealand and duplicity on the part of the prime minister, John Key. Greenwald, whose arrival in New Zealand on Friday ignited another powder keg in an already explosive election campaign, began by marvelling at the criticisms he has faced from Key, who has labelled him &quot;Dotcom&apos;s little henchman&quot; and a loser. &quot;It is not all that common to arrive in a country, and within 24 hours, literally, find oneself being publicly maligned and attacked by the nation&apos;s head of state, using the most adolescent epithets imaginable,&quot; said Greenwald to applause, and peals of laughter from Dotcom. He dismissed Key&apos;s claim of political motives as &quot;reckless accusations&quot;. Key has repeatedly rubbished Greenwald&apos;s claims of mass surveillance by the New Zealand spy agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau, a member of the NSA-led Five Eyes alliance, saying that while the government had considered a programme for &quot;mass protection&quot;, he had rejected the GCSB proposal. Within hours of Greenwald and Snowden&apos;s articles being published on the Intercept website \u2013 drawing on NSA documents that detailed a programme called Speargun, which involved a &quot;cable access&quot; tap, apparently into the undersea cable that connects the New Zealand internet to the world \u2013 Key had responded by releasing declassified documents which proved, he said, that the claims were &quot;simply wrong&quot; and &quot;based on incomplete information&quot;. Greenwald hit back with an express-pace address at the town hall. &quot;He&apos;s not releasing that classified information for any other reason than protecting his reputation and for political gain,&quot; he said. Retracing the evidence in the Intercept report and an accompanying article by Snowden, Greenwald said: &quot;The Key government has radically misled and deceived the New Zealand citizenry. I don&apos;t make that accusation lightly\u00a0\u2026 unless I have the evidence to back it up. And in this case I can categorically and with great confidence say that it is.&quot; The biggest roar of the night greeted the arrival on the big screen of Snowden, white earphones dangling from his ears. His contribution, the most compelling of the night, began with a new piece of information: the NSA had a facility somewhere in Auckland, and another further north. As to Key&apos;s denials, Snowden detected a &quot;careful parsing of words&quot;. His own experience as an NSA analyst, he said, left him with no doubt that New Zealanders&apos; communications were swept up by the XKeyScore mass surveillance programme. &quot;Maybe the people of New Zealand think that&apos;s appropriate,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe they think that they want to sacrifice a certain measure of their liberty\u00a0\u2026 That&apos;s what democracy is about; that&apos;s what self-government is about. But that decision doesn&apos;t belong to John Key or officials in the GCSB making these decisions behind closed doors.&quot; Next came Assange. The WikiLeaks founder first apologised for the background noise of mysterious tunnelling \u2013 building works were under way in the flat below the embassy. He went on to lay out the &quot;wider context&quot; for the spying revelations: New Zealand had been &quot;effectively annexed&quot;, he said, a tired voice competing with the incessant hammering of a power tool. Dotcom, who is wanted in the US for alleged copyright infringements around his now defunct Megaupload site, lavished praise on his guests. &quot;You are heroes and I thank you very much for letting humanity know what is going on,&quot; he enthused. There was no &quot;moment of truth&quot; from Dotcom, however. The Internet party&apos;s founder and &quot;visionary&quot; \u2013 as a non-citizen resident he is prohibited from standing for parliament \u2013 had promised to produce evidence to support his belief that Key had colluded with Hollywood executives to deny him residency in New Zealand in 2010, in preparation for an extradition attempt to the US. Key has consistently said he knew nothing of Dotcom&apos;s existence until the eve of the dramatic FBI-backed raid on his north Auckland mansion in January 2012. The anticipated &quot;big reveal&quot; had been published in the New Zealand Herald several hours before the town hall extravaganza. It came in the form of a purported email from 2010, in which the Warner Bros chairman informed a Motion Picture Association of America executive: &quot;John Key told me in private that they are granting Dotcom residency despite pushback from officials about his criminal past. His AG [attorney general] will do everything in his power to assist us with our case. VIP treatment and then a one-way ticket to Virginia [where charges would be filed].&quot; The email which, according to the Herald, was &quot;the evidence Dotcom is planning on producing at the Moment of Truth event&quot;, was quickly dismissed as a fake by Warner Bros and the MPAA, while Key said no such conversation took place. The disputed email was mentioned only fleetingly during the Monday night rally by lawyer Robert Amsterdam, who said it had been referred to the parliamentary privileges committee. However it dominated a heated press conference afterwards. Attempts to prevent discussion of the disputed email on the basis it would be the subject of an inquiry were scoffed at by journalists seeking information on its provenance and authenticity. Greenwald was largely a bystander as Dotcom responded to questions by chiding the media: &quot;You have failed us in the past. You need to wake up and do your jobs.&quot; Dotcom insisted the email was genuine. &quot;I believe it to be 100% real,&quot; he said. &quot;Everything I&apos;ve produced in the past, everything I&apos;ve said in the past, has been proved true.&quot; He may need to produce proof promptly if he wants to dent Key&apos;s chances of surviving Saturday&apos;s election.", "sentences": ["The disputed email was mentioned only fleetingly during the Monday night rally by lawyer Robert Amsterdam, who said it had been referred to the parliamentary privileges committee."], "title": "Greenwald, Dotcom, Snowden and Assange take on 'adolescent' John Key", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/15/moment-truth-greenwald-dotcom-snowden-assange-new-zealand-john-key", "tags": ["New Zealand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Dotcom", "Technology", "Edward Snowden", "Espionage", "Surveillance"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-15T15:40:09Z", "article": "An American citizen, who has been missing inside the prison system of Yemen for seven months, has made contact with his wife in a furtive phone call during which he alleged that his US-allied captors are torturing him and may kill him. Sharif Mobley, 30, whose lawyers consider him to be disappeared, managed to call his wife in Philadelphia on Thursday, the first time they had spoken since February and a rare independent proof he is alive since a brief phone call with his mother in July. In the 10-minute call with Nzinga Islam, which she believes was not sanctioned by his jailers, Mobley pleaded to see his lawyer and said he was being physically abused. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m being tortured.\u2019 He even said, \u2018They\u2019re gonna kill me in here,\u2019\u201d Islam said. In a whispered tone, Mobley reported that his captors are \u201cspraying gas into my eyes,\u201d insufficiently feeding him, and forcing him to drink water out of bottles that had contained urine, Islam said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t seen his lawyer, they\u2019re not allowing anyone to see him,\u201d she told the Guardian in a rare interview. Islam, 26, said she believes her husband was permitted to call her thanks to a sympathetic guard. Addressing a central mystery in Mobley\u2019s ordeal, a voice Islam believes belonged to the guard said they were on a military base on Haddah Street in Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana\u2019a. Reprieve, an international human rights group representing Mobley, said it believes the base is used by the Central Security Forces, one of Yemen\u2019s numerous security agencies. Mobley himself, however, \u201chad no idea where he was,\u201d Islam said. Mobley\u2019s attorneys reported their last contact with their client was at Sana\u2019a\u2019s central prison on 27 February, when they were able to speak to him through a fence. Since then, they have been unable to meet with or access their client, whom Yemeni authorities have charged with murder, a capitol offense, stemming from Mobley\u2019s murky abduction off the streets of Sana\u2019a in 2010. It is rare for the United States to permit a foreign country to try one of its nationals, particularly one with a human rights record as dubious as Yemen\u2019s. But the role of the US in Mobley\u2019s case has been unclear from the start. Mobley, who was born in New Jersey and grew up in Philadelphia, had come to Sana\u2019a with his family in 2008 to study Arabic and Islam. Interviews the Washington Post conducted with some of Mobley\u2019s friends and associates from New Jersey indicate he grew increasingly religious and political in his 20s. Cori Crider, a lawyer with Reprieve, said Mobley \u201cspoke a couple of times\u201d in Yemen with Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen and preacher whom the Obama administration considered a senior figure within al-Qaida\u2019s local affiliate. Crider categorically denied her client\u2019s involvement in terrorism, saying Mobley wanted guidance from Awlaki, who had been a well-known preacher in the US, about remaining in Yemen after Islam had a difficult pregnancy. Over Christmas 2009, a man with ties to al-Qaida\u2019s Yemen branch attempted to detonate a plane heading from Amsterdam to Detroit. Fearing Yemen was about to become dangerous for them, the Mobley family went to the embassy to file paperwork for a return to the US.  But on 26 January 2010, eight armed and masked gunmen in two vans attempted to apprehend Mobley as he took a break from shopping in Sana\u2019a. They shot him twice in the leg when he attempted to run. That evening, according to a Reprieve court filing, 15 to 20 soldiers and policemen raided the Mobley family\u2019s home, at one point holding Islam and her children at gunpoint. When Islam went to the US embassy to report the incident the next morning, she saw \u201con the premises the Yemeni who had supervised the raid,\u201d bearing an official embassy badge. Within days of Mobley\u2019s apprehension, US interrogators, identifying themselves as \u201cMatt from FBI and Khan from DoD [the Department of Defense],\u201d according to the Reprieve filing, questioned Mobley during his convalescence about suspected ties to terrorism. They allegedly informed him \u201che had no constitutional rights\u201d and interviewed him about six times over three to four weeks.  But neither the US nor Yemen brought terrorism charges against Mobley. Yemen instead accused him of murdering a guard and shooting another during what they describe as an escape attempt, barely a month after Mobley\u2019s shooting. Reprieve believes the US was complicit in Mobley\u2019s original detention. \u201cI believe the US hoped to shake him down without the pesky obstacles of Miranda warnings, rules against mistreatment, and what have you,\u201d Crider said.  It is unclear if Mobley\u2019s prosecution can continue. Last week, Mobley missed his fifth pre-trial court date since February. The judge in the case has ordered Yemen\u2019s attorney general to produce Mobley, without success. During a hearing in August, a representative of Mobley\u2019s alleged victim asserted that Mobley is now in the custody of the Specialised Criminal Court, which human-rights groups consider to be abusive. Reprieve has said Mobley\u2019s disappearances began before counsel could introduce evidence into court indicating US complicity in his capture. Yemen has denied that Mobley is missing at all, and has claimed for months that Mobley has not been moved from his Sana\u2019a prison. Yet when the Guardian asked if Mobley has been moved to a military base, a spokesman for the Yemeni embassy in Washington DC, Mohammed Albasha, said only: \u201cHe is detained in Sana\u2019a and legal procedures will take its course.\u201d For months, the US State Department has deferred answering any questions about Mobley, claiming that to do so would violate his privacy. Yet US officials claim to have seen him and vouched for his health. In July, William Lesh, an official with the US embassy in Sana\u2019a, told Reprieve that a visit at a location Lesh would not reveal showed Mobley \u201cin good health with no major complaints.\u201d Lesh wrote in a letter dated 25 July that Mobley had requested a conversation with his Yemeni attorney but \u201cdid not wish us to contact anyone else.\u201d  Yemen is a critical counter-terrorism ally of the United States. It permits drone strikes by the CIA and the Joint Special Operations Command, while the US trains and underwrites Yemeni security institutions. Both the Central Security Forces and the National Security Bureau, which operates the Specialised Criminal Court, receive US funding, according to the International Crisis Group. Lisa Monaco, Barack Obama\u2019s senior counter-terrorism adviser, last visited Yemeni president Abed-Rabbo Mansour Hadi on 6 September, a month after speaking with him via telephone. During those conversations, Monaco underscored US support for Yemen, according to White House summaries. In announcing the expansion of his war against the Islamic State (Isis), Obama last week cited Yemen as a model for future US military actions in Iraq and Syria. The State Department would not respond to questions from the Guardian about Mobley\u2019s treatment and possible transfer. It instead issued a statement, which read: \u201cThe protection of US citizens abroad is one our highest priorities. Due to privacy considerations, we cannot comment further at this time.\u201d After the brief phone call with her husband, Islam said she attempted to enlist the help of the State Department, as she has repeatedly during her husband\u2019s seven-month incommunicado period. Yet Islam said US diplomats have given her rote and limited responses, without any evident action.  \u201cI imagined this phone call many a time in my head,\u201d said Islam, who attempted to tell Sharif that their eldest daughter has begun the second grade. \u201cBut I imagined that he would be [saying], \u2018Oh my God, I miss you, how are you, I love you\u2019 and all, but it was clearly the opposite. He was basically begging for help.\u201d", "sentences": ["Over Christmas 2009, a man with ties to al-Qaida\u2019s Yemen branch attempted to detonate a plane heading from Amsterdam to Detroit."], "title": "US man imprisoned in Yemen makes emotional plea: 'They're gonna kill me in here'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/15/us-man-yemen-contact-wife-sharif-mosley", "tags": ["Yemen", "US news", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-15T18:10:47Z", "article": "1. The top 1% no longer includes most doctors and head teachers To be in the top 1% of earners in Britain today, a couple with no children would need a minimum income of \u00a3160,000. A single person can enter the 1% with a little less, while a couple with children would need more. Hardly any GPs are paid enough to take their place in the top 1% any longer, despite the last decade\u2019s huge hike in their pay; their incomes have been far outstripped by those of the financiers above them. The best-paid head teachers, too, used to be within the top paid 1% in society. They have seen pay rises higher than most teachers, but, again, they have been overtaken in the rankings by financiers, managers, accountants and lawyers. The 1% can pay their children\u2019s university fees upfront. For the rest of us, it is debt. And, in recent years, the top doctors and teachers have become increasingly like the rest of us. There has always been a top 1%, but in the past it contained a wider range of people, including many who were respected more for the jobs they did. And the 1% is taking more and more. When I was a child, the 1% took a third of the share of national income they do today. Nowhere in Europe do they take as much as in the UK. 2. London is the home of the 1% Per head, there are more so-called ultra-high net-worth individuals (UHNWI) in London than anywhere else on the planet. These are defined as people with $30m (\u00a321m) or more in assets apart from their main home. The estate agents Knight Frank recently reported that 4,224 \u201cUltra\u201d families were living in London, with the number expected to reach 5,000 by 2024. The attraction is not just London\u2019s history, nightlife or its convenient time zone; it is Britain\u2019s lax tax regime. As Pippa Malmgren, one-time economic adviser to George Bush, put it: \u201cThe crackdown on tax havens in Switzerland has removed these old options for new capital. As a result, there has been a huge influx of global capital into the UK.\u201d London\u2019s wealthy elite also includes the largest concentration of Russian millionaires found outside of Moscow \u2013 at least 2,000, many of whom are also \u201cUltras\u201d. It is impossible to accurately assess their wealth because so much of it is hidden. But the donations from many of them to the Conservative party suggest that they have a direct interest in maintaining the low tax \u2013 especially wealth tax \u2013 policies of that party. It is not just property that the Russians are buying. 3. The super rich can view the lower classes as subhuman It is very hard to justify your huge wealth unless you see people beneath you as less deserving. Once the wealth gaps become very large, it is easier to get through the day if you see them as less able, less special. When earlier this month the civil society minister Brooks Newmark told people involved in charities that they should \u201cstick to their knitting\u201d rather than concern themselves with what might be causing the problems they were trying to remedy, he was exhibiting just such a \u201cdon\u2019t worry your pretty little head\u201d attitude. At the extreme, the less fortunate may not be seen as people at all. That was the finding of a study from Princeton University in which MRI scans were taken of several university students\u2019 active brains while they viewed images of different people. Researchers saw that photographs of homeless people and drug addicts failed to stimulate areas of the brain that usually activate whenever people think about other people, or themselves. Instead, the (mostly affluent) students reacted to the images as if they \u201chad stumbled on a pile of trash\u201d. The more economic inequality there is in a country, the more people are prone to instantly size up each others\u2019 status upon meeting. Some quickly cast their eyes down; others look over the shoulders of those they don\u2019t think they need to respect. Social psychologists from Berkeley and Amsterdam have studied strangers in situations where one told the other of a difficult personal experience, such as a death in the family. The larger the social gap, the less compassion was shown. Such behaviour, and the acceptance of it as normal, becomes much more prevalent in those places where the 1% have taken the most.     A homeless woman in London: research has shown that the larger the social gap, the less compassion is shown to those worse off. Photograph: Chris Helgren/Reuters    4. In the last 15 years, inequality has spiralled If the national minimum wage had kept pace with FTSE 100 CEO salaries since 1999, it would now be \u00a318.89 per hour instead of \u00a36.50. However, for some reason broadcasters rarely ask CEOs about the gulf between their pay and that of the poorest staff in their organisations. The unstated implication is that the lowest-paid staff are lucky to have any job at all, and only have what they have thanks to the benevolence of the 1%, with their superior leadership skills. If the top 1% actually created more jobs as they became wealthier, then ordinary people would be surrounded by employment opportunities in both the US and the UK. Instead, it is in Germany, where the wealthiest 1% receives in pay and bonuses half as much as their counterparts in the US, that unemployment is at a 20-year low. In countries that keep their top 1% in check, the highest earners work more effectively for the good of all, or at the very least create a little less misery. 5. Taxing more would cut down on greed To reduce wealth inequalities, you introduce wealth taxes, as we did with inheritance tax a century ago. However, if you want to keep inequality under control, you need a high top rate of income tax. The top rate in Switzerland and Germany has not fallen for the past half century; in both countries the top 1% earners now take a slightly smaller share of total income than they did in the 1960s. In the US and the UK, the 1% have gained the most as top taxes have fallen the most. Top taxes reduce income inequality not by raising revenue, but by deterring the greedy from asking for more money. When there is a tax rate of 60% or 70% on the slice of income above \u00a3200,000 or \u00a3250,000 a year, it makes little sense to pay employees much more than that. By not paying a few people very high salaries, firms can save enormous amounts of money. If Barclays bank didn\u2019t employ several hundred people on salaries of more than \u00a31m, but on more reasonable, if still high incomes, it could employ several thousand more staff to work in local branches threatened with closure. Similarly, the BBC could make better programmes using more producers if a few celebrities at the top were paid less. It has already begun this process. A more equitable pay distribution allows far more people for the same cost, and the reward is greater productivity. 6. Maintaining inequality requires penalising the poor The coalition government has already reduced the top rate of tax to 45%. Now it plans tougher benefit cuts for the poor. Under current financial plans, it will reward the top 1% even more in future, by cutting income taxes further. The rest of the top 20% can expect slight increases in their net income in the years up to 2016, while everyone else is impoverished. These figures are based on the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s own projections. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has produced statistics showing that George Osborne\u2019s plans will cut the proportion of GDP going to the state to the lowest level in western Europe by 2015, and for the first time below that in the US.

It is children who will suffer most from the spending cuts The tax, benefit and spending changes now underway will hit households with children hardest. These make up a third of households, according to the children\u2019s commissioner for England, but will suffer around two thirds of the cuts. On average, couples with no children will lose 4%, couples with children 9%, and lone parents 14% of their net income. Yet the 1% with children face no net cuts. Their loss of child benefit is more than outweighed by what they gain from tax cuts. The 1% in the UK can afford to put money into a highly pressured education for their children. This does not necessarily make them happy. Many may prefer a normal family life to a boarding school, paid handsomely to squeeze the highest possible exam grades from them. They are expected to gain entry to some of the \u201cbest\u201d universities and, in turn, to quickly secure a very highly paid job and do the same for their own children. They are not necessarily to be envied, but they come at a huge price, which others partly pay through austerity. One way of looking at the cost of the UK\u2019s 1% is that it is equivalent to running 1,100 royal families. 8. Many other parts of the world are becoming more, not less, equal In Switzerland and the Netherlands, the share of national income taken by the 1% has shrunk to historic lows. Inequalities have fallen since 1990 in Brazil and since 2000 in Sweden. Even in the UK, income inequalities since the 2008 crash have fallen back to early 1990s levels \u2013 if you strip out the very richest 1%. Only this tiny minority is still moving away from the rest. Since 2005, global economic inequalities have been falling, but again only if the wealth and income of the very richest is ignored. We are facing a fork in the road between having a majority global middle class, or most of us becoming a global service class employed to satisfy the needs of a tiny minority of super-rich individuals. In spring this year, Oxfam revealed that some 85 of the world\u2019s richest people now had as much wealth as the poorest half of all humanity. A few weeks later, Forbes magazine updated that estimate to just 67 people. Then, within days, they corrected that estimate on their website to 66 people, so fast was the wealth of the multi-billionaires rising in the world during early 2014. Such rapidly expanding bubbles always explode, and the larger they get, the more messily they end. 9. Concentration of wealth at the top is unsustainable \u2026 Wealth concentration damages economies. It focuses activity within finance and other services geared towards the super rich \u2013 resorts, hotels, all manner of servant duties \u2013 and away from actually productive work. It is far better to have a mixed economy where some manufacturing still takes place near to where goods are consumed. It is also damaging to rely on industries with high numbers of very low-paid employees. If you eat out half as much but pay twice as much for the privilege, then cooks, washers-up and waiters can be paid more, as they are in Switzerland. Nowhere in Europe \u201cemploys\u201d unpaid interns in such numbers as Britain, including in its financial industry; this does not make a vibrant market economy. Economists based in Hamburg, G\u00f6ttingen and Harvard recently studied trends since 1961 in nine high-income countries and revealed that, as those at the very top take more, overall economic growth becomes more sluggish. It is not just that the richest leave less in the pay chest for everyone else: the chest fills more slowly when the 1% take more, when employees must get by on subsistence wages, when interns must work themselves into the ground for nothing. 10. But no one knows when the tipping point will come It is exactly a century since the income and wealth of the 1% last began to fall abruptly. Inequality peaked in the years 1912 and 1913, when the organisation of British society was epitomised by the sleeping arrangements on the Titanic. That world was changed by external events: the first world war, the 1916 Easter uprising, the Russian revolution of 1917, and the influenza pandemic of 1918 that killed 50 million people worldwide. Taxes rose rapidly. The job was finished by unions, politicians and suffragettes, the greed of the 1920s bankers and the crash of 1929. The net income of the 1% was cut in half by 1939. Today there are not enough people to buy property in London at prices inflated by the greed of the 1%. Firms cannot sell enough to justify the largesse offered to a few at the top, and banks cannot legally or morally make enough profit to pay over 2,000 bankers more than \u00a31m a year. Roughly half the voters of Scotland haven\u2019t expressed their wish to leave the union in poll after poll because they see London and its inequalities as stable or sustainable. We can see the rising dissent and anger and the changing of attitudes towards the rich, but not the precise event that will come to be labelled as the turning point, just as we could not a century ago. But it is coming. We may even have passed it. Note how pay at the top of the BBC has fallen, and that no banker today is paid what Bob Diamond received a few years ago. The language and moral sentiment is changing. By being angry and disgusted with the current extent of inequality, we make it unacceptable, and its defenders become pariahs. Gross economic inequality is as vile as racism, misogyny and hatred of the disabled; as damaging in effect; and as dependent on a small group of supporters who believe that just a few should have more and more and more, because they\u2019re worth it. \u2022 Danny Dorling is the author of Inequality and the 1% (Verso Books, \u00a312.99), out this month.

There are expectations of how people are meant to respond when something appalling happens. There are rituals of grief, of outrage, of demands for justice. There\u2019s a pattern to it. Politicians have their role. So does the media. So do victims. Guard won\u2019t go along with it. He won\u2019t say that the deaths of his parents Jill and Roger when Malaysian airlines MH17 was shot out of the sky over Ukraine in July were any more significant than the deaths of almost 3,000 Ukrainians in the conflict. He won\u2019t say that the most crucial thing is to find the person responsible for firing a surface-to air-missile, which is believed to have blown up the commercial airliner, killing all 298 people on board. And he won\u2019t say that bringing home his parents\u2019 bodies is what matters most to him. \u201cI don\u2019t have an emotional connection with the bodies,\u201d he says in a hotel room in Melbourne, where he has travelled to witness his parents\u2019 coffins being unloaded from a military plane from the Netherlands. The Guards were among the first of 38 Australian citizens and residents identified and repatriated. Once the Melbourne coroner issues a death certificate and releases them, Paul and his brother David will accompany the bodies home to Brisbane for a private funeral.     Jill and Roger Guard at the airport before their European holiday.     \u201cAll the other families and most members of my own family are very keen to get the bodies back. And that\u2019s how politicians have responded \u2013 it\u2019s all about getting the bodies home. To me it means nothing. I\u2019d much rather see a peaceful solution in Ukraine. That\u2019s far higher priority for me, but I think I am unusual in that.\u201d Guard\u2019s father was a pathologist and \u201che was doing autopsies on bodies all the time\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t see them as having any significance in terms of who my parents were. If they hadn\u2019t found any bodies it wouldn\u2019t have been difficult for me emotionally. In some ways I\u2019d be happier if they\u2019d found nothing because I would then see it as a cremation in the sky.\u201d Guard, 36, is the eldest child of Jill and Roger, both doctors, and has taken on the responsibility of family spokesman and organiser. He has had a \u201ccrash course\u201d in dealing with the media, has received condolence calls from the prime minister, Tony Abbott, and foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and organised a public memorial for his parents in Toowoomba, the Queensland town where they lived for 30 years. He has set up a fundraiser in their honour to raise money for M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res.     Jill and Roger Guard in Brisbane in 2012.    Most families of the Australian victims have chosen to grieve in private. Guard believes the best way to honour his parents is to talk not just about them, but about the civil war that caused their death. When journalists were chasing the family to speak about his parents, Guard insisted on broadening the conversation beyond private grief. A Russian-backed separatist uprising began in eastern Ukraine in April, a month after Russia annexed Crimea. A ceasefire was declared on 5 September, but skirmishes have broken out on most days since. The tension between the west and Russia is as bad as it has been since the cold war. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to direct the conversation towards Ukraine and getting a resolution to that conflict,\u201d Guard says. \u201cMost of the media \u2026 are not that interested. All they want to know is \u2018how are you feeling\u2019? In my mind the conflict killed my parents. Every day the conflict goes on, the more innocent people are dying.\u201d Guard describes the past eight weeks as surreal. On 1 June he dropped his parents at the airport at the start of their six-week European holiday. Roger, 67, was head of pathology at Toowoomba hospital, west of Brisbane. Jill, 62, was a GP who volunteered for Meals on Wheels and helped Sudanese refugees settle into Toowoomba. While on holiday, her emails home were full of her longing to see her two grandchildren, Kai and Ella, the children of her daughter Amanda.     Jill Guard with her granddaughter Ella.    Paul was due to pick up his parents on the evening of 17 July. At 7am that morning, Amanda phoned him, distraught after seeing on television that a plane had been shot out of the sky in eastern Ukraine. Paul checked his parents\u2019 flight details and saw that they matched the downed plane, on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, where the Guards were to catch a connecting flight to Brisbane. Paul and his wife Jessie drove immediately to Amanda\u2019s house. David arrived and the family called as many people as they could to tell them the news before it was made public. \u201cWe basically just tried to console each other and camped there for a couple of days. The highest priority that day was to be together.\u201d Nothing seemed real. For a passenger plane to be blown out of the sky was bizarre. The television images seemed remote. There was no official confirmation until later that morning when the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) called to confirm that their parents were on the plane and to appoint a liaison officer for the family. The Dfat officer called every day for several weeks, keeping them updated and helping organise flights to attend the memorial service on 3 August.  An Australian federal police liaison officer was also appointed. That began the weeks-long process of formal identification and repatriation of the bodies. The three children gave DNA samples and were asked to recall every detail of their parents\u2019 bodies to try to help identify them. A watch found on Jill\u2019s body matched a watch in a photograph.  \u201cIt was hard for my sister Amanda. She was having a good day, and by the end of it she was completely wrecked.\u201d Guard is grateful that his parents have been identified \u2013 many families are still waiting. He and David flew to Amsterdam last week to take part in a sombre ceremony when their parents and seven other Australians were loaded onto military planes to be brought home.     The Guard family in Alaska in 2004: (from left) David, Amanda Jill, Roger and Paul.    Every person on MH17 had a story. There were children and parents and grandparents from the Netherlands, Malaysia, Indonesia, Britain, Germany, Belgium and New Zealand. Roger and Jill Guard\u2019s story was both ordinary and remarkable. They raised three children in a regional Queensland town. They valued education, and all their children have achieved academically \u2013 Paul is a coastal engineer, Amanda a physiotherapist and David is training to be a pathologist. Guard says his father was a \u201cscientist to the core\u201d. \u201cHe read books voraciously, but they were all non-fiction. He wouldn\u2019t touch a fiction book because he said there was enough to learn about the amazing world without having to make things up. \u201cThat\u2019s why he didn\u2019t believe in religion, either. What is there about the universe that has left you so unsatisfied you have to go and make up all this stuff about what\u2019s outside the universe?\u201d Roger collected butterflies, stamps and even golf balls. He was a bird-watcher. He would keep lists of trucks he saw when driving across Australia. Paul laughs. \u201cHe was a little eccentric.\u201d     Roger Guard, reading to his young children, Amanda and Paul.    Jill Guard\u2019s first priority was her family. \u201cShe was a great mother, she was very loving, always understanding, always there for us, always the shoulder to cry on. \u201cThey were both family people. They were also very strong community people and people who believed passionately in science and rational thought and celebrating nature.\u201d Guard hoped something good might emerge from the tragedy of MH17. There was a moment when it seemed so shocking, so unfathomable, so senseless, that it might bring the combatants to their senses. \u201cThe opposite happened. The Ukrainian government saw two things. They saw that the west was probably going to back them rather than the separatists.     Paul and Amanda Guard meet their new brother David in 1983.    \u201cThe second thing was that the crash \u2026 happened to be in a very strategic site.\u201d  Guard is grateful for Bishop\u2019s efforts to negotiate a United Nations security council resolution to secure and allow access to the crash site. It was a moment of hope, but it didn\u2019t last. The site was too dangerous for investigators and, two months on, remains insecure. Guard wishes the Australian government had taken a broader view and used its influence to push for a political solution to end the fighting as well as focusing on the Australians who perished. Guard now reads about the conflict every day. He knows that had his parents had the choice, they would have chosen to die rather than have lost any of their children or grandchildren. They would have been distraught at the children on the plane, especially the Maslin family from Perth, who lost three children, aged 12, 10 and eight. And he believes his parents would have wanted him to do something. \u201cI think it will change my life,\u201d he says of the day his parents died over eastern Ukraine. \u201cIt may not change what I do from day to day, although it may. Even if it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll always have in the back of my mind that my parents would want me to do something and that I want to do something my parents would be proud of, I suppose. I\u2019ve always wanted that, but even more so now that they\u2019ve gone.\u201d", "sentences": ["Paul checked his parents\u2019 flight details and saw that they matched the downed plane, on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, where the Guards were to catch a connecting flight to Brisbane.", "He and David flew to Amsterdam last week to take part in a sombre ceremony when their parents and seven other Australians were loaded onto military planes to be brought home."], "title": "MH17 victims\u2019 son grieves in his own way \u2013 by talking about Ukraine's suffering", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/17/-sp-mh17-victims-son-honour-parents-talking-about-ukraine", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Australia news", "Ukraine", "Australian politics", "Europe", "Plane crashes", "Russia", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-17T11:48:09Z", "article": " 12. Llandrindod Repair Cafe, Llandrindod Wells, Wales What is a repair cafe? It\u2019s exactly what it says on the tin; it\u2019s a place where you can go, with your broken items, to consult people more knowledgeable than you about how to fix them. Oh, and have a cup of tea and a cake while doing so. The world\u2019s first repair cafe appeared in Amsterdam in 2009, set up by Martine Postma. Now, there are around 400, from Australia to the US, with more being registered each day.  At present, Wales hosts two, one in Newtown and the other \u2013 which I am attending \u2013 in Llandrindod Wells, a Victorian spa town in the Radnorshire hills where folk would go to take the chalybeate waters, believed to be curative (and which taste like blood licked off a rusty hoe). Once a temperance town, it is poorly equipped with hostelries, but the hotels are grand (in one of which the Welsh FA meets annually to discuss how badly the qualifying campaign is going), the architecture impressive, and Rock Park, where Rupert Bear used to play (his creator, Mary Tourtel, lived in the town for some years), is a magical grade 2-listed squirrel-busy and salmon-rivered dingly dell where you can get contentedly lost and want never to be found again.  Llandrod\u2019s (as the locals abbreviate it) repair cafe takes place under the Rock Park pavilion canopy, all blue paint and frosted glass, mosaic floors and a horseshoe bar of marble. Late swallows zip through. Around it stand gingkos, sweet chestnuts, sequoias. Pierrot shows and balls were once held here. When I arrive, there are people up ladders, stringing wires, there are lathes, lamps, workbenches, and signs above them that read: Electricals &amp; computers/woodwork and general/textiles &amp; jewellery/bikes. Centrepiece is a small library table of instruction manuals and guides. A hanging banner reads: Throw it away? No way! Just visible, through a gap in the static thrash of exotic trees, is the playing field on which Roman soldiers would test their weapons. It\u2019s a strange and intriguing place, right enough.     Llandrindod Repair Cafe relies heavily on donations in this early stage of its development Photograph: Joseph Botting    I talk to Joe Botting and Nick Talbott, organisers (and Joe is also a geologist, whose fossil display in the town\u2019s museum is fascinating) and Hilary McAuley, who advises with woodwork and is also chairperson of the Friends of Rock Park. They clue me in on the repair cafe\u2019s ethos, how it is both galvanised and propelled by austere economics and a response to ecological concerns; white goods and the like, and their poisons, need to be recycled, cannibalised, maintained in working order for as long as possible. The terms throwaway culture, or disposable culture, belie the longevity of the discarded item\u2019s capacity to pollute and damage. Added to this is the desire to keep old skills alive, and pass them down, and to create new ones; the wireless speaker which I take along, for instance, would have been unthinkably ensorcelled to any frock-coated and top-hatted whiskered gent wincing at a beaker of sulphur water. And Di Greaves, as co-secretary for the Transition Group, sibling to the repair caf\u00e9, places the philosophy in the wider context; the Welsh towns of Rhayader, Presteigne, Montgomery and Newtown are preparing for a society post-carbon and fossil fuel. To quote the manifesto: \u201cWe are committed to positive local community action in response to the global challenges of economic crisis, climate change, and resource depletion \u2026 We see this transition as an enjoyable journey \u2026 We are non-political and non-confrontational.\u201d A world after peak oil, Greaves says, \u201cis on its way, and the politicians will do nothing.\u201d This is the apocalypse with a homely smile and a slice of Battenburg. It\u2019s Mad Max with a KitKat and a nice cup of tea. The well waters contain lithia.  The mayor, Elaine Worgan, sadly without her regalia, and Jan Swindale the town crier, resplendent in hers (and which, she proudly tells me, she made herself), turn up to open the proceedings; the bell is rung, the people \u2013 a score in number, at first, but many drift in and out throughout the day \u2013 are gathered, the announcement is made: \u2018Oyez! Oyez! Throw it away? No way!\u2019 Instantly there\u2019s industry, busy-ness; there is grinding and gossip, there are torrents of sparks. I take my speaker over to Jake Rothman, the electronics guy, and witness the birth of a new skill, namely that of discovering how to get into a sealed electronic box.     Llandrindod Repair Cafe staff are joined by the town cryer Photograph: Joseph Botting    It\u2019s a puzzle and a challenge which clearly delights Rothman. The original makers hide the screws, he explains, to deter DIY, which leads to increased profits for the manufacturers and greater expense for the consumer and, generally, needless waste. I\u2019m told about RoHS - the restriction of hazardous substances, which demanded that lead be replaced with tin, which is less toxic but a lot more perishable; there\u2019s been an expeditious increase in discards. A greater emphasis on repair, of course, is one solution to this. Rothman finds the hidden screws and gets into the box but he can\u2019t find anything wrong; I wonder about a built-in suicide device. \u201cThese are not designed to be fixed,\u201d says Rothman, but he\u2019s tenacious as a terrier, he identifies the problem and the solution (embarrassingly, after all that, it turns out that the plug has gone, so all it needed was batteries and a replacement lead. Ridiculous.  The problem is that if the piece of machinery is as baffling as a wireless speaker \u2013 I mean, how on earth do they work? \u2013 then I assume that the fault will be baffling too) and a few hours later I\u2019m home, Bluetoothing music across the house, the iPad and the wine at my knee, happy. As happy as the giant salmon seemed to be when it launched itself out of the Ithon when I went for a stroll through the Rock Park woods.  It\u2019s a tremendous idea, the repair cafe. And I loved, in Llandrod, the air of amiable assistance, the spirited warmth of communal endeavour; this sense is strengthened when Jake tells me that his grandfather was Benny Rothman, who led the great trespass across Kinder Scout. Credentials to admire. The well waters here were never going to mend the broken body, but a non-spinning washing machine, a tickless clock, an unchained necklace, a buckled bicycle, a silent speaker, or a wheezing planet \u2026 well, they\u2019re a different matter entirely.

Control freak. That\u2019s going to be reported in the Guardian: \u2018Jessie Ware, domestic prisoner\u2019.\u201d She\u2019s joking, but when we meet in her flat in south London to chat over caffeine-free tea, her usually easy-going demeanour is tinged with an undercurrent of mania. It\u2019s not surprising her nearest and dearest are trying to keep her away from any stimulants; a later misunderstanding about a caramel wafer leads to an outburst worthy of an East End gangster. But it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s on edge: as well as trying to organise her impending wedding in Greece (her mum calls during our interview with news on the venue: \u201cI bet that\u2019s my mum \u2026 It\u2019s my fucking mum! Sam, get it!\u201d), there\u2019s also the matter of her forthcoming second album, Tough Love, a mix of refined soul and crystalline pop. This juxtaposition between the artist (gregarious, deliciously foul-mouthed, prone to a good gossip) and the art (delicate, melancholic, sophisticated) is what makes Ware interesting. Cocooned in a loving relationship and on the cusp of marriage, she seems blissfully happy, yet Tough Love is littered with broken relationships. \u201cI\u2019m in a really happy stage of my life, but it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t write about things that affect me or that I relate to from the past,\u201d she says. \u201cSongwriting is about storytelling.\u201d Her new single, the weepy, gospel-tinged Say You Love, for example, was apparently not written with anyone in mind, but subconsciously dealt with the two years when she and Sam had split up. This lyrical focus on the bad times might have something to do with the fact that the mushy love songs she\u2019s written specifically for him tend to be the ones he dislikes. \u201cHe\u2019s never a fan of the ones I\u2019ve written about him,\u201d she laughs, legs tucked up beneath her chin. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018Babe, I\u2019ve written you this song.\u2019 Nothing. One new song, You &amp; I (Forever), is me celebrating the memory of the fact that he\u2019s proposed to me and that we\u2019ll be together for ever.\u201d She smiles, but then, and this is a very Jessie Ware thing to do, quickly adds: \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t come across as saccharine.\u201d It\u2019s telling that the creation of both Tough Love and her Mercury-nominated debut, Devotion, were marked by Ware\u2019s surprising lack of self-confidence. An early session for Devotion was curtailed after she burst into tears during an improvised singsong around the piano, while Tough Love featured a similar episode with a member of pop-songwriting royalty she asks me not to name. \u201cThe guy asked me to sit in the middle of the room while he played the piano and he told me to just sing and I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t do that,\u2019 and he said: \u2018No, just sing and I\u2019ll play.\u2019 I went in the other room and it reminded me of when I started writing the first album. I got a lump in my throat and was like: \u2018Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry.\u2019 I hate it. It felt like I was auditioning and soon as I\u2019m auditioning it gets scary.\u201d              This lack of confidence is surprising, I tell her, not least because her debut album peaked in the top five (\u201cIt was a slow week, I think,\u201d she counters) and Tough Love\u2019s featherlight title track and first single became her first UK top 40 single earlier this year. Again, her answer is self-deprecating: \u201cI mean, we say \u2018top 40\u2019 because 34 doesn\u2019t sound so good,\u201d she cackles, dunking a biscuit. \u201cBut no, it tells me my fans are really backing me. I felt very apologetic at the beginning. I felt like I had to earn this relationship and I\u2019m flabbergasted that that was the song that got me into the top 40, but I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d In a pop world full of cloying ambition and singers swinging around naked on demolition equipment to get people\u2019s attention, the sense that Ware herself can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s all really happening is heartwarming. Ask her if she\u2019s ambitious enough to try to conquer the US, like fellow heart-on-their-sleeve crooners Sam Smith and Adele, and she\u2019ll say, that while it would be nice, she\u2019s keen to get the people in the UK to like her first. \u201cAs long as I can carry on touring and having a career, then I\u2019m fine,\u201d she says. During a recent festival appearance in Finland, a last-minute change in lineup meant she was bumped up the bill. Again, the response isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d imagine from the likes of Jessie J. \u201cI said: \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be on the main stage because no one\u2019s going to be there,\u2019 and my sound guy was just like: \u2018Jessie, shut up, just fucking enjoy it,\u2019 and then I did enjoy it.\u201d While it\u2019s great to have big brash pop stars who are keen to kick down every proverbial door to get where they need to be, Ware feels like a throwback to the likes of Sade or Annie Lennox, creators of classic, universal pop songs about love and heartbreak, delivered with genuine warmth. Nearly 30, and with a debut album released when she was 27 \u2013 practically geriatric in pop terms \u2013 her route to stardom feels almost accidental. The daughter of a news reporter, she studied to become a journalist, briefly working as a sportswriter at the Daily Mirror and then at the Jewish Chronicle, before realising that her love of being nosy couldn\u2019t hide the fact that, as she puts it, she \u201cwasn\u2019t very good at writing\u201d. Asked by her old schoolfriend Jack Pe\u00f1ate to sing backing vocals for him on tour, she met the artist and producer SBTRKT, who asked her to sing on the appropriately titled Nervous. That, in turn, started a working relationship with Red Bull Studios, which offered her a more relaxed environment in which to work on Devotion. \u201cBasically, Red Bull Studios asked me to do Nervous at their Notting Hill carnival party and after that I recorded [debut single] Strangest Feeling at their studio. I still find the idea of writing and recording songs fucking petrifying. It got a bit easier the second time round, but at their studio it\u2019s not intimidating. It\u2019s the most warm and inviting environment.\u201d With half of Tough Love recorded at Red Bull Studios\u2019 London basement, and partly with their current in-house producer Julio Bashmore, Ware recently embarked on a remix project that involved visiting five of their studios across the world and getting five different producers \u2013 ranging from garage newcomer Preditah to Russian DJ Nina Kraviz \u2013 to remix the multilayered Keep On Lying. \u201cI just knew [Keep On Lying] would exist on the record as an album track but I wanted it to have a bit more of a spotlight on it,\u201d she explains. \u201cBashmore and I worked on it at their studios. He\u2019s the producer in residence there for a year and so I think it was a nice way of being able to thank them.\u201d Expressing gratitude towards an offshoot of a multinational drinks company, albeit a not-for-profit one, might come across as disingenuous. But after spending time with Ware both in the London studio and in Amsterdam for the Kraviz session, it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t do anything she\u2019s not comfortable with (she once turned down a remix from a diminutive pop superstar on the basis that it was rubbish), and that the people she works and surrounds herself with on a daily basis need to be friends first, collaborators second. So while that early recording session for Tough Love may have been intimidating, the finished album features an impressive roster of collaborators \u2013 including Dev Hynes, Ed Sheeran, Miguel and production duo BenZel, AKA Two Inch Punch and Benny Blanco \u2013 who have since become close friends. In fact, such was Ware\u2019s desire to make her two-day studio session with Miguel as relaxed as possible, she got so drunk celebrating the first day that she could barely muster the energy for the second. \u201cI had the worst hangover,\u201d she sighs, resting her head in her hands as if the memory alone has drained all the blood from her body. \u201cI thought I was dying. Vomiting everywhere. Go to the second session and Miguel\u2019s there and he\u2019s fresh and I\u2019m just pale with mascara all over my face. I was just a mess.\u201d The incongruity of having someone like Blanco \u2013 who has produced global pop hits for the likes of Rihanna, Maroon 5 and Kesha \u2013 working with a singer formerly prone to double-tracking her vocals in order to bury herself in the mix isn\u2019t lost on Ware. \u201cI joked with Benny and told him: \u2018This is going to be your least successful project ever. It has to be,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve developed a whole new group of friends that you would put in the music bracket, but they are very dear to me. Benny and Ben, who are BenZel, these are people I trust and who I call for advice. And yes, one of them happens to be a massive hitmaker, but I have to feel like there\u2019s a magic and trust with the people I work with.\u201d            It was through Blanco \u2013 whom she met in New York via mutual friends \u2013 that she got to work with Sheeran on the acoustic-led and romcom-ready epic Say You Love Me. It is, you feel, her first shot at a proper hit, a suggestion that causes her eyebrows to shoot up to meet her hairline. \u201cI think it\u2019s a classic, really well-written song,\u201d she mumbles sheepishly. \u201cIt shows another edge to my voice. Working with artists like Miguel and Ed pushed me vocally without them really knowing it. They\u2019re so talented and technically gifted so they\u2019d sing something and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Yeah, that sounds wicked,\u2019 and then I\u2019d try it and be like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have to practise that.\u2019 For this album, I\u2019ve definitely found a confidence with using my voice. I think I was scared and hiding my vocal on the first one and I didn\u2019t want too much of an identity \u2013 I wanted it to just be smooth.\u201d As with Devotion, Tough Love is an album the flits effortlessly between Radio 2-friendly ballads, such as the string-drenched Pieces, to the textured, Miguel-assisted Kind of \u2026 Sometimes \u2026 Maybe and the deliriously loved-up Champagne Kisses (which, she\u2019s keen to point out, isn\u2019t about \u201cexpensive blowies\u201d). It\u2019s a reflection of her ability to effortlessly straddle that previously untouched terrain between Best New Music write-ups on Pitchfork on the one hand and a guest appearances on The X Factor in Poland on the other (\u201cI\u2019m massive in Poland, I get like four bodyguards there,\u201d she laughs). \u201cI fucking loved doing The X Factor,\u201d she says unapologetically, when I suggest other artists might see it as bad for the brand. \u201cFor me, that was fucking brilliant. I think that\u2019s cool. I\u2019m very true to myself and I love pop music. So while I want it to sound relatively cool, I\u2019m not going to deny a massive hook.\u201d \u2022 The single Say You Love Me is out on 29 September, followed by the album Tough Love on 13 October, both on PMR/Island New soul traders \u2013 three more slinky UK acts Rosie LoweA textured tapestry of burbling electronics and scattershot drum beats, London-based Rosie Lowe\u2019s fragile 2013 EP Right Thing \u2013 co-produced by Ware collaborator Dave Okumu \u2013 announced an intriguing new talent unafraid to manipulate genre barriers. Producer Paul Epworth was so impressed he signed her to his label Wolf Tone and is working on her debut album, due in early 2015. More melancholic perhaps than Ware\u2019s brand of nu soul, Lowe\u2019s songs tend to draw on her varied musical background \u2013 she sang in jazz bands from the age of 13 \u2013 to create moments of unnerving beauty.            KwabsGhanaian-born, London-based Kwabena Sarkodee Adjepong, AKA Kwabs, has also worked with Dave Okumu on the undulating soul of Spirit Fade, a track taken from his debut EP, Wrong or Right. It\u2019s the title track \u2013 produced by the enigmatic Sohn, who\u2019s also worked with nu-soul practitioners Banks and Rhye \u2013 that fully showcases Kwabs\u2019 ability to melt his big soulful voice into the fidgety, electronic textures summoned by his producers. While that early EP overflowed with hooky melodies, its slightly inward-looking standpoint has been exploded on new single Walk, a string-drenched stomper aimed directly at radio playlists.            Billie BlackWith influences including a host of jazz greats (she studied at the Guildhall School of Music) to sadface electronic singer James Blake and downcast R&amp;B crooner Sampha, 19-year-old Billie Black makes the kind of breathy, modern soul that sounds simultaneously welcoming and strangely unnerving. I Don\u2019t Need Another Lover, for example, pulls off that Jessie Ware-esque trick of encasing a fairly straightforward love song in a constantly shifting, electronic-tinged setting, while I\u2019ve Waited For You sounds like finger tips tapping skin. A recent collaboration with 18-year-old producer Mura Masa on This Simple Pleasure also showcases how versatile her voice is \u2013 its featherlight tones gliding over more vibrant production.

It is transforming the spaces we live in and the way we live in them. For those who are unaware of Airbnb, it is a website whereby you rent out spare rooms in your house or flat \u2013 or the whole property. My family have been using it for close on a year and it has been immensely positive. The benefit has not been merely economic \u2013 although it really does help ends meet \u2013 but social too. Our children have met people from all over the world and become accustomed to sharing what they once thought of as their personal space with people they have never met. I was doubtful about Airbnb. Waking up in the morning, stumbling to the bathroom and being faced on the landing with someone you have never seen before is disconcerting (even if the stranger\u2019s face is one of a fashion model \u2013 the nature of that business means that such temporary accommodation is in high demand). But it\u2019s not as discomfiting as I imagined and it doesn\u2019t happen that often. What I am struck by in meeting this\u00a0procession of visitors is how friendly, quiet and respectable they are. Almost without exception the people who have come into our house have been a pleasure to welcome. This is some sort of antidote to the counter-tendency of society, that of isolation through computers and mobile phones. There are occasionally awkward moments. Sometimes our children have to share a room because we have the lodgers in \u2013 but they don\u2019t seem to mind. It turns out that family space is far more flexible than we had imagined. Sometimes a visitor may happen to share the kitchen while we are having our meal, and there are stilted conversations in broken English. No big deal. The credits very much outweigh the debits. I find it interesting and encouraging that just as we are experiencing a property shortage in London, a system has cleverly, almost organically, arisen to fill empty space in houses. I feel there must be a way that the system can work to help people in this country who are in need of living space, rather than visitors from abroad \u2013 perhaps supported by local authorities. This could only be a short-term solution, obviously, but perhaps \u2013 for example \u2013 a woman who is suffering domestic abuse could find refuge in the right home cheaply and place herself at the heart of a family rather than some anonymous local authority institution or refuge. Quite apart from the social implications, Airbnb opens the world\u00a0to families who could otherwise not afford it. I am taking my four\u00a0daughters to Amsterdam later in the year because I found an Airbnb house that I could afford, whereas the price of a hotel would have made the trip prohibitive. The very success of Airbnb threatens vested interests such as the hospitality business \u2013 hotels must be feeling the heat and some in the industry are lobbying for Airbnb to be controlled or even banned, mainly on health and safety grounds. I feel their pain every time I reach for one of their \u00a34 fizzy drinks from the mini-bar, but I feel that they will just have to up their game to compete. Airbnb is almost too good to be true and I fear it is only a matter of time before scare stories appear about strangers, say, renting a house and stripping it bare. Then there will be a flurry of calls to legislate or limit the practice. But this is an innovation that should be encouraged \u2013 it is economical, builds bridges between people and cultures and teaches families to share \u2013 and that far outweighs any imagined or real risks. \u2022 Follow Tim on Twitter @timlottwriter", "sentences": ["I am taking my four\u00a0daughters to Amsterdam later in the year because I found an Airbnb house that I could afford, whereas the price of a hotel would have made the trip prohibitive."], "title": "Airbnb: the social benefits of renting out a room", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/19/airbnb-social-benefits-renting-out-room", "tags": ["Airbnb", "Parents and parenting", "Family", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-19T16:45:06Z", "article": "This year\u2019s Unseen photo fair in Amsterdam is unusally surreal. In the entrance hall, an escalator takes punters one by one up to a giant inflated cloud, which explodes with light when you leap on it. A picture of every jumping person is instantly loaded on to an ever-growing photographic cloud for the project, Trust the Cloud. In the main square, a large sculpture is taking shape over the weekend: giant brightly coloured lightbulbs and spools hanging from gnarled branches covered in a fishing net. It is called A Durian Growing a Swinging Sponge on a Fractal Evening and is unmistakably the work of set painter-cum-artist Lorenzo Vitturi. There he is, perched on a crane, drill in hand, adding another bulb. An outgrowth of his Dalston Anatomy project (which saw him take strange, saturated shots of vegetables to show life on east London\u2019s Ridley Road Market), the sculpture is the symbol of this year\u2019s Unseen, which undercuts the commerciality of most art-photography fairs with moments of high mischief.     An installation by Lorenzo Vitturi at Unseen 2014. Photograph: Tsuyoshi Yamada    As night fell on Thursday, smoke filled the air outside the former gasworks. It was wafting from a barbecue bucket tended by London-based artist Melinda Gibson, who was inviting passersby to partake in a performance called The Smoke House. In four small smoke houses, copies of her new book (the latest Self Publish, Be Happy book-club offering) were absorbing wood and coal smoke. Once hot, they were sealed and sold to the public. It was, so the programme says, \u201ca ritual act of defiance\u201d linked to an actual fire that damaged Gibson\u2019s studio recently \u2013 but it became a large gathering of revellers drawn to the campfire atmosphere. I went to dinner reeking of smoked photobook. Earlier on, I had been introduced to Augustin Rebetez with the words, \u201cYou should check out this guy\u2019s work. It\u2019s pretty wild.\u201d I did. It is. Rebetez makes photographs, drawings and films obsessively. At the Galerie Nicola von Sanger, his work covers two walls: primitive paintings, collages and photos of strange things that show a singularly dark imagination. Children look like zombies. A bald woman with kohl-rimmed eyes could be their undead mother. The legs of what look like a row of homemade electric chairs sprout shoes.     Another piece by Rebetez. Photograph: \u00a9 Augustin Rebetez/Galerie Nicola von Senger and Festival Images    On a third wall, a bizarre single-frame animated film plays on loop: a dead crow flies from a wooden case and flutters around a house, in which bodies emerge from drawers, slither across bare floorboards and up a flight of stairs then disappear. Makeshift machine-men whirr frantically as though they are trying to take flight. It is as if Rebetez\u2019s photographs and drawings have come to life in homage to the Quay Brothers. (Watch some of his videos here.) Over at the book market, RVB books are selling Rebetez\u2019s new book Anthill Memories, which captures his relentlessly active imagination. Like the films, many of the the photographs were constructed around his house in the Swiss Jura mountains with the help of his friends \u2013 many of whom seem to be circus performers. Strangeness abounds: there\u2019s a collapsing caravan, a crumpled house in a field of snow and the outline of Nosferatu on a battered fence. It is hard to know what is real and what created, but the sense of playful pranks is present in all his work. His website he tells us, \u201cMy father also publishes my books. My cousin has a brewery.

Having witnessed in Scotland what can only be described as a democratic revolution, Plaid Cymru wants to see a similar debate in Wales, with mass participation among all sectors of society. Scottish people have shaken the establishment and we&apos;ve seen Westminster&apos;s panicked response. Now all political parties agree that the status quo is not an option and that we cannot go back to business as usual. Many promises have been made, and on Friday the prime minister reaffirmed his commitment to rebalancing power in the UK. Action must now follow words. In this period of transition, Plaid Cymru will speak up for Wales and ensure that we are not sidelined. It would be unthinkable for MPs to pass a comprehensive package of powers to Scotland while simultaneously limiting Wales to yet another insufficient settlement. It is time for Wales to end its spectator status and make sure that our demands are articulated clearly so that we get the powers we need instead of the piecemeal devolution we&apos;ve been subjected to. Ken Livingstone, former mayor of London      Just after my election I met Yury Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, to discuss our cooperation. When I explained to him how the British government works, he exclaimed: &quot;That is worse than Russia under Stalin.&quot; He wasn&apos;t joking. Of all the western democracies none is as centralised and undemocratic as the UK. In America and Germany, a majority of state spending is administered by regional and local government. Here 95% of all tax is collected by the chancellor and every infrastructure project has to be agreed by Whitehall. In my time as mayor every single transport project I proposed was fought by civil servants. It was only at a private dinner with Ed Balls that Crossrail was agreed, but he warned me: &quot;It might take me a year to get it through the machine.&quot; More than 40 years ago, a royal commission recommended regional government for England, Scotland and Wales. Under such a system local people could oversee their hospitals, colleges and police, but even more importantly draw up the long-term plans for investment in infrastructure that could lay the foundations for Britain becoming a high-tech, high-skill economy. Britain has lagged behind most other western nations in terms of our infrastructure with all the consequences of declining productivity \u2013 this must not continue. George Ferguson, mayor of Bristol      If ever there was a moment for real devolution to our cities and communities, it is now.

This initiative is based on the notion that real devolution and informed policymaking best lies with engaged city leaders, rather than detached national governments. As Britain&apos;s main drivers of growth, our cities are hampered by having too few financial and legal freedoms and receive far too little of the benefit of their actions, even though the eight core cities of the UK generate 27% of the national economy, and London 25%. Yet all too often we have to dance to Whitehall&apos;s tune, as we are forced to beg the government for a slice of the transport, education, health or social-services pies. There is growing evidence that greater autonomy for cities results in greater contributions to the national economy. There have been baby steps in this direction in the form of city deals, but real devolution is exemplified by some of our continental counterparts who generally retain a much higher proportion of their tax base and are far more in control of their own destinies. If we are to achieve good growth to create full employment, to spend our citizens&apos; taxes more efficiently, and to repair the broken elements of society, we must move away from such centralised control. We are ready and waiting. Richard Leese, leader of Manchester city council     Richard Leese Photograph: Richard Leese    For many years there has been a logical case for greater devolution in England, and indeed across the UK as a whole. It is a case that leaders of major cities have consistently pressed. What the Scottish referendum has changed is that there is now an unavoidable political imperative for greater devolution elsewhere as well. The greater freedoms and flexibilities that will be enjoyed by Scotland, and indeed Wales, have shone a spotlight on the comparative shackles worn by English cities and regions. This disparity is untenable. Greater Manchester has a larger economy than Wales, and almost the same-sized population, yet we have considerably less freedom over our funding and spending priorities. Excessive centralisation, where we are dependent on Westminster for funding which usually comes with one-size-fits-all conditions attached, is hampering our performance. Greater Manchester has a decades-long record of working together across local authority and even political boundaries. In recent years the Greater Manchester combined authority, the nation&apos;s first such institution, has built on this platform. We believe we are ideally placed to be one of the trailblazers for city devolution and that the combined authority \u2013 which corresponds with our area&apos;s functional economic geography \u2013 is the logical level at which to do this. Jeremy Clifford, editor of the Yorkshire Post     Jeremy Clifford    On a visit to Leeds last Thursday, Nick Clegg said the &quot;devolution genie is out of the bottle now&quot;. In light of the Scottish referendum, there is no going back on the issue of delivering increased powers, not only north of the border but also to the English regions. Indeed, in Yorkshire \u2013 where for some time there has been a growing chorus calling for a greater say over major policy issues confronting the county \u2013 there is a sense of anger that Scotland will be rewarded for its actions. But Yorkshire is not looking for greater powers on its own. The northern region is a potential powerhouse of economic regeneration, but is held back by lack of investment from Whitehall. Its political leaders already work together to identify how to coordinate themselves, to call for greater autonomy and power. And with that must come greater control over the purse strings. There is a huge appetite for more devolved powers in Yorkshire, but there is also concern about just what that means. What is not in doubt though, is that Yorkshire will not stand by and see Scotland have increased power without it also having more influence over its own decision-making.", "sentences": ["This weekend I moderated the first session for a global parliament of mayors in Amsterdam."], "title": "Is the devolution genie truly out of the bottle? | Comment panel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/22/devolution-genie-out-of-bottle-scottish-independence-referendum", "tags": ["Devolution", "Politics", "UK news", "Manchester", "Greater Manchester", "Wales", "Bristol", "Yorkshire", "Plaid Cymru"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-23T05:41:27Z", "article": "The Riders is probably the only opera to feature an American Express office. But then Tim Winton\u2019s novel, on which it is based, is a nightmarish travelogue as much as a story of unexplained loss. So the credit facilities and travel hubs (Shannon airport, Paris\u2019s Gare de Lyon) make sense. Winton\u2019s story racks up a lot of frequent flyer points: loveable knockabout Scully, an innocent Australian abroad, wants to fulfil his wife Jennifer\u2019s desire to live in rural Ireland. He does up an old bothy while she goes back to Western Australia for a couple of months with their young daughter Billie to settle affairs. On the day of their return, however, only the child comes through the airport\u2019s sliding doors, traumatised and unable \u2013 or unwilling \u2013 to explain what has happened to her mother en route. The novel (written in pre-mobile phone era 1994) depends on arrangements by telegram and short, increasingly distrustful calls to former friends who all seem to be withholding information. Scully and Billie embark on a helter-skelter and increasingly penniless journey (care of Amex), to Hydra, Paris, Florence and Amsterdam, retracing the family\u2019s recent journey and confronting a host of characters who may or may not hold the key to Jennifer\u2019s vanishing. How do you condense a 380-odd page novel into 90 minutes of sung storytelling? By picking out key images and phrases, says librettist Alison Croggon, and by remembering this is now a work of theatre. The rhythm of words is crucial and although her libretto was created before the score \u2013 \u201cI wrote the first draft very quickly to get my initial reactions on paper\u201d \u2013 she stresses it was a collaboration. \u201cI don\u2019t just give him the libretto and send him off,\u201d she says of composer Iain Grandage, who commissioned Croggon in 2012. The poet, novelist and theatre critic enjoys the strictures, the way Grandage asked her for very specific changes, the sudden demand for \u201canother 10-syllable line that rhymes with beach\u201d. This is Croggon\u2019s eighth libretto but her first adaptation of a full-length novel. Though daunting, it\u2019s \u201clogical\u201d to write libretti if you write poetry, she says. Save for giving the project his initial blessing, Winton was not involved. The award-winning writer\u2019s work has been adapted for TV, film and stage more often then any other living Australian novelist but he\u2019s famously hands-off. \u201cI stopped thinking about it years ago,\u201d Winton says of The Riders. \u201c[Iain] came to me \u2013 what am I going to say except \u2018why?\u2019\u201d. He wouldn\u2019t have a clue how to adapt his own work for opera, he says, confessing that he finds the power of music frightening. \u201cOne of the miracles of music is its economy of emotion, but it\u2019s dangerous; it\u2019s freighted.\u201d              Grandage gained Winton\u2019s permission after writing the music for the stage version of Cloudstreet, the author\u2019s best-known work. He also scored Winton\u2019s first play, Rising Water and a section of the film, The Turning. Winton for his part says he admires Grandage for his musicianship, his \u201cbrinkmanship\u201d and his eclectic taste. The author\u2019s lack of preciousness is fortunate; both Grandage and Croggon prefer to call the opera a reimagining rather than an adaptation and it\u2019s fair to say that some major liberties have been taken with the novel\u2019s plot, changes necessary for dramatic reasons, they both insist. A major shift is the presence of Jennifer as a character rather than a cipher. It was an early decision \u2013 the haunting qualities of the book and the dangling question of her disappearance didn\u2019t work on stage. \u201cIn the end, all our responses to Jennifer were that she needed to have more obvious motives; we wanted to answer some of these, ones that are left unanswered by the book,\u201d says Grandage.  Croggon agrees: \u201cWe\u2019re true to the emotional arc of the novel. It did bother me that Jennifer was merely an absence [in the novel] seen only through Scully\u2019s eyes.\u201d It\u2019s very much a \u201cbloke\u2019s book\u201d, she adds. Indeed, the book\u2019s negative portrayal of most of the adult women has given rise to accusations of misogyny (a charge Winton trenchantly dismisses). The abandoning of the child seems particularly callous, but, as Croggon says, where would half of literature be without cruel mothers?      Isabela Calderon as Billie and Barry Ryan as Scully. Photograph: Jeff Busby/Victorian Opera    A visit to rehearsals coincides with a run through of a climactic scene in Paris\u2019s Notre Dame cathedral, building on a less dramatic scene in the book. The revolving stage is dominated by a series of wooden hurdles. These are transformed into a wide range of settings and even characters, including the enigmatic riders of the title, who may or may not be Celtic ghosts from Ireland\u2019s turbulent past. A co-production between Victorian Opera and Malthouse theatre, the artistic directors of both companies are running this show, Marion Potts as director (replacing Neil Armfield who who was originally attached) and Richard Mills as conductor.  Orchestra Victoria\u2019s soundscape is supplemented by bouzoukis, piano accordions and virtuoso soloist Genevieve Lacey on recorder. Baritone Barry Ryan, soprano Jessica Aszodi and mezzo-soprano Dimity Shepherd are principles in a very experienced cast, but finding the right juvenile for the daughter was harder. After Billie\u2019s age was increased to 10, 17-year-old Isabela Calderon, a student at Wesley College and a member of VOs youth chorus was cast in the role. Billie, says Potts, is \u201cthe emotional through-line\u201d as Scully becomes increasingly infantilised. This is Potts\u2019s first opera but she\u2019s enjoying the experience especially, she says, the \u201chigh state of human emotion and opera\u2019s capacity to span the intimate and the epic\u201d. It\u2019s Grandage\u2019s first opera, too, although the classically-trained cellist has previously composed a range of material instrumental and vocal material alongside his work as a musical director and theatre collaborator.  As well as echoes of Schubert\u2019s Erlk\u00f6nig and Death and the Maiden, his score riffs on Irish and Greek folk music with snatches of Weimar cabaret. A recurring motif is a musical setting of Irishman Patrick Kavanagh\u2019s lovelorn poem, Raglan Road, which Winton used to mark each section of the book.     Jerzy Kozlowski, Dimity Shepherd and David Rogers-Smith as the Riders. Photograph: Jeff Busby/Victorian Opera    The Riders differs from most of Winton\u2019s output in that it isn\u2019t set in his beloved WA. Even so, says Grandage: \u201cit\u2019s imbued with Australia. Its egalitarian ideals are in its bones.\u201d He\u2019s in awe of Winton\u2019s ruthless portrayal of male fragility, \u201chis ability to embody the everyman and capture the stunted emotional growth of the Australian male psyche.\u201d And despite the drama of ceaseless travel, The Riders ultimately offers a very different form of transportation: \u201cmy opera speaks to the emotional trajectory of the novel, rather than its geography.\u201d \u2022 The Riders runs from 23 September to 4 October at Malthouse theatre, Melbourne", "sentences": ["Scully and Billie embark on a helter-skelter and increasingly penniless journey (care of Amex), to Hydra, Paris, Florence and Amsterdam, retracing the family\u2019s recent journey and confronting a host of characters who may or may not hold the key to Jennifer\u2019s vanishing."], "title": "The Riders: Tim Winton's novel is now an opera with a few surprises", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/23/the-riders-tim-wintons-novel-is-now-an-opera-with-a-few-surprises", "tags": ["Opera", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Australia news", "Fiction", "Books"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-23T12:35:38Z", "article": "London has overtaken Hong Kong as the world\u2019s most expensive city to live and work in, with a new study suggesting it is almost twice as pricey as Sydney, and four times more than Rio de Janeiro. The estate agent Savills said that in London, rising rents and the strong pound had pushed up the typical cost per individual employee of renting somewhere to live and leasing office space to $120,000 (\u00a373,800) a year. That puts the UK capital well ahead of other global hubs such as New York and Paris which, aside from Hong Kong, are the only other locations where the combined annual costs of renting residential and office space top $100,000 per employee. London\u2019s rise to first place in the rankings was blamed in part on its soaring property prices, which have jumped by 18.4% in the past year, according to Savills. Office rents have also risen significantly. In its most recent quarterly report on the commercial property sector, the rival estate agent Knight Frank said that over the previous 12 months, prime office rents had risen by 9% in the City and by 8% in the West End area. Someone with \u20ac100m to spend would be able to buy just 2,700 square metres of prime office space in the West End, but would get 17,000 square metres or more for their money in Berlin or Amsterdam. The pound\u2019s strength against the dollar has made the situation worse. According to the Savills study, London\u2019s overall real estate costs grew in US dollar terms by an annualised rate of 10.6% in the first six months of the year, making the it \u201cthe world\u2019s most expensive city for companies to locate employees\u201d. That in turn prompted Savills to warn that it risks becoming less competitive as a result. \u201cFor example, the availability of low-cost office space in and around Silicon roundabout, coupled with affordable residential accommodation, helped put the capital on the technology map. But gentrification has priced out new startups, and the vitality of central London locations are at risk as they become too expensive for the types of occupiers that made them attractive in the first place,\u201d the report said. By contrast, falling residential rents and a weakening currency contributed to Hong Kong, which had previously topped the table for five years running, dropping to second place. Savills\u2019 12 Cities report is designed to help companies assess the costs of relocating employees. It measures the total cost per employee in US dollars of renting living and working space in some of the world\u2019s global hubs. The calculations are based on the cost of two seven-strong staff teams that are representative of start-up businesses, one based in a \u201cprime financial sector location\u201d and the other in a slightly less prime or creative area, in order to give a representative figure. The annual per person cost of renting somewhere to live is also factored in, on the basis that employers are interested in these costs because upward pressure on wages may be stronger in areas where the cost of accommodation is high. The annual cost per employee in London was put at $120,568, with Hong Kong close behind at $115,717. New York and Paris were in third and fourth place, at $107,782 and $105,550 respectively. Sydney came eighth at $63,630, Shanghai tenth at $43,171 and Rio eleventh at $32,179. Mumbai was bottom of the table at $29,742. \u201cDespite its climb in the rankings from fifth to first place since 2008, London is still a way off the live/work accommodation costs record, set by Hong Kong in 2011 at $128,000 a year,\u201d Savills said, adding that Hong Kong was still \u201cby far the most expensive city\u201d in which to buy residential property, with prices 40% higher than London \u2013 although the gap was narrowing. \u201cComparatively affordable\u201d Rio and Sydney had seen significant increases in live/work costs since 2008 \u2013 up 85% and 58% respectively \u2013 but Savills said Rio still looked \u201chighly competitive\u201d. Yolande Barnes, the company\u2019s director of world research, said: \u201cThis year has seen much more modest real estate price growth in nearly all our world cities, and some have shown small falls. We expect this subdued trend to continue as investor interest and market activity shifts to second-tier cities. \u201cThis lower level of price growth means that currency fluctuations have produced some of the biggest changes in our rankings, which are expressed in dollar terms. For multinationals looking at their local costs, it is this which is likely to exercise them more than property markets over the next year.\u201d Beauty at a price Hong Kong is a beautiful city, a sub-tropical forest of gleaming skyscrapers set against a backdrop of turquoise water and verdant hills. Its beauty, however, comes at a price. Asia\u2019s financial capital is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest cities and one of its most densely-populated. Its 7 million residents share 1,104 sq km of space - London\u2019s 8.3 million share almost half as much space again - and the combination has created a nightmare scenario for the city\u2019s frugal flat-hunters. Even modest Hong Kong homes can sell for millions of pounds, and an average family can easily spend 50% of its income on accommodation. One developer recently listed the world\u2019s most expensive home by square foot: a \u00a364m, four-bedroom mountaintop abode featuring a private pool and rooftop terrace. Wealthy locals and mainland Chinese trade Hong Kong apartments as readily as many westerners do shares, and a speculative buying spree has caused prices to double since 2009. Rising living costs have been cataclysmic for the city\u2019s working class. About 170,000 people don\u2019t have apartments of their own, and some live in cage-like cubicles in mercilessly subdivided flats. Some of the city\u2019s pleasures, however, still come cheap. A ferry ride across Victoria harbour offers sweeping skyline views for no more than 60p, and a short metro ride costs less than \u00a31. An unpretentious street lunch - a bowl of wonton soup, some Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce - costs about \u00a34, inexpensive by western standards, but twice as much as a similar meal in Shenzhen, just across the border in China.

Speaking on the fringes of Climate Week in New York, Eduardo Paes said: \u201cThey should have more autonomy, it would make a difference.\u201d Most cities are subject to regulations and policy set at the national level, which can fail to take account of their individual needs and characteristics, he said. \u201cNational governments make decisions but do not consider what cities are doing [on energy and climate] and therefore do not properly support cities,\u201d he argued. That can also result in a lack of financing for cities to be able to make vital changes, such as improving energy efficiency and public transport, he said. In many countries, mayors of large cities have extensive powers, including over policing, transport, building and large aspects of health and education. But energy policy is usually dictated by national governments, with cities having little say in how their residents and businesses are powered. Paes, who hosted the 2012 environmental conference Rio+20 and is chair of the C40 group of cities which have pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change, added: \u201cCities need to work with national governments and regional governments on this. Cities have the capability to cut global emissions by 3 gigatonnes, our research has found - this is a big opportunity.\u201d As part of Climate Week, which kicked off on Sunday with a 300,000-strong march through New York and similar marches around the world, the C40 group presented its annual prizes to cities that have come up with innovative ways to improve the environment. Among the ten awards were two for London, on air quality and carbon accounting. The former was criticised by green campaigners as the UK\u2019s capital has a record of breaching EU air quality standards. Other winners included China\u2019s Shenzen, for urban transportation, and Seoul for green energy, Amsterdam for finance and economic development, and Barcelona for intelligent city infrastructure. Paes said the examples of cities performing well should inspire others. \u201cI am confident that their knowledge and experience will help drive other cities to implement on-the-ground solutions faster and more efficiently. Through cooperation and collaboration, cities continue to deliver the results that are having a global impact.\u201d More than half of the world\u2019s population live in cities, and they produce the majority of greenhouse gas emissions.  City residents are also among those likely to face the perils of climate change, including rising sea levels - many major cities, from London and New York to Shanghai, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro are built by the sea - and the threat of major rainfall and extreme weather. Often, city infrastructure - including power networks, sewage and drainage systems, telecommunications and transport - has been built to old specifications that may not reflect the stresses they could be put under if global warming proceeds rapidly. The vulnerability of even modern, rich and industrialised cities to extreme weather was illustrated when Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, overwhelming much of the infrastructure in the areas worst affected. \u2022 Fiona Harvey\u2019s travel to New York was paid for by Siemens, one of the sponsors of the C40 awards.", "sentences": ["Other winners included China\u2019s Shenzen, for urban transportation, and Seoul for green energy, Amsterdam for finance and economic development, and Barcelona for intelligent city infrastructure."], "title": "Rio de Janeiro mayor: give cities power over energy to help climate fight", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/24/rio-de-janeiro-mayor-give-cities-power-over-energy-to-help-climate-fight", "tags": ["Climate change", "Cities", "Environment", "Energy", "Energy efficiency", "Brazil"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-25T11:55:38Z", "article": "Property group Hammerson has slipped back after unveiling a surprise fundraising of around \u00a3400m.

It is named Liberation Boulevard in reference to the nation\u2019s struggle for freedom in 1945. Starting near Partizan\u2019s stadium, it goes right along Red Star\u2019s Marakana before fading into a thick forest. There, hidden by foliage, an oak-panelled door stands at the entrance of the Banjica concentration camp from where thousands of Jews, Serbs and Roma were deported from July 1941 to October 1944. The first week of October will commemorate the 70th anniversary of the camp\u2019s liberation. The families of those imprisoned at Banjica will have reacted with horror to the antisemitic banner displayed by Partizan ultras in the Europa League game against Tottenham last Thursday. The club named after Tito\u2019s anti-Nazi resistance movement now waits for a possible sanction from Uefa on 3 October. The incident (the banner, based on the Only Fools and Horses logo, said \u201cOnly Jews and Pussies\u201d) was reported by both clubs and the referee, Alon Yefet, from Israel. It prompted renewed outrage in England following the controversy surrounding the Under-21 game in 2012 when Danny Rose was racially abused. Partizan offered an apology and the club\u2019s general secretary, Darko Grubor, pledged it would do everything to \u201cidentify and prosecute the idiots\u201d. The real concern, however, is what will happen if the supporters are identified. This is not the first time Partizan\u2019s Grobari ultras have grabbed headlines for the wrong reasons. Last season one of their members descended pitch-side after a Champions League exit to Ludogorets and snatched captain Marko Scepovic\u2019s armband. The following day they staged a surreal press conference explaining how both were actually good friends. It was mostly the ultra doing the talking. This came after another ultra had slapped Lazar Markovic, now with Liverpool, in the face after a draw against Sloboda. There was no press conference that time to shed light on whether Markovic turned the other cheek. A culture of silence prevails over what plagues Serbian club football and the perception of Serbia abroad. Every year Partizan\u2019s top players leave the country but the ultras remain. The support from the Grobari and the Delije (their Red Star counterparts) is fanatical. Red Star closed in on the league title last season with obsessive support even at training sessions. However some unrestrained individuals sometimes invite themselves to the party and turn it into a disgrace. In 2007-08 Partizan were expelled from the Uefa Cup despite an 11-1 aggregate victory against Zrinjski Mostar, after their away fans fought with the local police. Domestic institutions charged with dealing with the matter have proved unfit to carry out the task. A defiance of authority since the tormented 1990s has intoxicated political and social spheres and reared its ugly head in football too. Many ultras took part in the armed conflicts and carry their scars today, translating the tribal nature of the Yugoslav wars to their clubs and ultras groups. Partizan have repeatedly attempted to ban a number of ultras but to no avail owing to a mixture of anxiousness over making decisions, and a shortage of means to implement them. Some came back proudly announcing themselves as The Forbidden Ones and regularly clash internally with other factions of the Grobari. The Serbian football federation appeared equally powerless in Italy four years ago when hooligans led the referee Craig Thomson to abandon a Euro 2012 qualifier after seven minutes. The ministry of sports went so far as to attempt to prosecute 14 fan organisations at once but the charges were finally dropped after ministers moved on to other positions. Enforcing ground bans is easier when clubs are able to pay their employees. Despite winning the league every year between 2008 and 2013 and selling players every summer, Partizan struggle financially. Red Star cannot even afford their stadium\u2019s floodlights. Serbia\u2019s recent friendly against France was shifted to Partizan\u2019s stadium which was described by Serbia\u2019s manager Dick Advocaat as \u201clooking a 100 years old\u201d. For these clubs, financial sustainability comes before acting against their ultras. The problem is not confined to Serbia as highlighted by the 56 Paris Saint-Germain hooligans apprehended in Amsterdam last week, but the Serbian authorities simply do not have the clout to deal with the ultras. Red Star were expelled from the Champions League in June for breaching financial fair play, making it even more difficult for the club to pay their staff and players. Last Friday, Michel Platini unveiled the Euro 2020 hosts with the surprise inclusion of Azerbaijan\u2019s capital Baku, a city the Uefa president has visited on several occasions. Belgrade\u2019s bid included the construction of a national stadium and upgrade of facilities but it failed to make the cut. Azerbaijan was also spared once more from being drawn with Armenia in Euro 2016 qualifying with Uefa citing the dispute between the countries over Nagorno-Karabakh to justify its decision. Yet Serbia and Albania are at odds over Kosovo but they have been paired together. The first game between both nations is scheduled in Belgrade on 14 October and will doubtless lead to nationalist sentiments from the past again being thrown into the limelight. The problems will not go away until there is a joint effort from Uefa, the Serbian authorities and the clubs.

A model and actor, she stars in the romantic comedy Love, Rosie, out on 22 October, and recently finished filming the sci-fi thriller Insurgent, out next year. Earlier this year, she attended the Oscars and the White House State Dinner with her boyfriend, the actor Bradley Cooper. She lives between Los Angeles and London. What did you like best about the Oscars? The pizza and [host] Ellen DeGeneres. I was cracking up the whole time; my cheeks actually hurt. I didn\u2019t expect the Oscars to be that fun. Was it difficult to move from modelling to acting? I am still making the move, but I think it\u2019s kind of natural. The way I see it, actors are taking all the modelling jobs; they are on all the magazines covers, get the best contracts and walk in the shows. I\u2019ve acted my whole life pretty much, but then just got more into modelling. I was scared of picking it up again, because it\u2019s such a difficult, soul-baring thing to do compared with modelling, where you just close yourself off. But it\u2019s made me really happy. Being on set reminds me of being at summer camp.     Suki Waterhouse in her latest film, Love, Rosie. Photograph: Allstar    Have you had an \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve made it\u2019 moment? No, and I think it\u2019s a misconception that anyone ever feels like that. Even when I\u2019m doing well, I still have moments when I think, \u201cUgh.\u201d When I feel like that, I do the thing I heard Albert Einstein did: say thank you 100 times. What\u2019s been the most glamorous moment of your career so far? The Met Ball was more glamorous than the Oscars. It\u2019s quite scary, because it\u2019s a last-minute thing, and everyone\u2019s dresses get made for them, so you get what you\u2019re given. But it turned out to be my favourite dress ever. It was by Burberry. I didn\u2019t get to keep it, but it was so large, it took up half the hotel room. When I called the bellboy to take it downstairs, he refused. What\u2019s been the least glamorous moment of your career so far? Whenever I am left to my own devices with cleaning and washing. When I was filming in Atlanta this summer, my apartment was disgusting. I learned to use the washing machine, but I don\u2019t see the point in using detergent. I stored things in my dishwasher. Have you been starstruck? When I met Julia Roberts, the only thing that came out my mouth was, \u201cThank you.\u201d What was the most surprising thing about your visit to the White House? I didn\u2019t expect to see Obama bopping to Mary J Blige. He can really dance. I got a tour of the Oval Office, which was pretty cool, especially because I love the TV show Scandal.     With Bradley Cooper at the Met Ball. Photograph: Billy Farrell/Rex    What was your fancy dress outfit of choice as a child? A skater boy. I wore the same outfit all the time: big cargo pants with big T-shirts with weird slogans like Bad Girls Never Die, and big jackets. I was very anti-pink. What\u2019s the most surprising track on your iTunes? I have a lot of Britney. We actually wanted to see her in Las Vegas [for Georgia May Jagger\u2019s birthday], but she wasn\u2019t playing, so we ended up seeing Celine Dion, which was a bit of a disappointment. What has been your biggest fashion faux pas? I am constantly faux pas-ing. I messed up at fashion week last year. I had five minutes to come home to change, and my mum was screaming at me that the taxi was waiting outside, so I just threw on the most hideous thing. I looked like I was wearing a jacket made of pubes \u2013 and there was photographic evidence. My problem is that what I like changes from week to week. Even the stuff in my suitcase right now I don\u2019t like any more. What makes you angry? Preconceived judgments. I think we\u2019re all guilty of it. I judge other people even though I get judged myself. It\u2019s such a disease and gets spread so much through social media. What makes you laugh? People falling off treadmills. I YouTube that all the time.     Kaya Scodelario: \u2018I still go to the shops in my pyjamas and walk my dog looking like crap.\u2019 Styling: Rachel Bakewell. Photograph: Jon Gorrigan/Guardian    Kaya Scodelario Scodelario, 22, grew up in London. At the age of 14, she was cast as Effy in the Channel 4 series Skins, and is the only actor to appear in all four series. She has since starred as Cathy in Andrea Arnold\u2019s Wuthering Heights, in Clash Of The Titans and Now Is Good. She appears in The Maze Runner, based on the bestselling books, out on 10 October, and The Moon And The Sun, out next year. What\u2019s the best thing about your job? I get to see places in the world I never thought I would. This year I\u2019ve been to Versailles, Australia and South Africa. I always try to make the most of wherever I am, and use the time off to do tourist stuff and take pictures for my mum. What\u2019s the worst thing about your job? Being away from home, which I know contradicts what I just said. It gets very lonely when you\u2019re away for a long time, living out of a suitcase. What are your must-haves on set? Diet Coke, because I don\u2019t drink tea or coffee, and my French bulldog Arnie. There\u2019s always someone willing to look after him.     Scodelario with Dylan O\u2019Brien in The Maze Runner. Photograph: Alamy/Allstar    What\u2019s the biggest difference between British and American actors? They\u2019re more tanned? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure there is one. I always feel like a Londoner whenever I am in that world, though. Hollywood is absolutely as ridiculous as it seems. For instance? I went to the Vanity Fair Oscar party as a plus-one with my director friend, Francesca Gregorini. It was so overwhelming that, after a while, I had to sit in a corner on my own. You couldn\u2019t look around without spotting someone. I just wanted to go home and ring my mum. Have you had an \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve made it\u2019 moment? I will feel that way when I manage to buy my mum a house.     Kaya wears shirt, \u00a355, cosstores.com. Tweed shift, \u00a369.90, benetton.com. Photograph: Jon Gorrigan/Guardian    What\u2019s been the most glamorous moment of your career so far? I\u2019m not a very glamorous person. On my last job I was working with Pierce Brosnan, and we took him to the opera for his 61st birthday. I\u2019d never been before and going with Piercey was really cool. Then I took him back to my roots: we took him to a dingy bar and got him hammered. What\u2019s been the least glamorous moment of your career so far? Everything. I still go to the shops in my pyjamas and walk my dog looking like crap. Everyone who knows me knows I have flatulence problems. I\u2019m quite proud of it, though. Have you been starstruck? All the time. If I ever see anyone off EastEnders, I freak, but the most was when I was in Paris for fashion week and Ronnie Wood walked through my hotel. I just froze. My friend encouraged me, so I chased him around the hotel. He turned around and I just burst out crying and said, \u201cThank you for the music\u201d, which is the cheesiest thing I have ever said in my life. He was very sweet. He hugged me and asked if I was OK, because I was sobbing, and I just walked off. I was a mess. What\u2019s the naughtiest thing you\u2019ve done? I was on Skins, for God\u2019s sake. What\u2019s the greatest lesson your mother taught you? Everything, but particularly how to be a strong woman, because she raised me on her own. She came to England from Brazil when she was 26, and built herself a career and a home without speaking the language or knowing anyone. She has really inspired me to be independent and not need a man to get through life. What was your fancy dress oufit of choice as a child? Posh Spice \u2013 I was obsessed with the Spice Girls. What is your phone wallpaper? My friends and me in New York for my 21st. I\u2019ve been friends with these three girls since school, and I\u2019d always wanted to have my 21st in New York. So that\u2019s what we did. What do you series link? My mum and I have a little tradition of watching Grey\u2019s Anatomy together. She saves them up while I\u2019m working; when I\u2019m home, we\u2019ll watch them for three days straight. What makes you laugh? My dog. He has learnt to do roly-polies and now he won\u2019t stop. He just travels everywhere through the medium of roly-poly. When does fame get uncomfortable? The whole idea of fame is uncomfortable. It\u2019s not what you should want from this job. It makes me sad to see my younger cousins, the Instagram generation, obsessed with what people look like and what someone else has got. I just always loved the work. I try not to be wrapped up in my own dramas, because actress dramas are silly. My friend has just had a baby, and has a seven-year-old: her dramas are important.     Holliday Grainger: \u2018 As a kid, I thought I\u2019d do something proper like writing or directing or producing. Acting is not a real job, is it?\u2019 Styling: Rachel Bakewell Photograph: Jon Gorrigan/Guardian    Holliday Grainger Grainger, 26, grew up in Didsbury, Manchester. She gave up studying for an English degree at Leeds University to pursue acting; she subsequently got a first from the Open University. She has starred in Jane Eyre, the TV series The Borgias and in Mike Newell\u2019s Great Expectations as Estella. She is currently starring in The Riot Club, next year appears in Tulip Fever and Cinderella, and has just started filming the lead in Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover for the BBC. Who is your acting inspiration? Cate Blanchett. After working with her [on Cinderella], I can say she is actually the image of feminine perfection. She has her really lovely kids on set, is super professional, incredibly intelligent and nice to everyone. I think she might actually be a perfect human being. What are you must-haves on set? A bottle of water, my sides [mini-scripts] and some chewing gum \u2013 you have to get up close in people\u2019s face all the time and you might have just eaten some onions. What\u2019s the hardest thing about your job? Realising that a lot of it isn\u2019t acting. You spend such a short amount of time on set in character, compared with the nerves, the preparation for audition and then all the press stuff. It was hard coming to terms with the fact that this is all part of the job.     In Great Expectations. Photograph: Allstar    What\u2019s the biggest difference between British and American actors? A director once told me that Americans focus on a scene whereas Brits focus on the project as a whole. I am not sure if I agree, but I suppose British actors tend to be a bit more earnest in their research, they treat it as a craft, and Americans go to acting class more. So Brits are more cerebral and Americans are more practical. Have you had an \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve made it\u2019 moment? When I finished my degree, I had a lot of work lined up and I freaked out. I was like, \u2018Oh my God, I am actually an actor.\u2019 As a kid, I thought I\u2019d do something proper like writing or directing or producing. Acting is not a real job, is it? I pretend to be someone else for a living. How do you handle being naked on set? I just don\u2019t think of myself as sexy, so it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s like when toddlers get naked. When wardrobe come up to me with a towelling robe after a naked scene, I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, everyone\u2019s just seen it, it really doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I get a little excited when I get to take off my clothes on costume dramas. The sets are usually boiling hot and I\u2019ve been in a corset all day, and I get to take it all off and lie on a bed, and I think, \u201cAhhh, I can do this.\u201d Have you ever been starstruck? I froze when I walked past Judi Dench at Pinewood. All I could do was hold the door open and squeak, \u201cHello.\u201d Thank God [co-star] Jack O\u2019Connell was coming up behind me and introduced himself. So then I could mention I was also starring in Tulip Fever with her. I put on a posh voice. It\u2019s Judi Dench. She is a proper lady. What\u2019s been the most glamorous moment of your career so far? Going to the Baftas. Where else do you see so many people in so many beautiful dresses? It\u2019s like a fairytale. What\u2019s been the least glamorous moment of your career so far? I spent a day on Tulip Fever plucking chickens and gutting fish. I played a 15th-century maid and the director and I thought it would be boring if I was just cleaning the whole time.     With Max Irons in The Riot Club. Photograph: Allstar    What was your fancy dress outfit of choice as a child? Peter Pan. He lives between Victorian London and a fairytale world, mermaids fancy him and he can fly. He is cool. I had a Peter Pan T-shirt that I would wear with a belt, wellies and leggings. What\u2019s the most surprising track on your iTunes?I have some breathing exercises from the voice coach Penny Dyer that begin \u201cHello, Holliday\u201d in a quite breathy voice. If I have my iTunes on shuffle and that comes on, it scares the shit out of me. What was the last selfie you took? On the set of Tulip Fever. It\u2019s set in 1600s Amsterdam and we wore these ridiculous hats that look like penises. There were also a lot of pigs\u2019 heads on set, with their eyes vaguely open, so I took a picture of myself licking a pig\u2019s head in my knobhead cap. What\u2019s been your biggest fashion faux pas? The whole Peter Pan obsession fed into my teenage years. I wore a lot of floaty dresses and boots in all shades of green. I was 19 and refusing to grow up. What makes you angry? Racism makes me burn with anger. When you are a liberal-minded person living in a multicultural society surrounded by similar people, you forget that it isn\u2019t the norm. So when I was in the Deep South, I would be having a drink with someone and they\u2019d say something that would make my blood run cold. What makes you laugh? My nana\u2019s laugh and my mum when she has a giggling fit. Why was it so important to continue your degree after your acting career took off? Because I thought my acting was never going to last, and I had been saving up for it my entire life. I had to work pretty hard. There were a few afternoons of crying in coffee shops, writing essays in between acting jobs, when I wondered what I was doing. But I am proud of myself for seeing it through.", "sentences": ["It\u2019s set in 1600s Amsterdam and we wore these ridiculous hats that look like penises."], "title": "The new Brit pack: UK actors storm LA", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/27/-sp-new-brit-pack-uk-actors-storm-la-waterhouse-scodelario-grainger", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Fashion", "Life and style", "The Riot Club", "Drama", "Drama", "Television", "Television & radio", "Thriller", "Science fiction and fantasy"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-28T09:00:00Z", "article": "Sally, 29, lives and works in London  I&apos;d never dabbled in casual sex until Tinder. I was a serial monogamist, moving from one long-term relationship to the next. I had friends who&apos;d indulged in one-night stands and was probably guilty of judging them a little, of slut-shaming. I saw the negatives \u2013 that merry-go-round of hook-ups and guys never calling again. Then, in February 2013, my partner dumped me. We&apos;d only been together eight months but I was serious, deeply in love, and seven months of celibacy followed. By summer, I needed something to take the pain away. Big loves don&apos;t come every day. Instead of &quot;boyfriend hunting&quot;, searching for an exact copy of my ex, why not get out there, enjoy dating, have a good laugh \u2013 and, if I felt a connection, some good sex too? I could be married in five years and I&apos;d never experimented before. This was my chance to see what all the fuss was about. There&apos;s a hierarchy of seriousness on the dating sites. At the top is something like Guardian Soulmates or Match \u2013 the ones you pay for. At the lower end are the likes of OKCupid or PlentyOfFish (POF) which are free, more casual and less &quot;Where do you see yourself in 10 years&apos; time?&quot; I started with OKCupid but the problem was that any creep can message you out of the blue \u2013 I quickly moved to Tinder because both parties need to indicate they&apos;re attracted before either can get in touch. It&apos;s playful. You put in your pictures and add some information if you can be bothered. I started with one line &quot;Single Canadian girl in London&quot;. It&apos;s superficial, based purely on physical attraction, but that&apos;s what I was looking for. You go through what&apos;s there, if you see someone you like, you swipe right. If he swipes you too, it lights up like a game, then asks if you want to keep playing. My first Tinder date was with someone I&apos;d seen before on OKCupid \u2013 the same faces crop up on all these sites. &quot;Amsterdam&quot; was a hip, scenester guy with an amazing job. He knew all the cool restaurants, the best places and, as he was only in London occasionally, things moved faster than they should have. After just a few dates, he booked us a night in a fancy Kensington hotel. I met him at a pub first \u2013 liquid courage \u2013 and knew the second I saw him that my heart wasn&apos;t in it. The connection wasn&apos;t there for me. But he was a sweet guy who was paying \u00a3300 for the room and, though he&apos;d never have forced me, it was the first time in my life I&apos;ve felt obliged to have sex with someone. Not a great start. But Tinder is addictive. You find yourself browsing and swiping and playing on. The possibilities pile up. I&apos;m ashamed to say it but I sometimes went on three or four dates a week. It could be to a bar around the corner, or somewhere fabulous \u2013 Berner&apos;s Tavern, the Chiltern Firehouse. Most of the guys I met were looking for sex, rarely were they after a relationship. With Tinder, I discovered what it could be to have sex then walk away without a backward glance. That was liberating. Sex didn&apos;t have to be wrapped up with commitment, and &quot;will he?/won&apos;t he?&quot;. It could just be fun. Sometimes I had nothing in common with the guy but there was a sexual spark. &quot;NottingHill&quot; was one of those. In &quot;real life&quot;, he was the ultimate knob. He didn&apos;t fit with my politics, my views, I&apos;d never have introduced him to my friends. In bed, though, he was passionate, eager, energetic. For a while, we&apos;d hook up every six weeks. &quot;French Guy&quot; was another positive \u2013 I found out what the fuss about French lovers was all about. But there were a lot of negatives. It could feel \u2026 seedy. Where do you go for sex? I didn&apos;t feel comfortable taking someone back to my place, as he&apos;d then know where I lived, and I live alone. If we went back to his, I&apos;d have no idea what to expect. With &quot;Aldgate East&quot;, we had to walk through a pub to get to the bedroom and I swear there was a train going through the lounge. You&apos;re trusting people you barely know. After a few dates with &quot;Manchester&quot;, I agreed to visit his hotel room next time he was in London. I&apos;d always been diligent about practising safe sex, but he had trouble getting in the mood with the condoms and went against my wishes at the last moment. The next morning I wrote him an angry text. He replied that he would wire me \u00a340 for the morning-after pill. I&apos;ve never felt so violated. Most often, though, I didn&apos;t have sex at all. Of the 57 men I met in a year, I probably had sex with about 10%-15%. I generally left home open to the possibility but found, when my date showed up, that I didn&apos;t want to see him again, let alone see him naked. There was no spark, or he was dull or gross or just too pushy. One date chased me to the tube trying to shove his tongue down my throat. Another \u2013 who started promisingly \u2013 changed after his second drink, spilling a glass of wine on me without apologising, and cutting me off each time I spoke. It can be harder to walk away when you&apos;ve met through Tinder. When you&apos;re matched, you can spend days \u2013 in some cases, weeks, months \u2013 exchanging messages, texting and working yourselves up, filling in the gaps with your imagination. By the time you meet, you&apos;ve both invested so much, you&apos;ve raised your hopes and his. In some ways Tinder can even work against you finding a partner. I met one guy who was a likely contender for a boyfriend. &quot;Eton&quot; was hot, hilarious, he spoke five languages \u2013 everything on my wish list. Our dates weren&apos;t fancy \u2013 we probably spent \u00a310 between the two of us \u2013 but each time I met him, my cheeks would literally hurt from so much smiling. We went on five dates without sex, just a kiss and a hug. Then one night, he arrived at my place stinking of booze and likely high on something. The sex was over in seconds \u2013 a massive anticlimax after such a build-up. We never saw each other again. If we&apos;d met another way, that could have been a blip, an awkward beginning. On Tinder everything&apos;s disposable, there&apos;s always more, you move on fast. You start browsing again, he starts browsing \u2013 and you can see when anyone was last on it. If five days pass with no messaging between you, it&apos;s history. At times, Tinder seemed less like fun, more like a gruelling trek across an arid desert of small talk and apathetic texting. More than once, I deleted the app, but always came back to it. It was more addictive than gambling. I never dreamed I&apos;d end up dating 57 men in less than a year. I&apos;m off it now. Four months ago, I met a man \u2013 &quot;Hackney Boy&quot; \u2013 through Tinder and at first, I carried on seeing him and dating others. After a while, he wanted to get more serious. He&apos;s older than me and didn&apos;t want to waste time with Tinder any more. I had one last fling with &quot;French Guy&quot;, then made a decision to stop. What did Tinder give me? I had the chance to live the Sex and the City fantasy. It has made me less judgmental and changed my attitude to monogamy too. I used to be committed to it \u2013 now I think, if it&apos;s just sex, a one-night hook-up, where&apos;s the harm? I&apos;m more open to the idea of swinging, open relationships, which is something I&apos;d never have expected. At the same time, it has taught me the value of true connection. It&apos;s really obvious when you have it, and usually, you don&apos;t. I hate to say it, but sex in a relationship beats casual sex. Yes, the rush of meeting someone new \u2013 new bed, new bodies \u2013 can, occasionally, be great. More often though, you find yourself yearning for a nice partner who loves you and treats you well.", "sentences": ["&quot;Amsterdam&quot; was a hip, scenester guy with an amazing job."], "title": "'How Tinder took me from serial monogamy to casual sex'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/28/tinder-serial-monogamy-casual-sex", "tags": ["Dating", "Sex", "Sexuality", "Apps", "Society", "Life and style", "Technology", "Tinder"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-28T09:00:15Z", "article": "So, here we go. A new book by David Nicholls is now an event that measures pretty near a 10 on the publishing industry Richter scale. Yet for all the magnitude of hype that will herald its arrival, Us is in some ways quite a gentle book. It doesn\u2019t scream about itself, but is no worse for that. Us is the story of a family. It is the story of Douglas Petersen, his marriage to Connie, and their teenage son Albie. They go on holiday. A trip around Europe by train. They visit the major cities of Europe \u2013 Paris, Amsterdam, Venice and so on \u2013 but, as with the mega-selling One Day, what it is really about is the two biggest subjects, love and time. Things are coming to an end. One way or another this will be the last family holiday for the Petersens. Yet while One Day was about people who should be together but, for the most part, don\u2019t realise it, Us is kind of about the opposite. Douglas and Connie are together, but possibly shouldn\u2019t be. This is certainly what Connie thinks, when she declares that she wants a divorce. Or at least thinks she does. Added to that, Albie is about to leave home and go to university. There is something intrinsically funny about holidaying relatives that makes for good comic fiction \u2013 think Greene\u2019s Travels With My Aunt or the awkward family holiday to Africa in Jennifer Egan\u2019s A Visit from the Goon Squad. The Amsterdam section, in particular, is full of laughs. Poor Douglas has inadvertently booked the family into a sex hotel, triggers a whole row of bikes and motorbikes to domino to the ground, and narrowly escapes a beating by running into a prostitute\u2019s red-lit townhouse. It could almost be National Lampoon\u2019s European Vacation. Yet the keynote here is poignancy, not laughter. Douglas isn\u2019t just a fish-out-of-water on foreign soil. He is a misfit in his own family. Whereas Connie is the ultimate liberal parent, and Albie is an experimental, messy, cool 17-year-old with a passion for leftfield photography, Douglas is resolutely not those things. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of having been relaxed at any time in my entire life,\u201d he says, almost as a boast. It is Douglas\u2019s character that makes this book. An uptight 54-year-old who doesn\u2019t like spicy food, or spicy anything. But there is emotion here, flowing under his oppressive reasonableness. For instance, we learn, quite early, that Albie had a sibling, who died shortly after birth. During the holiday Douglas ruminates deeply on this and other incidents in their past, to try to understand how things went wrong in his relationship with\u00a0Connie. Douglas is almost heroically unromantic. At one point, after inadvertently stealing some soft mints at Munich airport, he becomes determined. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying, cited in popular culture, that if you love someone you must set them free. Well, that\u2019s just nonsense. If you love them you bind them in heavy chains.\u201d It is not a perfect novel. In place of the high concept narrative neatness of One Day, Douglas\u2019s soul-searching means that here we get a lot of flashbacks. All this time-gazing can become slightly arduous and the forward-back rhythm can become monotonous at times. But in most ways, I think Nicholls has raised his game. This is a grownup book, and one deserving of its Man Booker\u00a0longlisting. Nicholls\u2019s gift is character. There is a sharp empathetic intelligence to his writing that makes his characters real. He is far from a stylistic show-off \u2013 his intelligence isn\u2019t worn on his sleeve, but the clear writing often dazzles with\u00a0truth. Yes, it is an easy book to read. Yes, it will sell millions. Yes, some people who don\u2019t know any better will be snobby about it. But there is real philosophical depth amid the entertainment. Nicholls has a feel for the big stuff, even as he zooms in on the soft mints, making this a sad, funny, soulful joy of a book. Matt Haig\u2019s The Humans is out now in paperback (Canongate).

Free from any Christian identification of sex with sin, Shun\u2019ei here offers an erotic luxury. As you unfurl the scroll, detailed and beautifully coloured scenes of lovemaking reveal themselves.

V&amp;A Collection    Andrea Riccio  Satyr and Satyress   (1510-1520) V&amp;A, London In Greek and Roman mythology satyrs are goat-legged followers of the wine god Bacchus, hairy votaries of sex, dance and ecstasy. In Renaissance art they are walking penises, embodiments of lust, who chase nymphs or spy on sleeping goddesses. Here, however, the brilliant craftsman Riccio imagines a satyr couple, tenderly embracing in some balmy woodland nook. Being half goat, they are all desire. Love is wild.     The Tate    Picasso  The Kiss   (1967) Tate, London When Picasso draws or paints a kiss - and he returned insatiably to this subject - it is no chaste romantic touch of lips but a carnal encounter of tongues. The oral entangling in this late work by the most sexual of artists is impossible to misunderstand. Clearly it is not so much a kiss he is portraying as an ecstatic allegory of all the copulations he can remember or imagine.     Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest    Egon Schiele Two Women Embracing (1915) Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest Egon Schiele is a great artist who found his subject in the bedroom. In the last days of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the father of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud was researching sexuality and Gustav Klimt was painting sensual dreams. Young Schiele took this respect for sex to a new level in superbly drawn masterpieces like this depiction of women in love. He turns his erotic curiosity into moving, beautiful, arousing art that may well be the most sublime pornography ever created.     \u00a9Jeff Koons/Whitney Museum of MA    Jeff Koons Made in Heaven (1991) Whitney Museum, New York When Jeff Koons married porn star and (later) Italian MP Ilona Staller (Cicciolina) he marked their union in a series of works, including this poster, as well as glassware and sculptures of them having sex. The imagery is indistinguishable from porn with Koons identifying himself with pop culture at its most shameless.     The Tate    Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec   In Bed, the Kiss  (1892) Desire is beautiful. Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s portrayal of two women in bed is intimate and frank, and free from all the prejudices we ascribe to his age. Toulouse-Lautrec lived among and regularly portrayed the prostitutes, dancers and artists\u2019 models of Montmartre. His pastels recording the real lives of his women friends are his true masterpieces. Love is easy, and love is free.     The National Gallery     After Michelangelo Leda and the Swan (After 1530) National Gallery, London There are strong hints of homosexuality as well as fellatio in this depiction of Leda making love to a swan. In ancient myth, Jupiter took the form of a swan to seduce Leda. Such myths were transformed by Renaissance artists such as Titian into alluring sensual painting. Michelangelo provocatively makes the coupling real. The model for Leda was his assistant Antonio Mini. The work barely conceals Michelangelo\u2019s fantasy \u2013 or record \u2013 of his own penis meeting Mini\u2019s mouth.     Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam    Rembrandt The French Bed (1646) Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam Images of sex abound in Renaissance and baroque art, usually in mythic couplings of woman and cloud, boy and eagle.

The multimedia extravaganza brought beauty and wisdom to Adelaide for its Australian premiere at the OzAsia festival. Born in segregation with lament close to its heart, Nu Shu is the script developed over hundreds of years by Jian-yong county women in Tan\u2019s own Hunan province to communicate their feelings to one another, and remained exclusively in their domain until it neared extinction.  Rediscovered in 1982, the secret language has been the focus of a documentary, books, film and even a Guinness world record. Now Tan Dun\u2019s inventive piece, five years in the making, seeks to weave heartrending stories of Nu Shu women through song and historical context.  In another Australian premiere, Tan Dun first reveals his Symphonic Poem on Three Notes, conducting the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra with metal percussion soloist Chenchu Rong. Composed to pay tribute to Tan\u2019s friend Pl\u00e1cido Domingo on his 70th birthday, the musical theme forms on three solf\u00e8ge syllables, which, rapped repeatedly by the orchestra, calls the singer\u2019s name. Chenchu\u2019s cadenza is spectacular as the barefoot artist masterfully works her kit, which includes three metal rim car wheels. She delivers mechanical precision with an elegant style, while Tan\u2019s mathematical, spiritual composition sees an inspired orchestra stomping and chanting to a dramatic climax. Tan Dun then conducts B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Miraculous Mandarin suite, illustrating its \u201cpantomime grotesque\u201d storyline with passion.  Three screens are set after the interval before harp ambassador Elizabeth Hainen takes to the stage. Nu Shu: The Secret Songs of Women marries 13 micro-films shot on location in Hunan province (most in a single take) to 13 musical movements, composed and directed by Tan Dun. The first movement, Secret Fan, opens with mosquito strings (visually, the Nu Shu script resembles mosquito legs), but when Hainen\u2019s harp comes in, its strong and personal timbre serves to link the history of the language to the voice of the orchestra. Some sections are particularly confronting. The sixth film, Longing For Her Sister, shows a close-up of an elderly women crying and singing. It\u2019s evocative but invasive, reflected by melancholy strings that ultimately yield to the full orchestra and some sweeping brass. Strong rhythms, water elements (rivers and tears), and Nu Shu\u2019s heartbeat theme \u2013 \u201cta-dum\u201d \u2013 hold our focus. Amplified droplets add to the soundtrack as this orchestral heartbeat intensifies before a vividly hopeful final movement.  Despite Tan Dun\u2019s assertion that he is more artist than archaeologist, Nu Shu: The Secret Songs of Women works on many levels, recording a culture and its traditions while also paying respect to their deep sense of honour. It\u2019s a retrospective reflection that may just reveal the secrets of Nu Shu to future generations. \u2022 Tan Dun will conduct harpist Petra Van Der Heide for the European premiere of Secret Songs with the Royal Concertgebouw orchestra, 29-30 January 2015, in Amsterdam.", "sentences": ["\u2022 Tan Dun will conduct harpist Petra Van Der Heide for the European premiere of Secret Songs with the Royal Concertgebouw orchestra, 29-30 January 2015, in Amsterdam."], "title": "Nu Shu: The Secret Songs of Women review \u2013 ancient words live again", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/sep/29/nu-shu-the-secret-songs-of-women-adelaide-review", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Australia news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-29T12:23:03Z", "article": "In recent years, Amsterdam has earned a reputation as a genuine smart city. Not because it is pioneering technological urbanism \u2013 building megastructures filled with interconnected digital sensors and robots \u2013 but rather, as urban sociologist Saskia Sassen puts it, because the city actively urbanises technology.  In other words, Amsterdam has got very good at melding previously disparate systems of data, technology, energy and mobility through government, business and citizen-led initiatives.  Mobility and food have emerged as important pillars of the city\u2019s quest for smart sustainability. Earlier this year, the city council presented its new food vision, a strategy intended to create a more sustainable and economically-strong food system. One of its main priorities is transport, whereby distribution is done by cleaner vehicles doing fewer miles. With a large chunk of the transport network taken up with urban food distribution \u2013 15 million annual food miles in Amsterdam alone \u2013 there is work to be done. While large food and drink wholesalers are now using electric trucks for distribution, and the country\u2019s largest supermarkets are using them for home deliveries, the products delivered by these big players do not necessarily promote the production and consumption of locally-sourced quality food. And it doesn\u2019t solve the issue of congestion: Amsterdam\u2019s urban core \u2013 much of it pre-18th century \u2013 is not built for cars, let alone heavier transport.     Amsterdam is famous for its bicycle-friendly culture and infrastructure, which has inspired its new food transportation initiative. Photograph: Graeme Robertson    But alternatives are entering the arena \u2013 and not only from existing large businesses or public/private partnerships. This month saw the launch of Foodlogica, which aims to contribute to the localised food system by providing affordable zero-emissions transport and less traffic congestion. This urban delivery service uses solar-powered electric tricycles for the final link in the food distribution system, as well as aiming to shorten the chain between local food producers and sellers. Running a small pilot since June, Foodlogica is working with six environmentally-conscious local food businesses, using two electric trikes working out of transport hubs. Three of these businesses sell produce from local and regional farmers to supermarkets, workplaces and households, and Foodlogica is expanding its client base at a rapid rate. Beginning life as a lean startup, it hopes to become a model for sustainable urban food transportation around the world.  \u201cOnce we\u2019re up and running, and when we have acquired more clients, we will scale up,\u201d says the company\u2019s founder, Francesca Miazzo. \u201cWe are talking to big parties who do thousands of weekly deliveries and are interested to have part of that delivered in a smart way.\u201d Foodlogica\u2019s transport hubs, each consisting of a recycled shipping container equipped with solar panels to charge the two e-trikes, will be located at strategic locations across the city where incoming food is transferred to the urban delivery system. The first station was placed at the Amsterdam Food Centre \u2013 the city\u2019s main food distribution node \u2013 and from there the tricycles carry out the deliveries into the urban centre.     The Foodlogica e-tricycle provides affordable zero-emission urban food transport. Photograph: Mark Minkjan    \u201cIdeally, we\u2019ll have four transport hubs in various spots around Amsterdam in a year from now,\u201d Miazzo says. If this proves possible in Amsterdam\u2019s constricted urban environment, the system could easily be duplicated in other cities around the world. Miazzo is not new to the local food world. She co-founded CITIES Foundation, whose Farming the City project was created in 2010 to map and research Amsterdam\u2019s urban food initiatives, as well as explore how local food systems contribute to more resilient cities around the world. One of the project\u2019s findings was that transport in Amsterdam remains a barrier to sustainability and efficiency. The research identified a need for swift, flexible urban food transport not hampered by traffic jams and one-way streets; hence Foodlogica\u2019s e-trikes.  \u201cIt\u2019s not only a delivery service,\u201d Miazzo explains. \u201cYou should see it as a platform for good food companies from Amsterdam, bringing them together and showcasing them.\u201d Mark Minkjan is editor-in-chief at Failed Architecture and part of Non-fiction.

New technologies have made my second business, Charlotte &amp; Co, a relative nirvana to grow. We are an e-commerce business but we have no tech know-how in house. Our website runs on an open-source Magento platform and it never occurs to me to worry whether the site is up or down. It is utterly stable, always has been. When e-commerce works, you are not spending on the increasingly expensive, increasingly rare high street locations that are still economically viable. Instead, we are free to invest in the parts of the business that the customer cares about: beautifully designed, high quality lingerie and lounge wear, and outstanding personal customer service. We do not invest in expensive office space either because very few of our team actually come into the office to work. Instead we are enthusiastic users of remote working technologies: VoIP is an integral part of our daily processes. In fact, it has killed off the curse of big businesses: the hour-long meeting. We recruit new team members in a location-blind manner via online forums and platforms such as People per Hour. Our financial director is still known as Charles S because that was how LinkedIn had shortened his name when we first went looking for someone to take the financial reins. We can test new markets quickly and cheaply too; thank you Amazon for allowing us to discover that our designer pyjamas are a hit with the Germans. With Dropbox and WeTransfer, we can use a supplier base that is as global as that of any multinational. We are manufacturing in Asia and Portugal, re-touching photography in India, using reprographic services in Leeds and printing our catalogues in Germany, all without ever getting on a plane. And it feels seamless. I am the CEO yet I also find time to create a hundred designs for each new collection. When I brief out a creative project I am as likely to hire a textile print designer in Amsterdam as in London. The team&apos;s productivity is enhanced massively by our cultural emphasis on asynchronous communication \u2013 also known as email. Email is particularly valuable because we work with partners across time zones and with colleagues who work remotely and do not work the same hours as each other. This way of working has allowed us to tap the vast reservoir of highly skilled women who, for whatever reason, are no longer prepared to commit to a traditional corporate lifestyle. We do all this without having an IT department and with a fraction of the number of people we would have needed a decade ago. The most complex machine in our office has a Nespresso logo on it. I cannot help but believe that many corporates must look at how much we achieve with so little resource and want to weep into their plastic cups of insipid vending machine coffee.

But the US secret service\u2019s history of blunders extends much further back than this week. Over the past five years, there have been a series of 16 cases of intruders scaling the White House fence, and a 2011 incident involving a White House shooting while President Obama\u2019s daughter was home.   Here are a list of the agency\u2019s top slip-ups and scandals from FDR to the present: 2011 White House shooting  New details emerged recently in the Washington Post that the secret service mishandled the investigation after a man shot at the White House while Obama\u2019s youngest daughter, Sasha, was home. According to the Post, at least seven bullets hit the building: one pierced a window on the second floor, another hit a nearby window frame and several more pinged the roof. The president and first lady were not in the mansion at the time, but Sasha, and Michelle\u2019s mother, Marian Robinson, were. Malia was reportedly expected to return at any moment. An agent stationed upstairs apparently responded to the shooting, but was ordered to stand down by a supervisor who said no shots were fired. Secret service agents only realized the mansion had been hit four days later, when a housekeeper found broken glass on the floor.  The gunman, troubled 21-year-old Oscar Ortega-Hernandez, was eventually arrested and sentenced to 25 years in prison.  Partying in Amsterdam In March 2013, three agents who were assigned to the president\u2019s security detail in Amsterdam were sent home after a hotel employee reportedly found an agent drunk in the hallway a day before Obama arrived. The hotel reported the drunk agent to the US embassy in the Netherlands and the agents were immediately placed on administrative leave. Reports also emerged that same month that two of the agency\u2019s men had drunkenly wrecked their rental car in the Florida Keys. The agency instituted a new rule that employees must be sober for at least 12 hours before a shift begins, the Washington Post reported.  Colombian prostitution scandal In 2012, a prostitution scandal involving the president\u2019s security detail tarnished the agency\u2019s reputation and embarrassed the president, who was in Colombia for the annual Summit of the Americas.  A dozen secret service agents were implicated in the scandal, which was made public after reports emerged of a dispute over payment between a woman and a secret service agent in the resort of Cartagena. At the time, the incident raised concerns that the agents\u2019 trysts might have jeopardized the president\u2019s security, leading to several investigations and questions over its culture. It was later determined that the president\u2019s safety was not at risk. In the aftermath of the scandal, the agency tightened its standards of conduct, which included banning agents from \u201cnon-reputable establishments\u201d including strip clubs, and bringing foreign nationals to their hotel rooms, CBS reported.  White House gatecrashers In 2009, a woman being filmed for Bravo\u2019s The Real Housewives of DC and her husband finessed their way past two security checkpoints to attend Obama\u2019s first state dinner, uninvited.  Michaele and Tareq Salahi managed to enter the state dinner for then-Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, despite having to show a photo ID.  The show\u2019s cameramen reportedly followed Michaele, who wore a traditional Indian sari, as she prepared for the dinner. The cameramen did not follow the couple into the house, but in the episode featuring the evening, the Salahis recount the dinner and meeting Obama.  Embarrassingly, there are photos of the uninvited couple posing with Joe Biden and other attendees. The Salahis have stuck to their story that they received an official invitation, but the White House denies these claims.      President Obama greets Michaele and Tareq Salahi before a dinner with Indian PM Manmohan Singh in November 2009. Photograph: Samantha Appleton/AFP/Getty Images    Emergency landing One of the most outrageous attempts to breach White House security occurred in February 1974, when US soldier Robert Preston stole a helicopter from Fort Meade in Maryland and flew it to the White House. Preston hovered over the White House for several minutes before landing on the south lawn. The secret service did not initially attempt to shoot down the aircraft, according to a White House security review. Preston took off again and flew back toward Maryland. He was then chased by Maryland state police helicopters, one of which he out-maneuvered. Preston then flew back to the mansion, and as he lowered the helicopter, secret service agents sprayed the aircraft with shotguns and sub-machine gunfire. Slightly injured, Preston quickly landed the stolen helicopter and was apprehended.  President Nixon and his wife were not home at the time. Pass the popcorn One evening in the 1940s, Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s eldest son, Jimmy, was at the White House, on leave from second world war duty. The story goes that after dinner he and his parents decided to watch a movie. When the credits rolled and the lights flicked on, a neatly dressed stranger was in the room standing next to the 32nd president of the United States.  Harry Truman\u2019s daughter Margaret, who wrote about the incident in her book The President\u2019s House, a history of the White House, said: \u201cInstead of brandishing a weapon, however, the interloper asked for the president\u2019s autograph.\u201d FDR gave the young man his autograph and the embarrassed secret service agents \u2013 whom the young man had to pass to enter the private area of the mansion \u2013 escorted him out of the building.", "sentences": ["Partying in Amsterdam In March 2013, three agents who were assigned to the president\u2019s security detail in Amsterdam were sent home after a hotel employee reportedly found an agent drunk in the hallway a day before Obama arrived."], "title": "Secret service slip-ups: a handy guide to the agency's most famous blunders", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/secret-service-slip-ups-guide-white-house", "tags": ["Obama administration", "US news", "US politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-09-30T22:21:22Z", "article": "The US secret service allowed an armed man with an arrest record to enter an elevator with president Barack Obama, it was disclosed on Tuesday, hours after officials admitted they missed three chances to deter an intruder who broke into the White House earlier this month. The Washington Post revealed that the man, a security contractor, was carrying a gun when he was in the elevator with Obama on a 16 September visit to the US Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.  Earlier on Tuesday, the director of the secret service, Julia Pierson, faced a barrage of questions about the White House intrusion at a congressional hearing. The hearing was told that Omar Gonzalez, a former army sniper diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq, was first interviewed by the secret service after he was referred by local police worried by an arsenal of 11 heavy weapons and an annotated map pointing to the White House. On a second encounter, he was discovered walking around outside the White House fence with a hatchet, but was let go by secret service officers after he told them he was going camping. And on a third occasion, two officers spotted and recognised Gonzalez outside the White House again but failed to report him before he scaled the fence, ran unimpeded across the North Lawn and through three rooms of the residence just minutes after the departure of the president and his family.       The fresh evidence given to the House oversight committee for a hearing on Tuesday confirms officers provided misleading public statements after the event, claiming the intruder was unarmed and implying he did not make it past the front door, when in fact he barrelled past an agent who was trying to lock the door and made it more than 80 feet into the building with a three-inch serrated knife. He was eventually wrestled to the carpet and handcuffed by an off-duty officer who just happened to be passing through, according to fresh disclosures by a whistleblower to the Washington Post. Later on Tuesday, the Post disclosed details of the Atlanta security breach, which had not previously been revealed. The Post reported that the contractor failed to obey an order from secret service agents to stop filming the president on his camera phone, and a background check revealed he had an arrest record. The agents only realised he was carrying a gun when a supervisor from the private security company, on being told of agents\u2019 concerns, fired him on the spot. The man agreed to turn over his weapon. At the congressional hearing, secret service director Julia Pierson also confirmed recently disclosed details of a separate incident in 2011 during which seven bullets were fired by another man at the first floor of the residence, the noise of which was dismissed by secret service supervisors as a car back-firing until evidence of the shooting was discovered by cleaners several days later. The catalogue of blunders produced an angry response from congressmen in both parties who questioned the competence of Pierson, who was herself brought in to clean up the elite unit after earlier scandals in which drunken officers were found passed out during a presidential trip to Amsterdam and visiting prostitutes in Colombia. \u201cI have very low confidence in the secret service under your leadership,\u201d Massachusetts Democrat Stephen Lynch told Pierson. \u201cMy confidence in you protecting the president is very, very low right now. I don\u2019t think you are taking your job seriously.\u201d Congressmen were also angered by Pierson\u2019s bureaucratic tone and defensiveness, frequently interrupting to ask what would have happened if Gonzalez had been a more serious threat. \u201cI wish to God that you protect the White House like you protect your reputation today,\u201d added Lynch. \u201cThis is the US secret service versus one one individual with mental illness and you lost: you had three chances at this guy and he still got to the Green Room. What happens if you have a sophisticated adversary with nefarious intent? What happens then?\u201d Pierson conceded that she was responsible for the \u201cunacceptable\u201d fence-jumping incident, but insisted her officers had exercised \u201crestraint\u201d by not shooting him or releasing guard dogs designed to tackle intruders and could not have detained him in earlier encounters. \u201cWe all are outraged at how this situation came to pass ... it is obvious that mistakes were made,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take it lightly [but] there is not a lot we can do with mentally ill individuals who do not commit a crime. We are limited by the laws.\u201d She said there had been 16 White House fence jumpers over the last five years, including six this year alone and one the week before Gonzalez, but did not directly answer Washington DC delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who asked why there was not a higher fence. Virginia congressman Gerry Connolly briefly pushed back at Republican suggestions that secret service agents always ought to use lethal force in such situations, saying \u201cthe idea we have a shoot out on the White House lawn ought to be a last resort not a first resort\u201d. Nevertheless, the hearing raised fresh questions about the competency and culture of an agency tasked with protecting a president who receives three times as many death threats as any of his predecessors. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee, said he was particularly alarmed at suggestions that agents were reluctant to report security threats internally for fear of attracting criticism from their superiors. This followed news that one agent who heard the 2011 shooting and broke open an emergency weapons cache to defend the residence had not mentioned it the next day because supervisors were so insistent the noise was just a car back-firing. \u2022 This article was updated on 6 November 2014.

The work they purchase is written by \u201crelatively competent writers\u201d, but who have an \u201calmost universal ignorance of the scope of the work\u201d and an \u201cutter lack of in-depth analysis\u201d. This is completely true. I worked for two of these companies, both from home and \u201cin-house\u201d, which at one point saw 15 of us crammed into the boss\u2019s attic. Ofqual\u2019s researchers paid up to \u00a3220 for essays, but only a fraction of that money goes to the actual writer, who can earn as little as \u00a324 for every 1,000 words. To earn a reasonable rate, a writer needs to finish at least an essay a day. Writers quickly learn the first rule of paid essays: abandon all aspirations to quality, right now. Despite the fees, the companies contend that they don\u2019t produce \u201cessays\u201d to be handed in at all. Clients buy \u201cresearch guides\u201d to inspire their own work, in the same way that your Amsterdam souvenirs say \u201cFor Tobacco Use Only\u201d on them. But it covers the company: if you hand in your \u201c2:1 Guaranteed\u201d essay and it gets a 2:2, you have already breached your contract by submitting it. There is nothing you can do. That means for the writer, the game is to hit the word count as quickly as possible. As long as it looks like an essay, the actual words matter very little. Take every shortcut. Rephrase Wikipedia. Always give the counterpoint, no matter how weak: the words \u201con the other hand\u201d are your new best friend. If you don\u2019t have time to check citations, make them up! If the client can\u2019t be bothered to read a book, he\u2019s not going to check your page numbers. Quality-checking would vary. One company hired full-time quality staff, but it\u2019s hard to cover every subject area in every discipline, so \u201cquality checks\u201d were rarely more than proofreads. At another company, if you could write on one subject, this qualified you to write on anything. A law graduate would end up doing revision notes on Chinese political history, eventually writing a PhD proposal for an economics student and wondering how they got there. I once wrote a Market Research BA dissertation in two days and heard nothing more of it.

Hours after an unconvincing appearance before the House of Representatives government oversight committee, Julia Pierson tendered her resignation to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the elite agency. \u201cToday Julia Pierson, the director of the United States secret service, offered her resignation, and I accepted it. I salute her 30 years of distinguished service to the secret service and the nation,\u201d said the Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson. Johnson said he was appointing Joseph Clancy, who retired from the secret service in 2011, as interim acting director. \u201cI appreciate his willingness to leave his position in the private sector on very short notice and return to public service for a period,\u201d Johnson said. Clancy, who had worked at Comcast after his retirement, was previously the special agent in charge of the secret service\u2019s presidential protective division.  Johnson also ordered Alejandro Mayorkas, deputy secretary of Homeland Security, to assume control of the inquiry into the fence-jumping incident on 19 September that triggered the latest crisis. According to the White House, the investigation will also examine whether a broader review of the secret service is necessary. \u201cThe president concluded that new leadership of the agency was required,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a press briefing on Wednesday. \u201cIn the light of reports ... legitimate questions were raised.\u201d Earnest said Clancy had the confidence of President Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, who was reportedly angered by earlier security lapses at the White House, one of which took place while her daughter and mother were in the residence. The final straw appears to have come from a revelation that Obama was allowed to enter an elevator with an armed man during a trip to Atlanta on September 16 \u2013 something White House officials were not told about until minutes before press reports about the incident appeared on Tuesday. \u201cYou can assume that is part of the recent and accumulating reports to which I am referring,\u201d Earnest said when asked if this was the decisive factor in the president withdrawing his previous support for Pierson. Earnest confirmed that White House officials were not previously told of the security lapse, which involved a security contractor with a criminal record who reportedly behaved oddly, and said such a lapse in normal vetting procedures would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d if true. \u201cI think it\u2019s in the best interest of the Secret Service and the American public if I step down,\u201d Pierson said in an interview with Bloomberg News. \u201cCongress has lost confidence in my ability to run the agency. The media has made it clear that this is what they expected.\u201d Ironically, Pierson had been put in charge of the secret service only last year in response to a series of scandals, including the discovery of a drunken agent passed out in a hotel during a presidential trip to Amsterdam and agents allegedly visiting prostitutes on a visit to Colombia. Previously Pierson worked as chief of staff at the agency, overseeing new IT implementation, but also worked as a special agent herself. Pierson\u2019s fate is likely to have been sealed by misleading statements that the secret service issued after the fence-jumping incident, in which it was implied that the intruder was unarmed and made it no further than the front door, whereas in fact he allegedly carried a knife and ran some distance into the building. Republicans, led by Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, had been scathing of her handling of the incident, but anger was growing on both sides of aisle. New York Democrat Chuck Schumer was expected to become the first Democratic senator to call for her resignation in a press conference due later on Wednesday. Elijah Cummings, ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, said he backed the appointment of an independent panel to look at the secret service.  \u201cAs I told Ms Pierson in our phone call earlier today, we appreciate her 30 years of service to our nation, to the secret service, and to multiple presidents,\u201d he said in a statement issued after her resignation became public.  \u201cI absolutely respect her decision, and now we have to ensure that we focus on the difficult work of fully restoring the secret service to its rightful status as the most elite protective service in the world. I am pleased that Secretary Johnson has agreed with our suggestion to establish an independent panel of outside experts to begin to review these issues, which is a critical step.\u201d Cummings had previously come close to calling for Pierson to resign, saying there was little chance she could do enough to warrant staying. \u201cI want her to go if she cannot restore trust in the agency, and if she cannot get the culture back in order,\u201d Cummings had said during an interview on CNN. \u201cI told her that she\u2019s got a tall order there.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, Omar Gonzalez, the army veteran accused of breaking into the White House on 19 September, pleaded not guilty to three criminal charges relating to the incident. Lawyers for Gonzalez, who is said to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder after serving as a sniper in Iraq, are expected to defend the case on grounds of diminished responsibility. A grand jury indictment unsealed on Tuesday charges Gonzalez with three offences: entering a restricted building, carrying a deadly weapon, and possessing ammunition without registration. Prosecutors claim Gonzalez was found with a Spyderco vg10 knife on him as he was wrestled to the ground in the East Room of the White House after scaling the perimeter fence and breaching an estimated five layers of security protection. They also allege that a search of his nearby car after the incident yielded shotgun shells and bullets for seven different calibres of firearms.", "sentences": ["The media has made it clear that this is what they expected.\u201d Ironically, Pierson had been put in charge of the secret service only last year in response to a series of scandals, including the discovery of a drunken agent passed out in a hotel during a presidential trip to Amsterdam and agents allegedly visiting prostitutes on a visit to Colombia."], "title": "Secret service director Julie Pierson resigns after series of security lapses", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/secret-service-director-resigns-white-house-security-lapses", "tags": ["US news", "Obama administration", "US politics", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-10-03T11:50:31Z", "article": "If you read the marketing press at all, you will have heard of a new trend in \u201creal time advertising\u201d. If not, you\u2019ll be aware of sites asking you to opt into cookies, or being followed around the internet by shoes you almost bought a week ago. Gone are the days when advertisers had to buy large amounts of space in a magazine they hoped the target demographic would read. Now, individuals can be targeted, based on information harvested from your desktop and mobile phone. Ad space is bought and sold in real time, based on what data predicts you might do next. The most prevalent way of using this technology is retargeting, where advertisements appear for sites you have recently visited. However, data collecting and pattern spotting are now getting more sophisticated. Analytics agencies claim to be able to predict where you might go next and place ads for corresponding sites. If you have searched for flights to Amsterdam, you might start to see adverts for Amsterdam hotels, car hire and money changing services. Links to changing behaviour A recent campaign, designed to increase sales of Vodafone roaming packages in the Netherlands over the summer reportedly improved conversion rates by 198%. If buying behaviour can be changed in this way, could other behaviours? Could real time advertising be used to act as nudges towards more sustainable behaviour? Given the industry is advancing at such a rate, the question may not be \u201cwhat could we do with this technology?\u201d, but rather \u201cwhat should we do with it?\u201d Personal data collected in this way is already being used, with consent, in smoking cessation studies. Human behaviour is strongly influenced by situation. Data collected through mobile phones is used to pinpoint situations where the user is most likely to want to smoke and time the delivery of text messages or other nudges. UCL recently analysed the StopAdvisor website, which demonstrated a 36% higher quit rate among smokers with lower incomes who used the interactive site over a static information website. Dr Jamie Brown, research associate at UCL, who was heavily involved in the StopAdvisor study sums up the advantages of digitally placed nudges: \u201cPreviously, there would have been a disconnect between the messaging and the call to action. You may have seen a hard-hitting smoking campaign on television and thought about quitting, but not been able to get a doctor\u2019s appointment that week. Here you have the opportunity to connect the two.\u201d Personalisation: a mixed bag However, changing a health-based behaviour through a series of structured interventions in an environment where they\u2019ve opted in is very different to changing a more abstract one in the advertising space. While there is much hype surrounding real time advertising, not everyone is convinced the technology is advanced enough to be truly effective. One issue is the ability for the ads to be truly personalised. We know that the more personalised something is, the more likely we are to react well to it (think of the success of Coca-Cola\u2019s named cans), yet, if something is not personalised enough, it can actually cause negative reactants. Dr Felix Naughton, senior research associate at the University of Cambridge, explains how we find crudely personalised spam insulting. Those of us sharing devices who have received untimely clues to our partner\u2019s Christmas present searches, or been chased around Facebook by weight loss products merely because we are in our 30s and female will know this well. Both academics and agency people are sceptical that changing complex or habitual behaviours could be achieved through real time advertising alone, but seemed to think it could be used as a part of a framework of interventions. However, it seems that the technology is not currently being used by behaviour change agencies and according to Oliver Payne, founder of behaviour change agency, The Hunting Dynasty, the need for better targeting is not the reason. He talks of an agency knowledge gap around behaviour change and calls for more psychologists and anthropologists to be recruited into communications. He also warns of the mistake of overvaluing \u201ccreativity\u201d when designing strategies for behavioural change; starting with the sometimes repetitive or unglamorous methods that are proven to work is often better. Indeed, much of the current conversation around real time advertising is about the way it is bought and sold (\u201cprogrammatically\u201d, much like the stock market) and not about how it can be effectively integrated into the creative process. Of course, all of this use of data to manipulate behaviour strays dangerously into debateable ethical territory. As recent scandals involving Facebook and OKCupid have shown, people don\u2019t take kindly to being manipulated without their consent. Jez Groom, group chief strategy officer of Ogilvy &amp; Mather and co-founder of #ogilvychange identifies some of the ethical issues with combining personal data with psychology to nudge them to make certain choices: \u201cYou\u2019re looking at personal, subconscious signals and you\u2019re using this to direct people to things that are not necessarily in their best interests in the long term... I think we\u2019re quite close to the line of acceptability already, and that\u2019s a narrative I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d However, others, such as Todd Tran, Nexage\u2019s Europe managing director, believe the evidence suggests we are happy for advertisers to send us relevant advertisements and currently have limited privacy fears with respect to it. He believes we are seeing an emerging conversation where consumers will be \u201cbuilding, providing and selling their profiles to take control of the process and increase the percentage of relevant ads\u201d. This, in itself could represent a behaviour change opportunity. Could users start to opt into advertising that nudges them towards a sustainable lifestyle? Real time advertising could have a future as a behaviour change tool as part of a wider strategy, but it still needs to overcome current technological barriers and an agency skills gap before it will do. In the interim, it will continue be used to make it easier for us to buy ever more things.

You reach for your smartphone to switch it off. What do you do next? For many entrepreneurs, next will be checking their email inbox \u2013 a knee-jerk reaction fostered by a need to be constantly available and not miss out on business. Kathryn Parsons, co-founder of Decoded, which offers digital training including coding courses, recently ditched email in an effort to save time. \u201cThere\u2019s not a founder out there who doesn\u2019t just wake up and work until you literally collapse. Technology is a big part of that,\u201d she says. \u201cEmail\u2019s not very good for focus at all. It\u2019s like a letterbox where anyone can put anything.\u201d Has email become outdated? Formal openings and long message chains are at odds with the directness and efficiency of social media. More worryingly, there\u2019s a proven effect on productivity. Dr Tom Jackson, professor of information and knowledge management at Loughborough University, has carried out extensive research on the topic. In a study in 2011, he found that it takes 70% of people six seconds to respond to an email. With most email applications set to check for new mail every five minutes, that can add up to 96 interruptions in an eight-hour day. \u201cEach email you receive adds another task and at the end of the day you\u2019re very fatigued. We see the creativity and productivity of staff depleted by the end of the day,\u201d says Jackson. In a 2012 study on the physiological and psychological impact of email on employees, Jackson tracked 28 office workers over three months. The blood pressure and cortisol levels (a hormone that regulates stress levels) of each participant were measured on normal working days and email-free days, and each kept a diary. Cortisol is released when you\u2019re under stress as it helps to keep energy and blood sugar levels on an even keel. Jackson explains that our cortisol levels start at their highest in the morning and deplete throughout the day. On email-free days, participants\u2019 cortisol levels were less depleted by the evening. Parsons notes a current trend of using technology to \u201ccreate a sense of control and focus\u201d. Instant messaging systems have replaced emails as internal communications for some \u2013 at Decoded the staff use Slack to keep in touch while out of the office and to share ideas within the team. Parsons\u2019 team can be found scattered across the world at any one time. At the time of speaking, she had staff in LA, Hong Kong, Sydney, Amsterdam, New York and London. She says: \u201cWe feel really connected even though we\u2019re all over the globe and doing different things in different times zones.\u201d Entrepreneurs look for different ways to manage their inbox. Parsons mentions one business founder who doesn\u2019t look at any emails that come in on that day, instead dealing with them the following day. Content creation company Stipso uses instant messaging too. Steven Drost, the CEO, explains that they have also used Slack since starting up in January 2013. \u201cThere are many different tools that we use. We were looking for something to make internal communications easy,\u201d he says. For Drost, it was important to have something that could link up the tools the business uses, as well as being able to organise different tasks. \u201cIt becomes a dashboard of what\u2019s going on across different projects. You can create channels, for example one about a product, one about a market, so you\u2019ll see the Twitter notifications when anyone mentions you or gets in contact.\u201d Relying on instant messaging for internal communications has helped reduce daily stress for Drost. He used to wake up to around 100 emails every day. \u201cNow it\u2019s about 60% less that that,\u201d he says. While both advocates of instant messaging, Drost and Parsons admit email is useful for more formal communications, such as sharing contracts. Jackson trains businesses to use email more efficiency, rather than scrapping it altogether. His first tip is to check emails no more than once every 40 minutes. Some forethought before writing also cuts down on confusion. \u201cEmails should be a maximum of two short paragraphs, the subject line should give an indication to what an email is about and what the action requirements are. And you should only copy in the vital people,\u201d advises Jackson. Some may argue that instant messaging is equally as distracting as email. However, it is possible to limit disruption. Drost says he will switch it off completely when he needs to focus. It can also encourage collaboration, as ideas emerge throughout the day, and it keeps everyone within the loop. \u201cYou spend a lot of time within the system talking to each other and you can see what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Droust. Slack \u2013 like other complex messaging systems with project management capabilities, such as Podio or Flock \u2013 is useful for technology companies. Another benefit of instant messaging is that it can help to cut down on internal email chains when day-to-day questions arise. Some businesses, however, still rely on email. MVF is a customer acquisition company that helps businesses grow their customer base through digital marketing and sales. Email is an important method of communication for Titus Sharpe, the CEO. \u201cAs we have customers in over 55 countries around the world email is used more than telephone to address the time difference,\u201d he says. Sharpe believes it is still a vital tool in the office. \u201cIt means that in a fast-paced environment, everything we work on is well documented and can be revisited easily,\u201d he says. It appears that email still has its place but finding ways to reduce volume, such as instant messaging for internal communications, can make businesses more productive and reduce stress. As Parsons put it: \u201cUltimately technology is useless unless it\u2019s useful to you.\u201d Paul Lancaster, a content and social media specialist, is the founder of the No Email Day campaign, which has been held on a different day each year since 2011 - so far they\u2019ve been on the 11/11/11, 12/12/12, 3/3/13 and 4/4/14. The day encourages people to stop using email completely for 24 hours and spend their time more productively.  Lancaster explains what prompted his nine page manifesto on the topic. \u201cI was frustrated by what an inefficient method of communication email had become. This coincided with an increase in social media communication, mainly Twitter.\u201d What is Lancaster\u2019s view on the future of emails in business? \u201cI think we\u2019re at a crossroads where many of us are trying to do too much,\u201d he adds. \u201cSince the first No Email Day, I\u2019ve noticed an increase in people talking and blogging about ditching email. Less email can help reduce stress and increase happiness.\u201d  Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.", "sentences": ["At the time of speaking, she had staff in LA, Hong Kong, Sydney, Amsterdam, New York and London."], "title": "Have emails had their day in the modern office?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/oct/03/have-emails-had-day-modern-office-business", "tags": ["Smarter working", "Guardian Small Business Network", "Business", "Small business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-10-04T15:54:57Z", "article": "Young music fans more used to listening to pop are instead tuning into Henry Purcell, as classical music gains a foothold in Britain&apos;s youth culture. One of the UK&apos;s leading underground music channels, Boiler Room, is starting a series of classical shows, beginning this week in Manchester with a collaboration with the London Contemporary Orchestra. Also, the BBC announced an initiative last week, aimed at primary schools in the UK, that hopes to inspire a generation of children about the joys of classical music. Boiler Room started in 2010 in the decaying utility room of a pigeon-infested warehouse in east London when underground DJs and live acts were invited to perform for a small crowd and an online audience via a webcam taped to the wall. Back then, nobody imagined the music channel would one day be teaming up with a full orchestra and Jonny Greenwood, the guitarist in Radiohead, to host a series of classical music events in concert halls across the country. &quot;For many young people, classical music has always been class-related and hard to access, in the same way that everyone goes to the cinema, but not many go to the theatre,&quot; said Radio 1 &amp; 1Xtra DJ and tastemaker Benji B (real name Benjamin Benstead), who is introducing his listeners to the likes of Claude Debussy, John Cage and Steve Reich. &quot;Classical music is seen as impenetrable and there&apos;s a snobbery related to it but at last that&apos;s changing and it seems to be incredibly popular.&quot; The Boiler Room classical series will feature performances of work by Iannis Xenakis, Purcell and Olivier Messiaen. In 2011, Benstead invited the Deviation String Quartet to join him in one of the London Eye&apos;s pods for an improvised performance as part of Red Bull&apos;s Revolutions in Sound event and, since then, he has been working with a string orchestra to make classical arrangements of modern songs. Blaise Bellville, founder and CEO of Boiler Room, says there has been an overwhelmingly positive reaction from the under-25 crowd as young people become increasingly open to classical music. &quot;Young audiences are more open than ever to different ideas and genres. For instance, young people are excited by Henrik Schwarz&apos;s decision to premiere his new jazz and contemporary classical project with us in a concert hall at Amsterdam Dance Event this month, instead of wanting him to lay down just another sweaty techno set.&quot; Bellville thinks one explanation for this enthusiasm is that a trait among music fans is to have a &quot;digger&apos;s instinct&quot; to explore and experience different sounds. &quot;If it helps to have someone of Jonny Greenwood&apos;s stature to nudge you in the direction of chamber music or Boiler Room to lead you towards abstract classical forms, then we&apos;re doing our job properly,&quot; he said. Gabriel Szatan, curator at Boiler Room, agreed, adding that some electronic figureheads such as Four Tet, James Holden, Nils Frahm and Kompakt Records have also helped pave the way for this change. &quot;Recently, we&apos;ve seen breakout stars like Jon Hopkins and James Blake come from classically trained backgrounds and one of the all-time most played records in Boiler Room DJ sets is a remix of minimalist classical composer Steve Reich. This generation is incredibly eager and open-minded and it&apos;s no surprise that people are into this.&quot; According to Robert Ames, artistic director at the LCO, there is a hunger for collaborative music events and a lot of work goes into making performances special. &quot;People are looking for new experiences and quality music making allows them to access something different. The growth of our young audience has been really stimulated by people understanding that there is a soundworld out there which is incredibly dynamic and exciting. We&apos;re offering something that they don&apos;t get to hear through the standard music channels.&quot; Ames also thinks that collaborating with well-known artists, musicians and brands such as Conrad Shawcross, William Basinski, Ron Arad, Foals, Vivienne Westwood and Nike helps the LCO bring in a new, younger audience. For Derrick May, the Detroit techno pioneer, who recently performed his music with the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra, combining classical and electronic music has been a long time coming. &quot;It had always been a dream of mine, but it only began to take shape a few years ago,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s amazing to hear my music as I accompany them playing improvisational keyboards. I&apos;m stood there, in between the orchestra, and I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s really happening. It&apos;s surreal but really cool at the same time.&quot; However, May, who is a fan of Rachmaninov and Beethoven, admits that the experience can be daunting. &quot;I&apos;m playing with professionals so I have to play really well. I can feel their eyes on me and I guess they&apos;re wondering what the hell I&apos;m doing among them. The pressure is on and I enjoy that feeling.&quot; With collaborations such as these winning over a new generation of classical fans and gaining millions of hits online, many think the trend is here to stay. &quot;We have some ambitious projects in the pipeline and we want to explore the classical world in even more depth,&quot; said Bellville. &quot;And as long as that appetite exists, we&apos;ll be there.&quot; \u2022 Jonny Greenwood &amp; London Contemporary Orchestra at Albert Hall in Manchester, 10 October", "sentences": ["For instance, young people are excited by Henrik Schwarz&apos;s decision to premiere his new jazz and contemporary classical project with us in a concert hall at Amsterdam Dance Event this month, instead of wanting him to lay down just another sweaty techno set.&quot; Bellville thinks one explanation for this enthusiasm is that a trait among music fans is to have a &quot;digger&apos;s instinct&quot; to explore and experience different sounds."], "title": "Classical music breaks out and joins the youth underground", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/04/classical-music-joins-youth-underground", "tags": ["Classical music", "Radiohead", "Music", "Culture", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-10-05T07:00:10Z", "article": "Back in November 2008 when the Observer conducted its last survey on drug use in Britain, the country and the world around had just entered a new phase that no one quite understood. Lehman Brothers had recently collapsed and suddenly the c-word that was the second-most associated with the City was crash, not cocaine. Yet not even those in the grip of a truly paranoia-inducing marijuana high could fully conceive of the years of depression and austerity that were to follow.  So in 2014, with all the economic and geopolitical problems that beset us, it might seem trivial or somehow decadent to look too closely at drug consumption and attitudes. But that would be an erroneous conclusion for two reasons. First, if we\u2019re to use death as a metric for significance, in recent years 10,000 violent deaths a year can be attributed to the drugs trade in Mexico alone. Second, it\u2019s also a matter of life. For, like it or not, illicit and/or recreational drugs are part of how we live now. That doesn\u2019t mean that everyone takes them, although almost a third of us \u2013 about 15 million \u2013 have done so (31%, up from 27% six years ago). But it does mean that everyone is affected by them. Given the percentages, it follows that everyone knows someone who has taken drugs. And the chances are that most of us know someone who acknowledges that they\u2019ve had problems with drugs. In addition, it\u2019s not unlikely that we\u2019ve fallen victim to a crime committed by an addict funding his or her habit. The point is that drugs cannot be safely categorised as a niche activity or a passing fad. They are as much part of modern life as food banks or farmers\u2019 markets. They span all social classes and, although disproportionately concentrated among the under-35s, all ages.

Photograph: Pool/Elaine Thompson/AP    That said, most drug taking is conducted over a relatively short period of time. It\u2019s rare you find life-long drug users in the way, for instance, that you find life-long drinkers and smokers. The profile of an average drug user is someone who starts at 19, and the average stopping age is 26. For most of these twentysomething slackers, their drug experimentation will be limited to smoking marijuana. And the majority of it is conducted in the home. However, that\u2019s only part of the story. The exceptions to the rule are so varied and widespread they can hardly be described as exceptional. The use of drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy remains high: each has been tried by around a third of drug users. Now a new generation of drugs is increasingly available, especially in London. The so-called \u201clegal highs\u201d, or, as one expert called them, \u201cnovel psychoactive substances\u201d, haven\u2019t made a big impression on the survey yet, but all indications are that we will see more synthetic drugs, which seek to mimic the effects of established drugs while circumventing the law. And there are signs that these drugs suffer little of the stigma that dog, say, crack cocaine and heroin. According to Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, a consultant psychiatrist working in the drug field, many who experience problems with club drugs are reluctant to consult conventional drug clinics because they associate them with crack and heroin addicts. Of current drug-users, 40% come from social grades AB \u2013 ie the wealthiest bands. In this respect the most revealing drug story of the last year was that of the Rev Paul Flowers, the 64-year-old Methodist minister, former Labour councillor and one-time chairman of the Co-operative Bank. It would be hard to invent someone with a more established position in society than a man who is prominent in the church, politics and banking. And, to be sure, it didn\u2019t look good when the so-called Crystal Methodist was exposed as a regular user of cocaine, methamphetamine and ketamine. Especially considering that the bank discovered a \u00a31.5bn hole in its finances during Flowers\u2019s chairmanship.     Paul Flowers, who was chairman of Co-operative Bank. Photograph: Photograph: Lynne Cameron/PA    Not even the most gung-ho advocate of drugs would dare argue that a cocktail of cocaine and methamphetamine would be likely to sharpen one\u2019s grasp of complex financial transactions and investments. But, leaving aside whether or not the drugs affected Flowers\u2019s professional judgment, the striking detail was that it wasn\u2019t that shocking that he was found to have extensive experience of class A and B drugs. Newsworthy, yes, but not beyond contemplation. Similarly, the reluctant admission last year by Toronto mayor Rob Ford that he had smoked crack cocaine also laid dramatic claim to the headlines. But again, it was a media splash, not a moral earthquake. Both men claimed they acted under pressure, which may be true, but it\u2019s also part of the narrative of redemption and recovery. Drug use in this way is a symptom of deeper social and psychological problems. Again, that is often the case. But not always. Drug use is sometimes about not a great deal more than using drugs. Whatever their causes and motivations, these two tales confirmed that drug use or abuse is not the preserve of the young or the powerless. By their own estimation, most people \u201cuse\u201d rather than \u201cabuse\u201d drugs. The survey shows, in a representative analysis of everyone who has taken drugs, that only 13% thought that they had ever had a drug problem. In terms of actual numbers, that amounts to a sizeable figure \u2013 somewhere around 2 million Britons consider that at some point in their lives they have had a dysfunctional relationship with drugs. And about half of them still do. What constitutes a problem will, of course, vary from individual to individual, perhaps from outright dependency down to minor health concerns. The government determines what is problematic in terms of economic impact. Home Office research suggests that between a third and a half of all acquisitive crime is committed by offenders who use heroin, cocaine or crack cocaine. The last time the cost of that crime was added up was 10 years ago and the figure the government arrived at was \u00a313.9bn. The total economic and social cost was estimated to be a staggering \u00a315.4bn. Although there are no exact figures, over the last 15 to 20 years drug-associated crime has been decreasing, and there have been many theories put forward to explain the drop. For those who argue that the correct means of dealing with illegal drugs is the criminal justice system, then the decline in class A drug-related crime indicates that prohibition and prison work. As journalist Ross Clark put it, writing in the Times earlier this year: \u201cWe can only guess how many would have experimented with heroin and crack had they been legal: 1%? 10%? But to judge by the upwards jolt in crime that accompanied an epidemic [of heroin and crack in the 1990s] involving 0.5% of the population, Britain would have been a bloodbath.\u201d Elsewhere \u2013 particularly in America, where a similar drop has occurred \u2013 it\u2019s been powerfully argued that the decrease in heroin and crack use has less to do with prison than with a community reaction against the devastation these drugs can wreak. Advocates of decriminalisation, such as film-maker Eugene Jarecki, maintain that it\u2019s health departments, not crime departments, that should be dealing with drug problems. The so-called \u201cwar on drugs\u201d has cost America $1trn since 1971 and has resulted in 45 million arrests, and a 12-fold increase in the number of offenders imprisoned on drug charges. It\u2019s a much more draconian response to a much larger problem than exists in Britain (where the prison population doubled between 1993 and 2012). As a consequence, the drugs debate is more urgent in America. One aspect of this is that the general drama of drugs plays a more pronounced role in American culture. It\u2019s no coincidence that two of the most impressive American TV series of recent years have focused on crack cocaine (The Wire) and crystal methamphetamine (Breaking Bad). In both cases it\u2019s worthy of note that the previously irredeemable archetype of the street dealer emerges (several in The Wire, Jesse in Breaking Bad) as a sympathetic figure.     Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul playing drug producers Walter White and Jesse Pinkman in the TV series Breaking Bad Photograph: Photograph: Frank Ockenfels/AMC    Another, more concrete, development is that, in the non-fiction world, two US states, Washington and Colorado, have decriminalised marijuana. Our survey shows that Britons are divided over the idea of instituting a similar scheme in this country, with just over half supporting it. But the divisions remain wide: 27% of the population thought our drug laws are too liberal, and exactly the same number thought that they\u2019re not liberal enough \u2013 whereas 46% think they\u2019re just right. The underlying trend is towards greater liberalisation (only 18% felt the laws needed to be more liberal in 2008), but as things stand there\u2019s a balance, with more younger people wanting reform and more older people wanting stricter controls, and the half in the middle content with what we\u2019ve got. Our survey shows 33% of those aged between 16 and 24 said drug laws were not liberal enough, and 40% of those aged 65 and over said drug laws were too liberal. To some extent, drug policy in this country seeks to cater to all those groups \u2013 on the one hand talking tough; on the other often turning a blind eye, and the main body of policing targeting \u201cproblem\u201d drug users. It\u2019s not a picture that suggests radical change is afoot. Yet it\u2019s striking that as many as 84% of Britons don\u2019t believe that the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d can ever be won. If that\u2019s the case, you might think, then why is there not more support for policies that reject this failed strategy? The answer is probably that \u201cwar\u201d is a misleading metaphor for combating drugs. As cultural critic and former prison doctor Theodore Dalrymple has put it: \u201cSaying the war against drugs is unwinnable is like saying the war against burglary is unwinnable and we should open our doors. Absurd. War is the wrong word.\u201d As with so many other areas of life, the UK has one foot in America and one in Europe. We want both approaches \u2013 the harsh and the lenient \u2013 simultaneously. It\u2019s made for a strategy that is neither clear nor long-term, but appears to accept the idea that there is not a great deal else to be done. Certainly there seems little political appetite for the sort of measures brought in by Portugal in 2001. Partly as a response to the country\u2019s high rate of HIV among intravenous drug users, the authorities decriminalised drug possession, as long as the user had no more than 10 days\u2019 supply. The results have been mixed, with some reduction in HIV and crime, but also increases in some hard drug use. Ultimately, until the major drug-consuming nation (the US) and the major drug distributing and producing countries (Colombia, Mexico, Afghanistan) undergo a major decriminalisation process, then violence and illegality will continue to underpin the drug trade. In other words, no matter what happens in Amsterdam or Lisbon, it\u2019s not going to affect the terrifying number of killings associated with the drug business in Latin America. Which brings us back to where we started. This survey, when matched against previous surveys, appears to suggest that we are moving as a society towards greater tolerance and understanding of drug use. But it\u2019s a gradual shift and there is no guarantee as to where it will end. As things stand, the pleasure derived from drugs cannot easily be divorced from the misery they inflict on more than one in 10 users, nor from the savage violence that continues to characterise their production and distribution. One man\u2019s high currently seems to necessitate another\u2019s low. It would be nice to think that before the next Observer survey on drugs, there will be a coordinated international effort to look at a more rational, healthier and less murderous means of organising the drugs trade.

Unloved in the 17th century, but revered today, the painting is now set to travel to the UK for first time, 352 years after it was rejected by the civic leaders of Amsterdam. The Conspiracy of the Batavians under Claudius Civilis is a remarkable painting that usually hangs \u2013 and rarely leaves \u2013 Sweden\u2019s national museum in Stockholm. It seems to revel in barbarism, with its deformed and grotesque characters. Drastically cut down by Rembrandt, Simon Schama once said of it: \u201cThis may just be the most heartbreaking fragment in the entire history of painting.\u201d  The closure of the Swedish museum for redevelopment has allowed for a one-off opportunity. It currently hangs on loan in Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum and will, it has just been announced, travel to London in October for the National Gallery\u2019s major exhibition exploring the late works of Rembrandt. Betsy Wieseman, curator of Dutch and Flemish paintings at the National Gallery, said the painting\u2019s \u201craw and almost brutal\u201d figures would have worked perfectly in its intended home \u2013 several metres off the ground in Amsterdam\u2019s misleadingly titled Town Hall, the city\u2019s grandest building, which later became the royal palace. The painting hung there briefly until the city\u2019s civic leaders returned it, unwanted, to Rembrandt, who cut it down by nearly three-quarters, from just over 30 sq metres to 3 metres wide and 1.96 metres high. There are different theories as to what happened in Amsterdam. Certainly there was good reason to take against it: there were not enough people in it for contemporary taste and it would have been far more naturalistic than the city leaders were expecting, with the one-eyed Dutch hero Claudius Civilis quite shocking \u2013 shown full-frontally rather than the usual profile. Another reason may have been less aesthetic. Jonathan Bikker, the Rijksmuseum\u2019s curator of research, said one theory was that Rembrandt, who declared himself bankrupt in 1656, had been asked to make changes, for which he was going to charge. \u201cThe mayors simply said: \u2018No way, forget about it, 1,200 guilders is enough!\u2019\u201d Whatever the reasons, it was returned to the artist and replaced by a far inferior work by Govert Flinck, which they already had in their collection and was fairly cheap to get retouched. The securing of Claudius Civilis is a real coup but only one of many impressive loans for the National Gallery exhibition. These include The Jewish Bride and The Syndics from the Rijksmuseum, which will also host the Rembrandt show next year. The Mauritshuis in The Hague is sending two of its Rembrandt jewels including Portrait of an Elderly Man (1667) and the artist\u2019s final self-portrait from 1669. It will not, though, be sending two remarkable paintings \u2013 one of Homer and another of Two Moors. The gallery\u2019s head of collections, Edwin Buijsen, admitted a degree of relief. \u201cThese two paintings were also requested but we cannot lend them because they were gifted to the museum by a former director and his will stated they should never leave the Mauritshuis ... we can never lend them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe National Gallery tried but it is legally not possible.\u201d The Rembrandt show will be the first in-depth exploration of Rembrandt\u2019s late works, a time when his creativity and ambition to break conventions burned brighter than ever. Wieseman said it was hard to keep up with what might have been going on in his mind. \u201cHis late works are his thorniest,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many questions because there is such a variation in technique. He is not doing a linear progression, he is bouncing back and forth \u2013 attacking one thing and then discarding it, taking it up again 10 years later. It is really difficult to figure out.\u201d The idea of a major late Rembrandt show has been around for 20 years, since a big exhibition at the National Gallery when curators talked about the relative lack of in-depth study into his late works. One reason it has taken so long is that the Rijksmuseum has been being redeveloped for 10 years. There will be about 90 works \u2013 40 paintings, 30 prints and 20 drawings \u2013 and visitors may well find him exasperatingly idiosyncratic. \u201cSome days I love Rembrandt; some days I want to kick his ass,\u201d said Wieseman. \u201cIt is challenging to get inside his head and figure out what he was trying to do ... but very rewarding.\u201d \u2022 Rembrandt: The Late Works is at the National Gallery, London, from 15\u00a0October to 18 January 2015", "sentences": ["Unloved in the 17th century, but revered today, the painting is now set to travel to the UK for first time, 352 years after it was rejected by the civic leaders of Amsterdam.", "It currently hangs on loan in Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum and will, it has just been announced, travel to London in October for the National Gallery\u2019s major exhibition exploring the late works of Rembrandt.", "Betsy Wieseman, curator of Dutch and Flemish paintings at the National Gallery, said the painting\u2019s \u201craw and almost brutal\u201d figures would have worked perfectly in its intended home \u2013 several metres off the ground in Amsterdam\u2019s misleadingly titled Town Hall, the city\u2019s grandest building, which later became the royal palace.", "There are different theories as to what happened in Amsterdam."], "title": "Rembrandt late gem to be shown in UK first time", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/05/rembrandt-late-gem-shown-uk-first-time", "tags": ["Rembrandt", "Art and design", "Art", "Culture", "National Gallery", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-10-06T11:04:33Z", "article": "It is London Cocktail Week (6-12 October). In the capital, bearded mixologists are creating mad-hatter libations with liquid smoke, ambergris and the petals of a flower that blooms but one day a year. If that sounds a bit much, take refuge in a simple gin and tonic. We know where we are with mother\u2019s ruin. Or do we? While Brits like to think of the G&amp;T as our own (and it was indeed first made by the British East India Company in the early 1800s), in recent years it has become hugely popular across Europe and beyond, with takes on the classic drink that would have the Queen Mother turning in her grave. \u201cWe are in the throes of a global gin craze,\u201d says Felix von Hurter, the international sales manager for Sipsmith gin. \u201cThere have been more than 100 gins launched this year, including Russian, Swedish and South African ones.\u201d According to Von Hurter, this is because of a trend for gin-based cocktails, which has trickled down from expensive cocktail joints to regular bars and pubs. \u201cAt each step, the gin and tonic swiftly becomes the cocktail of the masses,\u201d he says. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Spain. If you\u2019ve been to the Iberian peninsula in the past five years, you\u2019ve probably been handed a \u201cgin-tonic\u201d in a glass the size of your head. \u201cSpain is gin paradise, and the biggest market for gin in the world per head of population,\u201d says Geraldine Coates, the editor of Gintime.com. The most marked difference between a Spanish G&amp;T and a British one is the glass \u2013 in Spain\u2019s case a large, balloon-shaped stemmed glass, the copa de balon. This craze started in northern Spain\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurants, says Jorge Balbontin, the global brand ambassador for Gin Mare.     Spanish practices: Iberians like their gin and tonics in balon glasses. Photograph: Albert Mollon/Getty Images/Flickr RF    \u201cSeven to eight years ago, the chefs at El Bulli and Arzak started drinking gin and tonic in a bordeaux wine glass,\u201d he says \u2013 to keep their drinks cool in a hot kitchen. \u201cIf you were in one of those restaurants, at the end of your dinner the chef would come out with a big gin and tonic. People were writing about this, and the gin brands saw an opportunity.\u201d The Spanish have taken gin-tonics to their hearts: \u201cEven in the smallest bar in the smallest city, they\u2019ll have anywhere between 30-60 bottles of gin and 10-15 different tonics,\u201d says Balbontin. But the Spanish aren\u2019t the only ones. Worldwide, the biggest gin markets are the US (by volume), Spain (per head), the UK, India and the Philippines. The latter nation consumes huge volumes of \u201cjuniper-based spirits that technically qualify as gin\u201d, explains Olivier Ward of Ginfoundry.com, even though they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be recognisable as such to a western palate. Other nations are catching up fast. Gin and tonic is becoming popular in the Netherlands, Germany, Greece and Italy, among others, and is making inroads into Latin America and Australia. Forget a splash of Schweppes and a twist of lemon, here\u2019s how they\u2019re serving G&amp;Ts around the world \u2026 Spain The Spanish may be drinking their gin-tonics in big glasses, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re falling down drunk in the calle. The typical serve is 50ml gin to 100-200ml tonic, and plenty of ice. It comes with \u201canything from cinnamon sticks to rosemary to grapes\u201d, says Von Hurter, although he says the Spanish are getting bored with \u201cfruit salad floating in their drinks\u201d. The copa de balon trend has spread to Portugal, the Netherlands and Belgium. \u201cWe sell almost as much gin in Antwerp and Amsterdam as we do in Madrid,\u201d says Von Hurter. Germany In Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt, drinkers are swapping beer for the basil smash, a popular gin cocktail usually drunk from a rocks or tall glass. It was invented by J\u00f6rg Meyer from the Lion in Hamburg, who muddled basil leaves and lemon together and served them with a simple syrup and gin. \u201cBasil is a big gin trend in Germany,\u201d says Balbontin, adding that it is proving popular in G&amp;Ts at hip Berlin bars including Raval, which is owned by Hollywood actor Daniel Br\u00fchl.      Italians use their gin to make a negroni, which mixes the spirit with vermouth rosso and campari. Photograph: Brian Leatart/Getty Images    Italy, Colombia and Mexico The Italians have long been fond of gin in a negroni. Similar bitter notes can now be found in a popular G&amp;T, the triple orange, made with bitter marmalade, orange bitters and fresh orange. Balbontin says he has seen the drink in at least five Italian cities, including Rome, Turin and Milan. It is becoming popular in Colombia and Mexico too, appearing on the drinks list at Mexico City drinking dens such as Artemisia and Puebla 109. Greece Hannah Grace Lodge of Barchick.com says: \u201cAthens\u2019 best bar \u2013 the Gin Joint \u2013 has more than 90 bottles behind the bar and focuses on serving signature G&amp;Ts with interesting garnishes and glassware.\u201d. Balbontin says the gin trend only started in the past year or two in Greece, but is popular in Athens and on party islands such as Mykonos. One of the more outlandish serves involves setting dried thyme on fire, filling a gin glass with the smoke, then serving a G&amp;T in it. The US Craft gin is big news in the States, though it often makes its way into martinis and cocktails rather than a classic G&amp;T.

The smart slum is still a peripheral idea, but we can speculate on the likely impact of extending this \u2018smartness\u2019 to slums and make two competing claims. Firstly, that development professionals should be wary of smart slums repeating some of the negative impacts of ICT4D; and secondly, that a push for smart slums could be appropriated for social justice. The idea of the smart city is a vision of a networked urbanism. The promise is that environmental monitoring and feedback from embedded sensors everywhere will simultaneously deliver greener and more productive cities. The idea has been most fully materialised in brand new cities like Songdo in South Korea but is spreading to established urban centres like San Francisco, Amsterdam and Madrid. The smart city itself is by no means a new idea. In previous decades it had labels like cybernetic or connected city, but it has been given a new lease of life by the flowering of small, cheap and adaptable sensors that draw on smartphone technologies and DIY electronics (think Arduino and the Internet of Things). For people working in development this comes with an attractive new feature; the smart city of today is seen as participatory. Feedback and monitoring includes the active participation of citizens who install smart metrics and sensors (such as the Arduino-based Smart Citizen Kit, which measures temperature, humidity, noise, CO2 and NO2 levels), contribute data, and become part of a kind of sensor citizenship. The smart slum also makes sense as a way to bridge the infrastructure gap; by adding programmable intelligence to services that are extended in to slums (such as sensors that report the water flow in pipes and send alerts if water use is outside of the expected normal range), they can be managed in a way that is responsive and well-adapted to the ever-shifting environments of informal settlements.  The idea of smart slums shares a great deal with the way slum mapping has adopted new technologies and participatory processes. A decade or so ago, a coalition of NGOs and women\u2019s networks mapped hundreds of Pune\u2019s slum settlements, with the aim of bringing poor communities into the official mechanisms of city planning, so that they would get a better share of resources. More recently, the Map Kibera project has used the participatory technologies of GPS and OpenStreetMap to enable residents of Kenya\u2019s biggest slum to make a digital map of their streets and alleyways. Map Kibera is meant as a platform for empowerment; giving residents a way to monitor and report on their own experiences of government initiatives.  But smart slums could still repeat the problematic cycle of first generation ICT4D if the technologies are dropped into communities without an effort to build the capacity of poorer citizens to use them. Many funding evaluation reports and academic studies show how ineffective the tech-led approach can be, and how it can reinforce existing divides. Moreover, the whole idea of monitoring, like mapping, should be approached with caution. Mapping and measurement were the original mechanisms of colonial control and projects that simply add visibility without agency risk reinforcing the status quo. It may also be that sensors and smartness paradoxically limit citizenship rather than extending it, if citizens just participate by generating data and real resource decisions are made elsewhere. This is a dystopian version of smart slums as a way to subdue and control.  So how could smart slums be done differently? One approach is being tested through bottom-up citizen science. The approach of these projects (like our own Kosovo Science for Change) draws on critical pedagogies like that of 1960s educator Paulo Freire, for whom learning was the co-operative activity of understanding how our lived experience is constructed, and how to make a difference in the world. These projects involve citizens in using embedded sensor technology to answer their own questions about their environments. The approach would be familiar to development professionals as participatory community development but with added elements of maker culture \u2013 fablabs and hackerspaces \u2013 and empirical methods.  If applied in the context of smart slums, these methods could be partof a new politics of infrastructure. As every part of traffic, water,energy and waste systems become direct generators of data they raise new questions of governance. Now that we can see what\u2019s going on and have the computational ability to influence it, who gets to decide how it\u2019smanaged? The answer doesn\u2019t just depend on companies and government but on the potential for citizens to prototype their own solutions.

The Italian conductor Daniele Gatti is its new leader; and he\u2019s familiar to audiences in this country after a 13-year stint in charge of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and has a close association with Covent Garden. Gatti will take up the position from 2016, after Mariss Jansons steps down in 2015, having led the Concertgebouw since 2004.  The question is what Gatti\u2019s appointment means for him and the orchestra. The Concertgebouw is arguably in even better shape than it was when Jansons took over, having established its own successful in-house CD label, and with its international profile cemented with tours all over the world. The orchestra\u2019s luminous ensemble sounds as compelling as ever whether they\u2019re playing at home in the sumptuous yet complex acoustic of the Concertgebouw itself, or at the Barbican, in London, where they are frequent visitors.  The Concertgebouw has ridden out the tumultuous recent times for Dutch orchestras and classical music in general; the orchestra\u2019s recently released 2013 annual report warns that unless the orchestra receives immediate government support, this greatest of all Dutch cultural institutions is in danger of folding by 2016. Now, whether that\u2019s a substantive fear or Met-like, Peter Gelb-style brinkmanship remains to be seen, but it\u2019s clear that Gatti is coming into an orchestra that\u2019s artistically at the top of its game, yet financially threatened as never before. There\u2019s also a recent dispute with the orchestra\u2019s living conscience, Bernard Haitink, whose relationship with the ensemble goes back nearly half a century, and includes almost 25 years as its chief conductor. In March, Haitink said that he wouldn\u2019t guest-conduct the orchestra, in protest against the way he felt sidelined by the management during the orchestra\u2019s 125th anniversary celebrations. He even wanted to hand back his title of honorary conductor.  You would have hoped that relationship can be repaired by the orchestra\u2019s administration. The idea that Haitink won\u2019t ever conduct the Concertgebouw again is a massive loss to music-lovers all over the world, which even the prospect of Gatti\u2019s arrival won\u2019t be able to assuage. Gatti will bring his natural charisma, authority, and energy to the late-romantic and early 20th-century repertoire on which his reputation as a symphonic conductor has so far been built. But how will he extend the Concertgebouw\u2019s artistic culture? Jansons\u2019 decade in charge marked a return to the orchestra\u2019s heartlands of Bruckner, Mahler, and Shostakovich after Riccardo Chailly\u2019s brilliantly adventurous 16 years at the Concertgebouw\u2019s helm.             Gatti is likely to prove a popular choice (and he will certainly have the support of the musicians, since they are the ones who voted for him: in the Concertgebouw\u2019s democratic election process, every player has a say in who is appointed). Yet it\u2019s unlikely he will bring a radical change of repertoire or focus, in the way that other potential candidates for the job might have done, such as Daniel Harding or Ivan Fischer.  But in the short term, he and the Concertgebouw\u2019s general manager, Jan Raes, need to ensure the orchestra\u2019s financial and creative success, and to show the world \u2013 and Holland\u2019s government \u2013 that they are still the best \u2013 and deserve to be celebrated as such in the way they are funded. Gatti\u2019s concerts of Mahler\u2019s 6th Symphony at the end of November, his first as chief conductor-elect, will be especially highly charged performances.

This isn\u2019t a scene from a sci-fi film or a description of the electronics floor in Hamley\u2019s toy shop, it is life inside Netherlands\u2019 new iPad schools. Just over a year ago, seven schools serving 1,000 four- to 12-year-olds opened their doors in cities such as Amsterdam and Almere. Because of their focus on learning through iPads, these institutions \u2013 pioneered by market researcher and entrepreneur Maurice de Hond \u2013 became known as \u201cSteve Jobs schools\u201d. There are now 22 of them across the Netherlands. There are no notebooks, blackboards or even formal lesson plans: children drop into 30-minute workshops on various subjects. There are no seating plans and 45% of learning takes place on an iPad which every child is given when they join. What workshop each pupil goes to is decided by teachers, parents and the pupils themselves as part of their six-week learning plan. De Hond says it is about children achieving specific learning goals with teachers acting as \u201ctalent coaches\u201d. Children must attend school for a full day, but the devices let them learn at any time anywhere, taking screen grabs to indicate their progress to teachers. Marina Donker, who teaches at The Ontplooiing Steve Jobs School in Amsterdam, explains that they use web-based learning programmes which adapt work to a child\u2019s results. \u201cThere are no piles of school notebooks at the and of the day waiting for us. Children can work by themselves in a quiet room; this means that we can work with smaller groups during our workshops.\u201d     A new iPad school opened in Amsterdam this September. Photograph: PR    While these schools offer a unique approach, the use of iPads in classrooms is not new. According to Apple, more than 10m iPads have been purchased by educational institutions worldwide, 7m in the US and 750,000 in the state of Texas alone. De Hond has noticed children getting more self-assured in their learning over the year in his schools. There has been no formal research conducted so far, but De Hond believes iPads are helping children to concentrate for longer, having a particularly positive impact on those who suffer from attention deficit disorder (ADD).  \u201cA lot of the time attention disorders are when someone is bored. If you spend your spare time in a stimulating environment then go to school and are stuck in an uninspiring environment, it\u2019s no wonder children rebel,\u201d he says.  Kim Kampman, who teaches at the main Steve Jobs school in Sneek, says that one child with behavioural difficulties who came to them from a special school is doing well although she acknowledges that for other children the iPad approach, which puts emphasis on independent learning, does not work. \u201cSome children need someone to tell them what to do and cannot pick things up by themselves.\u201d Kampman, however, does say that this it the minority and the school, which started with 60 children, now has 150.     While iPads can encourage independent learning, some children struggle to pick things up by themselves. Photograph: PR    Robin Smorenberg, an Apple distinguished educator (ADE) in the Netherlands, says iPads let children show what they have learnt in ways other than just scoring highly in exams. But, he adds, teachers need a clear idea of what the learning goals are to make sure that alternative modes of testing are reliable. The Steve Jobs schools carry out the same statuary assessments as other Dutch schools and last year Kampman\u2019s school\u2019s scores were \u201cas expected\u201d. She says that the government has been interested in their results but it is still too early to say. \u201cWe\u2019ve only worked [with iPads] for one year so we don\u2019t have a lot of evidence. But we see children are much more motivated and they get more work done independently.\u201d One of the biggest discoveries for De Hond is that iPads can help you reorganise the way a school works. \u201cChildren can do a lot of training in maths and languages with adaptive programmes that take up almost no teacher time. They can follow their own learning path, which might be faster or slower.\u201d This frees up teachers to give more attention to the pupils who need it, De Hond says, adding that giving children their own six-week learning plan devised by them and their parents means they are more engaged in their own education. But Freek Leemhuis, an independent consultant and software developer in the Netherlands, worries that iPads are mainly used by children to consume information rather than be creative. Critics also say there\u2019s something inherently wrong with building your school around a brand. \u201cSchools are independent and shouldn\u2019t be linked to a product,\u201d says ESRC future research leader, Andrew Manches, who works at the University of Edinburgh.     Critics of the Steve Jobs schools say there is something inherently wrong with building your school around a brand. Photograph: PR    For Kampman the biggest challenge has been how you follow the development of a child who is learning through an iPad. \u201cChildren can practice on an app but you cannot always see how they did it. The challenge is following children in a way that you can see how they have done something.\u201d Manches says that there is a lot of rhetoric around technology and \u201cpersonalised\u201d learning, but he thinks that while apps are useful in telling you what you\u2019ve got right they are not always good at explaining things to children. Children often learn a lot from understanding their mistakes. Then there is the coordination of it, with issues around data protection, setting iPads up and replacing them with the latest model. Manches says: \u201cIf all children\u2019s data is online then that needs to be protected. It\u2019s important to know what infrastructure and training is needed and what works in one school won\u2019t necessarily work elsewhere.\u201d In terms of the finances, Kampman says the government-funded schools provide every child with an iPad and parents pay just \u20ac16 a year for their child to attend. In the time they have been open, of the 150 iPads, five have been broken and a few needed to be replaced.  In Steve Jobs schools children are also free to use the internet on their devices. If a child finds a website that is unsuitable they tell their teacher, says Kampman. \u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of the teacher to make sure children know how to use the internet and what to do if they find something inappropriate.\u201d Schools in the UK have made some movement towards using iPads, with an estimated 500 British schools using the devices. The Stephen Perse Foundation in Cambridge has gone a step further, weaving tablets into the curriculum. De Hond says those looking to copy the Steve Jobs school model should first think about what children should learn if they are to be prepared for the future. \u201cUse the tablet to redefine the school and not just as an extension of what you\u2019re currently doing,\u201d he says. Despite his reservations, Manches is keen to see what results they have in the Netherlands. He says that education needs evangelists but also critical voices to help other schools understand how and why things are working. \u201cWhat we hear nowadays is that things are great but it would be nice to have case studies of what works and how it can be replicated. We need critical debate.\u201d Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach.

Though poles apart, both works are in some respects about solitude. Tapdance is a percussion concerto with a melancholy edge. The orchestral sound is poised somewhere between classical and big band, and the work is dominated by a sad, three-part blues, during which Currie plays \u201cthis lonely part for a percussionist\u201d, as Andriessen calls it, tapping wood blocks to imitate the sound of a dancer\u2019s feet, negotiating a big, nostalgic marimba solo, and finally beating out muffled tympani strokes as the work throbs to its close. Stressing the lyrical side of Currie\u2019s musicianship, sometimes at the expense of his more familiar athleticism, it\u2019s a beautiful score, at once graceful and deeply touching. Secret Garden, in contrast, is a drum kit solo for a star. Clyne\u2019s starting point was the fact that Currie was named Colin after a character in Frances Hodgson Burnett\u2019s The Secret Garden, and his virtuoso and devil-may-care solo accompanies and at times threatens to obliterate a tape of himself reading passages from the book. The pounding opening section is fractionally too long, though halfway through the work turns into a creepily effective exercise in musical gothic with the on-tape addition of harp and organ to the texture.

She carried two white T-shirts, each bearing a block-capital inscription: \u201cI AM A VERY SPECIAL MAN\u201d and \u201cI AM A SPERM DONOR\u201d. The plan was to show unsuspecting commuters one followed by the other, to test a theory that might have seemed self-evident: men were happy to be seen as special, but they were less eager to talk about their sperm. Witjens, a striking blonde Dutchwoman wearing a black-and-white striped dress, picked out a young man with slicked-back hair named Andrey, who was handing out samples of a new Dior perfume. Witjens said she\u2019d take one if he spoke to her for 20 seconds. \u201cIf I tell you you\u2019re a very special man, how would you feel?\u201d she asked. \u201cWell it can either go one way or another,\u201d Andrey said, smile budding. \u201cArnold Schwarzenegger or disabled.\u201d Witjens held up the \u201cI AM A SPERM DONOR\u201d T-shirt. \u201cIf I call you this, what do you say?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d laugh,\u201d said Andrey, who was starting to shift on his feet. \u201cWhy?\u201d He paused. \u201cI think it\u2019s what people do but don\u2019t talk about.\u201d Witjens gave Andrey a glow-in-the-dark sperm key ring (\u201cThat\u2019s awesome! That is going straight on my car key!\u201d) and moved on to five men gathered around a pile of camping equipment and backpacks, on their way to a music festival on the Isle of Wight. They giggled and swapped gags about the superlative quality of their seed. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually gone anywhere and knowingly donated sperm,\u201d one quipped. Witjens decided to change tack. Groups were too easily derailed by innuendo and self-consciousness. Better to target men on their own. She homed in on a young guy sitting on a bench, his bag neatly by his side. \u201cI\u2019d happily be a sperm donor,\u201d he said, unperturbed by her T-shirt routine. \u201cHave you thought about it?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes, when I\u2019ve been really low on cash.\u201d They chatted for a while, Witjens enthusiastic and excitable. She pressed the sperm key ring into his hand, and gave him another handful for his friends. \u201cYou know why I saw you?\u201d she said, pointing to his chest. \u201cI saw \u2018Holland\u2019 and I\u2019m Dutch and I thought, yeah! That\u2019s a good guy.\u201d He looked a little bemused - he was wearing a black \u2018Mulholland Drive\u2019 T-shirt under his checked shirt \u2013 but smiled anyway. Witjens is used to having these conversations. As the chief executive of the National Gamete Donation Trust (NGDT), a government-funded charitable body, her job is to promote egg and sperm donation in the UK. She raises the subject whenever she can: with taxi drivers and fellow train passengers \u2013 anywhere men can\u2019t easily escape. A friend of hers told me she\u2019d recently accosted someone at a party: \u201cYou do have to rein her in sometimes.\u201d In return, Witjens hears \u201ceverybody\u2019s personal, sexual or erectile dysfunction. Sometimes it makes me grin, sometimes I just switch off.\u201d A few years ago, just after the NGDT launched another campaign to attract new donors (\u201cHave you got the balls?\u201d was the tagline), she went to a rugby club in Rochdale, offered the team curry and beer after the game, and then surprised them with a multi-speaker presentation on sperm donation. At nearly 50 \u2013 married to her second husband \u2013 Witjens thinks she can broach the subject with impunity: \u201cI\u2019m the age where they know I\u2019m not coming on to them,\u201d she told me. \u201cI could be their mother.\u201d * * * In Britain, donor sperm is a scarce commodity. In 1992, the first year that records were kept, there were only 375 new sperm donors in the country. By 2004, the year before the law was changed to forbid anonymous donations, the number had fallen to 239, as potential donors melted away at the thought of being confronted by future children. Jane Stewart, a consultant who runs a sperm bank and fertility clinic in Newcastle, told me she had to shelve her entire donor bank in 2004 and start again, as not one of her donors was willing to become identifiable. In 2010, the last year for which numbers are available, there were 480 new donors \u2013 an apparent improvement, but one that has failed to keep pace with the enormous increase in demand for sperm, mostly from lesbian couples and single women. According to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), between 2010 and 2011 there was a 24% increase in the number of lesbian couples undergoing donor insemination. Over three decades, a cultural transformation had occurred: in the 1970s and 1980s, open discussion of fertility treatment was rare. One parent of donor-conceived children born in 1984 and 1986 told me that she and her husband were encouraged \u201cnot to think about\u201d who the donor was, or to tell their children how they were conceived. Now, parents are advised to tell their children the truth of their genetic heritage from birth, and moral outrage over \u201calternative families\u201d has become a relatively fringe pursuit. But while the shift in culture has transformed the demand, it hasn\u2019t boosted the supply. While the public are broadly comfortable with the idea of potential parents conceiving children from donated sperm, the discomfort around donation itself \u2013 the act that enables these new lives \u2013 lingers on. Allan Pacey, the outgoing chair of the British Fertility Society, called the persistent unease \u201cmasturbation guilt\u201d. \u201cWomen who donate their eggs are heroes,\u201d he told me. \u201cMen who donate their sperm I still think are considered smutty because they have to masturbate. If we extracted sperm in a surgical procedure, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have the same view of it.\u201d     Illustration by Jean Jullien    As a result, there aren\u2019t enough donors to go round and clinics have to plug the gap with imported sperm. In 2005, one in 10 donated sperm samples came from overseas; now the figure is one in four. The sperm comes mostly from the US or from Denmark \u2013 the sperm capital of the world, as it is invariably known in smirking press reports warning of a \u201csecond Viking invasion\u201d. But even when a clinic is importing, patients still have to wait at least a year for sperm to become available. Many resort to alternatives: travelling abroad for treatment or using informal introduction services such as the website Pride Angel, which operates like a dating site, matching patients with appropriate donors. Some resort to unregulated online infertility forums, where potential donors \u2013 with screen names such as geezer666, ShireHorse, RealMan, bigD and tadpolesready \u2013 offer their untested, unscreened and possibly unsafe sperm for free. No one has any real idea of the scale of this grey market. When I asked Juliet Tizzard at the HFEA, which regulates the sector, why they weren\u2019t doing more to police such potentially dangerous activity, she shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s been a reluctance to intervene in that area, because it\u2019s so close to normal human interaction \u2026 How far away is that from meeting someone in a bar in Shoreditch?\u201d To tackle the shortage, and provide a more salubrious alternative to the online underworld, a new National Sperm Bank, based at the Birmingham Women\u2019s Hospital, will launch at the end of this month. (Its announcement, in early August, was greeted with a front-page Mail on Sunday headline: \u201cNHS To Fund Sperm Bank For Lesbians: New Generation of Fatherless Families Paid For By YOU\u201d.) Funded by the Department of Health, and run by Laura Witjens, the new bank will provide a central store of sperm for both private and NHS clinics, so they no longer have to buy from overseas. Witjens also hopes the very fact of its creation \u2013 and the attendant publicity \u2013 will by itself encourage more donors to come forward. She initially panicked at the Mail headline \u2013 until she spent a day defending the new bank on 24-hour news channels and radio phone-ins, and realised people were suddenly talking about sperm. Plans for a National Sperm Bank have been under discussion, on and off, for a decade. The concept was first raised back in 2004, according to Pacey. Everyone in the sector knew the change in the law on anonymity would dampen donor recruitment, he said; it was thought that a national approach might help with the fall-off. A working group was set up in 2006, and a pilot project launched in Manchester in 2008. It was soon disbanded, though no one in the sector seemed able to tell me why. Witjens implied there had been a difference in view over strategy. Six years later, Birmingham was chosen in part because she has a good working relationship with the clinical team at the hospital. As she told me: \u201cBirmingham was prepared to say, \u2018OK, you tell us what can be done; show us.\u2019\u201d I met Witjens for the first time on a sunny afternoon in August at her red-brick, gated house in Surrey. We sat at a table in her large kitchen and she told me how she wrote the proposal for the new bank last October in two days straight, after she\u2019d seen the Department of Health had opened a new funding round. \u201cI thought, \u2018It\u2019s now or never. I rang Birmingham and said, \u2018Don\u2019t ask me for the details because I don\u2019t know them yet, but if I put in a bid, will you partner with me?\u2019 And they said, \u2018If it\u2019s you, any day.\u2019\u201d It had to be her. There\u2019s no one else. The NGDT \u2013 the national body for sperm and egg donation \u2013 consists of Witjens and Pip Morris, the donor recruitment manager, who deals with inquiries from potential donors and patients. Pip is the \u201csolid one\u201d; Witjens tackles the \u201cvisionary stuff\u201d. She often talks about herself like this. During a series of meetings and conversations, Witjens variously described herself to me as a \u201cbulldozer\u201d, \u201ca bit in your face\u201d, someone with \u201ca much louder voice than quite a few people together\u201d whose personality is born of her nationality, the \u201csheer force of her Dutchness\u201d, as she put it \u2013 a combination of ebullient confidence and a bracing ability to straight-talk. Her LinkedIn profile sums it up: \u201cA driven pragmatic no-nonsense change maker with a 3D approach: Dutch, Direct, Delivers.\u201d     Laura Witjens at Birmingham Women\u2019s Fertility Centre, site of the National Sperm Bank which opens on 31 October. Photograph: Graeme Robertson    Witjens\u2019s father was a rear admiral, her mother an artist: \u201cI got the touchy-feely from my mother, and the drive and determination from my father.\u201d After studying law in Amsterdam, she worked in sales for IT firms, and then set up her own company, Multiplexx Technologies, with a business partner, which, she said, made her \u201cshitloads\u201d of money. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that I was always the head of class girl.\u201d But more than any professional success, she wanted children. Even as a 20-year-old, Witjens said, she realised she would have done anything \u2013 \u201cillegal, immoral, unethical\u201d \u2013 to have them. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t have to: in 1998, she gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl. When they were still young, Witjens saw an item on television about egg donation and decided to become a donor, keen to help anyone who wanted to have children as much as she had but wasn\u2019t able to do it naturally. It was an \u201camazing feeling\u201d, she said \u2013 not the injections, the invasive procedures, the simulated menopause \u2013 but the realisation that she could transform lives. Afterwards, having felt unsupported through the process, she hunted out the NGDT, which at the time was fairly low profile, and didn\u2019t have a website. She made one, changed the logo, became a trustee, then interim chair, then chair. Head of class. \u201cSomehow it went from five hours to 10 hours to 15 hours\u201d, she recalled, until she realised she could no longer combine her work for the NGDT with co-running her company. She sold her share, and after eight years of working for free for the Trust, became chief executive in 2012 and began receiving a salary (\u201cin the \u00a340,000 range\u201d). Compared with her former lifestyle \u2013 \u201cbig cars, fancy life, huge income\u201d \u2013 it wasn\u2019t much. But the work made up for it: \u201cI\u2019m often seen as the ball-breaker, but I came into this business as an egg donor. I\u2019m still the one who at the weekend speaks to the patients and cries with the patients, the one who\u2019s got baby pictures on my desk because babies are named after me.\u201d When she put in the proposal for the new bank she told the Department of Health that if they didn\u2019t stump up the cash, she would do it herself. As she told me this, she gestured expansively. \u201cYou see my house.\u201d The budget that Witjens has calculated for the first year of the National Sperm Bank amounts to \u00a377,000. She thinks the bank can become self-financing within a year, covering its costs by selling sperm at \u00a3300 a sample to other clinics. There will be no new glass-and-steel building with vaults of sperm marshalled by white-coated laboratory assistants, no tellers doling out samples over the counter. The bank will be housed at a pre-existing fertility centre and sperm bank at Birmingham Women\u2019s Hospital, run by Dr Sue Avery. It will be staffed by those who work at the Birmingham bank, all two of them: Maureen Marrs, the donor recruitment co-ordinator, and Rachel Jennings, the fertility preservation practitioner. Marrs showed me round. The \u201cbank\u201d itself is simply one small room containing a handful of metal tanks where sperm samples are frozen in liquid nitrogen at around -196 degrees. If there\u2019s no new building, no new staff, what is it? Witjens described the project to me as \u201cbuilding a bit on the front and a bit on the end\u201d of the existing Birmingham bank. That is, launching a donor recruitment campaign and quickening the distribution to other clinics. It is, she said, a \u201csales and marketing\u201d challenge \u2013 her strength. Recently, she was shortlisted in a national Specsavers competition to find the \u201cSpectacle Wearer of the Year 2014\u201d (she submitted her picture while bored one afternoon). She thought that if she could reach the final she might persuade the host, TV presenter Gok Wan, to become an ambassador for sperm donation. This is how she works, more flair than forensic, a committed opportunist. (It doesn\u2019t always go down well: as another player in the sector put it to me, \u201cfundamentally, she\u2019s a businesswoman\u201d.)    For every 100 people who get in contact about sperm donation, only one goes on to become a donor       Discussions about how the new bank will work alongside the Birmingham clinic are still ongoing. A new text service and website for the National Sperm Bank will soon be launched: donors who make contact through these portals will be directed to the national side, while donors who come through the Birmingham website will go to the local bank. If they\u2019re inundated with potential donors, Witjens told me, they\u2019ll recruit extra staff. But whatever happens, there will be nothing new to see when it launches. The National Sperm Bank is essentially an advert \u2013 an attempt to bring the public conversation about sperm donation into line with a culture that\u2019s no longer so squeamish about conceiving children by \u201cartificial\u201d means. * * * Recruiting sperm donors is both laborious and complicated. For every 100 people who contact the NGDT about sperm donation, only one goes on to become a donor. Some are weeded out early after their samples fail quality tests \u2013 for shape, concentration and motility. Others drop out once they understand the implications. As Andrey in Waterloo station put it, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be one of those people in 18 years where it\u2019s like, \u2018Hi Dad\u2019.\u201d Donor sperm can be used to create up to 10 sets of children; parents are allowed to use the same donor to create siblings. One donor-conceived young woman I spoke to knew from the records held by the HFEA that she had 15 half-siblings. That\u2019s quite a queue. Interested donors also fall away once they learn what giving sperm actually involves. Donors are obliged to visit a clinic between 10 and 20 times (depending on the concentration of high-quality sperm in their ejaculate) over a period of three to six months. Clinics request that a donor refrain from sexual activity for three or four days before a visit, which can amount in some cases to half a year of near-celibacy. Donors are paid a regulated flat fee of \u00a335 per visit: \u00a320 at the time of each donation, and the remainder as a lump sum at the end, to stop people dropping out halfway through. The payment is purposefully small, to discourage donors from doing it only for the money. One donor I met at the Birmingham clinic, called John, told me that he decided to donate after his mother died. He had no children of his own, and wanted her, in some way, to live on. John was typical: after the law on anonymity changed, the profile of donors shifted from younger men, mostly students doing it for a bit of extra cash, to older men who signed up for altruistic reasons. \u201cIt sounds trite,\u201d said John, a quiet 40-year-old, \u201cbut you\u2019ve done something good for the day.\u201d When he completed his donation cycle, he took his final sum of \u00a3100 or so and bought a new golf club. Visits, donations. This is a world heavy with euphemism. Many clinics call the room where men go to give their sperm donation the \u201cproduction room\u201d. In Birmingham, it\u2019s known as the \u201cprocurement room\u201d, and Marrs showed it to me on our tour. There\u2019s a sofa, a toilet, pictures on the wall of a starfish and a jetty. Outside there\u2019s a doorbell for the men to ring when the sample is ready to be collected by staff. Donors can enter through a back entrance so they never need come into contact with patients. The only hint of what takes place inside this clinical chamber is the blue ringbinder of porn magazines placed discreetly to one side. The pages are laminated.     Sperm samples are dyed in the lab so they can be tracked during analysis. Photograph: Graeme Robertson    The weight of what Pacey called \u201cmasturbation guilt\u201d is not to be underestimated. Another donor, a 42-year-old man who I\u2019ll call James, said his decision was a deeply private one. I\u2019d found James on an online infertility forum, offering advice to women seeking informal donors on how to go about it safely. In what can seem like a seedy demimonde of sperm exchange, where men offer to \u201cnaturally inseminate\u201d women \u2013 in other words, to meet up and have sex with them \u2013 James seemed like a sensible voice. We met in a Costa Coffee off the M5, and he came carrying a packet of photos of two baby girls born from his donations. James was unusual: he\u2019d donated officially, through an NHS clinic in the south-west, as well as privately, through a co-parenting website that matches couples with donors. The babies, who he has met and held, were the results of informal arrangements \u2013 he\u2019d remained in touch with the parents, and they\u2019d kept him updated on the pregnancy, birth, growing up. Three other women to whom he has donated are pregnant. James showed me pictures of the babies swimming and playing, one dressed up as a pink rabbit. He was visibly proud of what he\u2019d done, but he didn\u2019t want me to use his name, say where he lived or even name the NHS clinic where he\u2019d donated his sperm. He\u2019d never told his family \u2013 strict Catholics who would doubtless be horrified \u2013 and after he told a close friend, who was \u201cmortified\u201d and told James he\u2019d end up a dirty old man, he decided to keep the fact that he\u2019d helped create five new human lives a secret. * * * The world\u2019s largest sperm bank, Cryos International \u2013 in Aarhus, Denmark\u2019s second city \u2013 exports sperm to more than 70 countries; its website boasts that it has more than 400 donor samples on ice, ready to deliver right now. The bank was set up by Ole Schou in 1987 after he had a dream about frozen sperm which (understandably) intrigued him. Afterwards, Schou read everything he could on the subject and recognised an opportunity. There was rising demand for sperm and a limited, inefficient supply. For a graduate student in business, it wasn\u2019t difficult to see. At the start, Schou rented a nine-metre-squared office and cycled round town pasting up posters calling for donors. His marketing line is the same now as it was then: earn money and help infertile couples. Today, he told me, he has several donors who have enabled well over 100 births around the world. Schou\u2019s rapid expansion was helped by Denmark\u2019s cultural openness (\u201cit is not difficult in this country to talk about sperm donation\u201d) and social spirit. \u201cWe share everything,\u201d he said. But he was also enabled by Danish law, which required donors to be anonymous; they were much easier to recruit. Now donors can choose to be either anonymous or identifiable \u2013 but that\u2019s only because Schou lobbied for a change in the law so he could recruit non-anonymous donors for export to countries such as the UK. Recruiting these donors is still challenging, but Schou told me he\u2019d found a loophole. The British rules on anonymity don\u2019t apply if you deliver directly to people\u2019s homes, rather than to clinics. Schou sends his sperm round the world, with a home-insemination kit (\u201cone adaptor, one syringe, one alcohol pad\u201d) included in the package. Two straws of raw, anonymous sperm cost \u20ac178 (excluding VAT). Non-anonymous sperm is more than double, at \u20ac398, and the prices increase depending on the chosen delivery method. If you pick up dry-ice stored sperm from the bank, you pay an additional \u20ac39; a European delivery in a nitrogen tank is \u20ac219. Then there are the variations according to quality \u2013 purified sperm (which has been \u201cwashed\u201d of seminal fluid) is more expensive, as is sperm from donors with higher motility. An exclusive donor, meanwhile, would cost \u20ac12,000. \u201cEvery day\u201d, Schou told me, he receives orders online for sperm from British clients opting for home insemination with sperm from a donor they\u2019ll never have to meet. Every British expert I talked to was appalled by Schou\u2019s loophole. \u201cHe\u2019s running right up to the wire,\u201d said Olivia Montuschi, the founder of the Donor Conception Network (DCN), a group that supports families created through donation. \u201cHe makes me want to spit with anger ... he never thinks about the children.\u201d (It\u2019s true that amid all the marketing strategies and global competition, the children can be overlooked.) Sue Avery pointed out that Schou\u2019s loophole only remains legal if the recipient inseminates immediately after receiving their package from Cryos. Anyone found to be storing sperm in the UK without an HFEA-awarded licence is breaking the law. Last August, a case was reported of a mother who forced her adopted 14-year-old daughter to home-inseminate with Cryos-bought sperm after she was prevented from adopting any more children. The woman was sentenced to five years in jail after admitting child cruelty. Schou was unmoved: she could have got hold of free, unscreened sperm on the internet if she\u2019d wanted to, and anyway, \u201cit\u2019s not the weapon that harms, it\u2019s those who use the weapon. And you can easily get weapons.\u201d Schou, the arch-liberal of sperm donation, told me that Britain\u2019s problem was overly burdensome regulation that pushed people overseas or to the grey market \u2013 the murky online world of ovulation-day hook-ups. He compared fertility treatment to abortion. No one wants to have it, but given that people always will, why not make it as easy as possible? \u201cPeople create lives every day without interference from the state.\u201d So long as regulation in Britain remains tight, he couldn\u2019t see how the National Sperm Bank would succeed: in his view, they won\u2019t be able to recruit enough non-anonymous donors to become self-sustaining. In 2010, Schou wanted to set up a branch of Cryos in the UK to meet the growing demand, but only on the condition that he could also recruit anonymous donors for export. He put the proposal to the HFEA, which refused. Schou backed out. \u201cWe calculated from a business point of view that it was simply not feasible.\u201d * * * Beneath the inevitable snickering when sperm donation comes up in conversation lies a Victorian legacy: a peculiarly British cocktail of sexual awkwardness and moralising piety. \u201cReligious roots,\u201d Allan Pacey said. Birmingham was a prime candidate for the National Sperm Bank not only because there\u2019s a successful clinic at the hospital but also for its demographics. The shortage of ethnic minority donors across the UK is severe \u2013 according to Witjens, South Asian couples have to wait five years or more for sperm \u2013 and Birmingham\u2019s population skews young, male and Muslim. They\u2019re hard to reach. \u201cDifferent imams have different teachings,\u201d explained Sue Avery, but \u201csperm donation for Muslims is not generally accepted. The problem for a lot of religious groups is that the concept of donor sperm comes under the heading of adultery.\u201d Avery, who has been in the fertility business for 30 years, remembered being visited by an Orthodox rabbi at the central London clinic where she worked in the early 1980s. He\u2019d come to bless some donor sperm for a Jewish couple\u2019s fertility treatment and \u201ctook the view that if he blessed the sperm, they could use it\u201d. Witjens\u2019s strategy for countering both the religiously opposed and awkwardly British is to refashion donation into something heroic. She wants men to be able to talk about giving sperm the way they might about giving blood or donating organs: proud, even boastful. The last thing they should feel is shame. Children conceived by donors agree. One I spoke to \u2013 Sam Gregory, a 23-year-old civil servant from Sheffield \u2013 thought donors should be far more visible in society. Gregory\u2019s own donor is untraceable \u2013 he was conceived just before regulation, and therefore record-keeping. But he felt donors should be able to talk openly about what they do, as blood donors do. There should be posters on buses, like the ones you see for adoption. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an advert anywhere for people to donate sperm,\u201d he said. In early September, I sat in on a meeting between Witjens and Diane Dykes, a marketing adviser tasked with refining the message of the National Sperm Bank. The pair were perched on bar stools in the kitchen of Dykes\u2019s house in Basingstoke. They\u2019d worked together before, Witjens told me, and Dykes was used to translating Witjens\u2019s sometimes wayward ideas into concrete plans. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of spaghetti that goes round,\u201d Dykes explained. They had a laptop open in front of them and browsed other sperm bank websites, comparing different recruitment strategies. Simply Sperm Donors, a private bank in Essex, asked, \u201cWho gives a toss?\u201d Birmingham\u2019s current sell was a picture of a piggy bank and the line, \u201cWe\u2019re not just any bank\u201d. They agreed that the pigs were confusing. \u201cIt\u2019s almost having a sperm donation website without mentioning the word sperm,\u201d Witjens said.     Ole Schou, the founder and director of the world\u2019s largest sperm bank, Cryos \u00adInternational \u2013 in Aarhus, Denmark. Photograph: Mads Nissen/Panos Pictures    The pair moved on to discuss Witjens\u2019s personal website (she needs to \u201cmanage her own brand, otherwise someone else will manage it for her\u201d, Dykes told me). The draft version had large pictures of Witjens above the logos of the NGDT, the Donor Conceived Register (a database of all those born through donor conception, which she also runs), and the new bank. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like looking at the Oprah Winfrey brand,\u201d said Witjens. \u201cShe knows she\u2019s the person in the middle, but in addition all sorts of things hang off it that actually help people \u2026 I want to do something very much like that in the donation world.\u201d The businesswoman in her can see that the fertility world is rich in potential. While she likes the integrity and independence government funding gives the new bank, in the long term, she\u2019d like to start up projects on her own \u2013 a sperm bank specifically for lesbians, perhaps. If it all sounds a little like The Laura Show, she\u2019ll take the hit. \u201cI am the name. It can work for me or it can work against me.\u201d And if it doesn\u2019t work? She smiled at me, as if the idea was amusing. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Witjens\u2019s competitive spirit extends to her tactics. She believes she can challenge Birmingham men to prove they have the best sperm in Britain, and British men to prove they have better sperm than the Danish. \u201cI want to kick the Danish sperm banks out,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m fed up with the whole Viking thing.\u201d Ole Schou\u2019s gloomy prognosis didn\u2019t unsettle her. It doesn\u2019t matter if most men don\u2019t want to become donors. \u201cWe don\u2019t need millions of guys; we only need thousands.\u201d    The best donors are comfortable with the idea of creating children who might one day turn up at their door       In fact, according to her calculations, they only need to find 13 in the first year for the National Sperm Bank to break even. But to get those 13 means testing the sperm of 130, and to test 130 means reaching out to hundreds, thousands more. But ultimately, Witjens only wants the ones who are in it for the right reasons \u2013 altruism, not cash. The best donors are the ones who have thought the process through; the ones who are comfortable with the idea of creating children who might one day turn up at their door. The ones like James with his packet of photos, who told me that a year ago, he had a middle-of-the-night moment \u2013 wondering, as a single man in his early forties, what he was doing with his life. \u201cI thought there are probably plenty of people who have met the person of their dreams, but for some reason they can\u2019t have children,\u201d he told me. \u201cAt least I can give someone that hope and that dream.\u201d Sam Gregory, the donor-conceived child, paused for a while when I asked him if he\u2019d ever thought about donating sperm himself. \u201cStrangely, I\u2019ve never felt a strong urge to.\u201d As he doesn\u2019t have any medical information about his biological father, he thought he might not be allowed to anyway, and would be worried about passing on a hereditary illness he didn\u2019t yet know about.

There are many ways to cultivate such a mus\u00e9e imaginaire of the art you really love. One of the most convenient and aesthetically stunning is Google Art Project, a bold venture that offers an ever-growing digital archive of the world\u2019s greatest art, which you can browse wherever you are and out of which you can assemble your own personal gallery online, a fantasy collection of your favourite art. Many of the world\u2019s finest museums cooperate with the project, and no wonder. The internet is loaded with images of art of hugely varying qualities, many simply scanned out of old art books. It would be nice if there were other similar projects out there but Google has, characteristically, monopolised this one, and set a gold standard for art reproductions online. Its high-definition photographs of great paintings, created in collaboration with places like the National Gallery in London and the Uffizi in Florence, allow you to zoom in to study the ridges and drips and brushmarks on the surface of a picture \u2013 to appreciate the texture, not simply the iconic image, of a work of art.     How to use a Google art gallery.    Is it like being there? Not quite. There are so many features of art that can only be appreciated in its actual presence: the weight, scale, even smell of art is absent from a digital scan, however magnificent. But we can\u2019t all be jetting off to Moma in New York every time we want to look at Van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night. This way, you can see it in mesmerising closeup, savouring the passionate marks and impulses of Vincent\u2019s brush, wherever you are. You can also sample the galleries created by users, from museum directors to you and me. Sign in and create your own gallery, or just browse the richest assembly of art on the internet, from conceptual art to Chinese paintings. I\u2019m a sucker for seeing great paintings and drawings on the project, not because they are inherently better but because its microscopic accuracy makes their nuances so fascinating to explore. The Royal Collection is one of Google\u2019s collaborators, and my personal gallery of masterpieces begins with a red chalk drawing it owns by Michelangelo of a group of nude men shooting arrows (Archers Shooting at a Herm). It is sensual and strong, and you can close in on Michelangelo\u2019s genius. Then I chose The Adoration of the Magi by his contemporary Leonardo da Vinci, in the Uffizi. This mysterious, tantalising, unfinished visionary masterpiece becomes even more enigmatic when you look closely at its shadowy details. Van Gogh\u2019s painting The Bedroom, from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, is an intense expression of loneliness and longing as the troubled artist portrays himself through the stuff in his room. Its powerfully built-up paint can be seen in squidgy, oily technicolour close-up. So can the broken, hesitant, ambivalent searchings of C\u00e9zanne in his great painting The Chateau Noir from Moma. Finally, from the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris, I chose Rousseau\u2019s primeval dream painting The Snake Charmer, sinking into its green world whenever I like. Quite a private collection \u2013 and with this powerful tool for learning about and enjoying art, you too can own the greatest masterpieces on earth.

The tone indicated it was no platitude. So too, the demeanour of one of the A-League\u2019s most experienced \u2013 and underrated \u2013 coaches suggested this year could indeed be a watershed for New Zealand\u2019s only professional club. In what is expected to be the most competitive A-League season yet, Wellington feature on few pundits\u2019 most-favoured lists. And you get the impression Merrick and his charges are comfortable with the fly-under-the-radar-approach. It will make success, should it come, all the sweeter. In seven previous A-League campaigns the club have reached the finals three times, all compacted into a golden run between 2010-12. The less said about their predecessors \u2013 the Auckland-based New Zealand Knights the better. So why should this season be any different for the Phoenix, than their last two since reaching the play-offs under former boss Ricki Herbert? For a start Merrick says the team will be more settled and in-tune with his playing philosophy, following a full season under the two-time championship-winning coach. \u201cNow they fully understand how to play together, because they have been together so long. And now we have got depth. I\u2019m going to have very high quality players sitting on the bench, and that is a huge difference to a coach.\u201d Then there is the playing roster. Merrick believes his side are significantly stronger than last year, be it by way of recruitment, players maturing or returning to full fitness. Heading the list is a Dutch midfielder who Merrick holds in the highest esteem. The fact the exotically-monikered Roly Bonevacia is barely-known in this part of the world is fine with Merrick. The Scottish-born coach waxes lyrical about his new 22-year-old recruit to anyone who will listen.  \u201cApparently he gave the ball away a couple of years ago,\u201d quipped Merrick when asked about the qualities of his new Dutchman schooled by the famed Ajax Amsterdam academy. Bonevacia will be in good company in the centre of the park where there will be a distinct Spanish flavour. Alex Rodriguez has arrived from Tenerife, while Albert Riera is tipped for a massive season from many astute judges. Not that Merrick is necessarily an advocate of Barcelona-style possession statistics meaning everything. \u201cYou have to keep the ball, certainly, but you have to get forward with the ball and into goalscoring positions,\u201d Merrick says. \u201cControlling possession around the opposition penalty area is the important statistic.\u201d Throw in the impetus provided by midfielder Michael McGlinchey after a protracted move from Central Coast Mariners, and the Phoenix posses a talented bunch, yet one which has been missed by the headline writers. With the supremely gifted \u2013 albeit enigmatic \u2013 Nathan Burns and Jeremy Brockie in the forward line, fans at Wellington\u2019s \u201cCake Tin\u201d could be in for some fun. It would make a contrast for some occasionally austere past seasons when it came to attacking flair. Getting the best out of the raw talent is perhaps the greatest challenge facing Merrick. There are plenty of other interesting names in the Wellington Phoenix side: Australian-turned-New Zealand international Andrew Durante; U-20 youth international Alex Rufer (nephew of former star All Whites Wynton) and Oceania poster boy, Fijian striker Roy Krishna. It is the perfect time to launch a new era for the New Zealand side.

But behind the quaintness is a progressive nightlife scene, which culminates each October in one of the world\u2019s biggest electronic music showcases, Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE). Ahead of next week\u2019s five-day festival and conference \u2013 which draws more than 2,000 international electronic artists, who can be found performing in any corner of the city that can fit a sound system \u2013 I dropped by for a snapshot of the after-dark experience. I recruited local DJ and producer Marco Sterk, better known as Young Marco, to take me on a tour of his favourite spots that tell the story of how, over the past two decades, Amsterdam has grown into one of Europe\u2019s most important dance music destinations.       We meet in the city centre, in an alley outside Red Light Radio \u2013 a former brothel that\u2019s now an important hub for local DJs \u2013 before cycling over to another historic base for the city\u2019s electronic scene; Rush Hour Records. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know what to do for the night, this is the place to find out what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Marco, handing me a slickly designed flyer for the last party he played at. \u201cFor the last fifteen years it\u2019s been the most important thing for underground dance music. It\u2019s been a platform for people to come up through, like local heroes San Proper and Tom Trago, and even myself.\u201d      Cafe Belgique may be small, but it hasn\u2019t stopped them cramming in a DJ booth. Photograph: PR    As it reaches 7pm we nip over to Caf\u00e9 Belgique for our first drink. Vintage beer signs fill the walls of the tiny pub, and a giant pair of red lips hangs from the ceiling in the corner. \u201cI think the tourists are scared to walk in, it looks too local,\u201d says Marco. The pub may be one of the smallest in the city, but that hasn\u2019t stopped it squeezing a set of decks in, providing a tiny yet atmospheric stage for undergound DJs. I ask Marco what makes his city\u2019s nightlife special. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely concentrated city,\u201d he says. Then he adds what, for me at least, will always be the clincher: \u201cAnd you can always be home in five minutes on your bike.\u201d     Tolhuistuin is Amsterdam Noord\u2019s latest hang out.  Photograph: PR    We take a detour, via the IJ ferry, over to the ever cooler Amsterdam Noord to drop in on Tolhuistuin, a chic venue with an outdoor stage enclosed by trees and twinkling lights that is one of the city\u2019s newest cultural spots. By 2016 the Noord district will host an even bigger, more commercial venue: the Adam tower, once a Royal Dutch Shell office block, which is being renovated into a complex \u201cfor creatives\u201d, that will include basement club, bar, restaurant and viewing platform.

Photograph: ADE    Back in the main city, we head south to the Leidseplein area for a drink at one of the city\u2019s long-running bars, Cafe Lux, which Marco tells me is \u201cthe only non-seedy late night bar in the city\u201d. Lux and Weber (a neighbouring sister bar run by the same people) have been favourite drinking spots for the city\u2019s creative types \u2013 or indeed anyone who doesn\u2019t need to get up early during the week \u2013 for almost 30 years. A relaxed door policy (\u201canyone is welcome as long as they behave\u201d, the manager tells me) means both are crammed full most nights. It\u2019s also the perfect bouncing-off point for two of Amsterdam\u2019s biggest venues: the elegant Paradiso concert hall and Melkweg housed in a former dairy. And not too far away, mid-way up the Overtoom, is former squat OT301 \u2013 an arts venue with a cube-like interior that hosts regular club nights.     House party vibes: inside retro bar De Nieuwe Anita  Photograph: Wilmar Dik/REX    Next up is another old favourite, De Nieuwe Anita. Dressed up like a vintage living room, with stylish retro furniture, patterned wallpaper and a jam jar of single cigarettes for sale on the bar, it\u2019s an easy-going venue popular with the art school crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s like a party in someone\u2019s house,\u201d says Marco, as we walk down the staircase into the basement club, where DJ Alex Figueira is playing a selection from his funk and afro-beat collection. \u201cYou can have any kind of night here.\u201d Ready to hit a club, we cycle to Studio 80 on Rembrandtplein. Hidden but for a dark doorway and the queue outside, it\u2019s a small, old-school venue \u2013 \u201clike a black box,\u201d says Marco. The club has been around for a few years, but has a new, young, programmer who keeps the line-ups fresh and uncompromised. Inside, young clubbers dance to thumping house music from its bespoke sound system, surrounded by flashing strip lights.     Underground, overground: the industrial interior of Trouw. Photograph: \u00a9 De Fotomeisjes/De Fotomeisjes    Our final stop is at one of Amsterdam\u2019s most important underground dance music venues, Trouw. Filling a former newspaper printworks in the east of the city, the minimalist concrete rectangle is packed with a crowd who have come to see local Joris Voorn DJ tech-house all night long (literally), with label partner Edwin Oosterwal holding up the basement room. The blinds on the long windows are down and Voorn is hard at work behind the decks, almost lost in the sea of people dancing on the stage behind him. \u201cTrouw and ADE have made the biggest contribution to getting Amsterdam to take itself seriously as a clubbing city,\u201d says Marco. \u201cTrouw created a crowd, educated a crowd.\u201d The work was continued by ADE, which started in 1996 with 300 delegates and 30 DJs: \u201cPeople probably wouldn\u2019t have thought Amsterdam was a good setting for a dance music conference ... until ADE tried to do it.\u201d     Rooftop bar Canvas is a new addition to east Amsterdam\u2019s nightlife scene. Photograph: C Raymond van Mil/Canvas    But the clubbing landscape of Amsterdam is due to change: with the lease running out at the end of the year, Trouw is closing. After a final year spent turning up the intensity Berlin-style, bagging the city\u2019s first 24-hour licence, banning photographs in the club and ending pre-booked tickets on most of its nights, the club is going out with the \u201cabsolute climax\u201d its team wanted. Founder Olaf Boswijk is vague about the exact details but promises me there will be a follow-up. But after six years the club leaves behind a changed area; this summer the Volkshotel, with rooftop club Canvas, opened opposite, joining a number of new bars and restaurants around the Wibaustraat. And even the Trouw building, which will be turned into another hotel, may still retain its clubbing heritage under a new moniker. As a cold day begins to dawn, we head out of Trouw, leaving the crowd in the sound-infused time warp that makes the place so special. The night has jumped between vintage bars, Belgian pubs and underground clubs, and we\u2019ve mingled with students, professionals, tourists and ravers, but somehow it still feels cohesive. \u201cEverything\u2019s very mixed,\u201d says Marco, \u201cbut that\u2019s what Amsterdam represents \u2013 a mix of influences. The city is too small to have separate clubs for everyone. People have to interact with each other, and that\u2019s what creates an exciting dynamic.\u201d \u2022 Amsterdam Dance Event runs from 15-19 October.

The first pilot projects are due to start within a year on council estates and housing association properties in London, Birmingham and southern England and are set to save 1,950GWh of energy.  The Energiesprong (Energy Leap) initiative involves completely wrapping houses with insulated panel-facades that snap on like Lego. Insulated roofs adorned with 24 high-efficiency solar panels each are fastened on top, while heat pumps, hot water storage tanks and ventilation units are stored in garden sheds.  On the Woonwaard housing estate near Amsterdam, tenants whose homes have already received the upgrade say that the final effect is like living inside a \u2018tea cosy\u2019. \u201cThis new house is great,\u201d former social worker Astrid Andre, 58,told the Guardian. \u201cYou can\u2019t hear the traffic from outside anymore. It feels as if I\u2019m living in a private home, rather than social housing. Before, the wind used to go through the house in winter. I have arthritis and when the weather was colder, it became worse. But my bones are better now, more supple.\u201d     Former social worker Astrid Andre, who lives near Amsterdam, says that both noise and draft levels have improved since the retrofit.  Photograph: Arthur Neslen for The Guardian     The programme has already won a contract from the Dutch government to provide a wave of 10-day makeovers to 111,000 homes on estates mostly built in the 1960s and 70s. It is now bidding for \u20ac10m (\u00a37.8m) from the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 money pot to extend the project to the UK and France. Partners in the bid to bring the Dutch Energiesprongdevelopment team to the UK include the Greater London Authority (GLA), the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), The Housing Finance Corporation (THFC) and the National Federation of Housing Associations (NFHA). \u201cThe Netherlands has a head start but the basic logic is the same,\u201d said Jasper van den Munckhof, Energiesprong\u2019s director. \u201cIf you have political will, government support, and a housing association sector that can put up a strong volume for conceptual development, then there is a profitable case for builders to step in.\u201d      Materials used for wall isolation in renovated houses by Dutch Energiesprong in Arnhem. Photograph: Frank Hanswijk/Energiesprong       The deceptively simple idea behind the initiative has been to finance the roughly 300,000 mass-produced renovations from the estimated \u20ac6bn of savings from energy bills that they will make each year. In the Netherlands, upfront capital comes from the WSW social bank, which has provided \u20ac6bn to underwrite government-backed 40-year loans to housing associations. These then charge tenants the same amount they had previously paid for rent and energy bills together, until the debt is repaid.  The prefabricated refurbishments come with a 40-year builders\u2019 guarantee that covers the entire loan period, and a 5.25% return is guaranteed to participating housing associations.  But the renovations can only be done if all tenants in a block agree to it, and that spurred the invention of an unlikely environmental incentive: free bathrooms, fridges and Ikea kitchens, with electric cooking. \u201cEveryone has been talking about it since last December,\u201d said Bianca Lakeman, a 32-year-old office worker and single mother on the Woonwaard estate. \u201cThey\u2019re saying how the front facade is very modern but most of all they are talking about the beautiful Ikea kitchens.\u201d  Tenants can choose the kitchen\u2019s colour and design and, because the construction companies are contracted to provide maintenance for the next four decades, the new installations work out cheaper than the anticipated costs of servicing mid-20th century kitchens into the mid-21st century. \u201cWhen we started, there was a period where not everybody was keen,\u201d said Marnette Vroegop, a concept developer for the Woonwaard housing association. \u201cThe main doubts were about whether it was realistic.\u201d     Pierre Sponselee, director of Woonwaard housing association. Photograph: Arthur Neslen for The Guardian    \u201cThere is one block of six houses here and one person still says no,\u201d Pierre Sponselee, the association\u2019s director said. \u201cThe man had lived here only for a year and came from another house where he\u2019d had a renovation and he didn\u2019t want another one. It is a pity for the rest of the neighbours.\u201d  Minor complaints from tenants about the refurbishments have included noise from garden shed installations and increased awareness of internal house sounds, as floorboards become proportionately louder when outside noises are muffled.   Bianca\u2019s block is due to be renovated this month in the latest construction round on the estate that will see another 50 zero energy homes created. \u201cI\u2019m very excited about it because it can keep my cost of living under control and reduce the effects of climate change,\u201d she said.  Around 40% of Europe\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions come from heating and lighting in buildings and the EU has set a zero energy requirement for all new house builds by 2021. But these only make up around 1% of the continent\u2019s housing stock and how to persuade the construction industry to renovate to new and untried standards had been a vexed question.  With support from the Dutch government, Energiesprong dangled the carrot of secured long-term contracts for a market of up to 2.3m homes, and then asked a depressed construction sector what solutions they could come up with.     Energiesprong renovated building in Groningen. Photograph: Rogier Bos/Energiesprong     The result was the beginnings of a reindustrialisation of the Dutch building sector, with construction companies taking 3D scans of houses to offer factory-produced refurbishments tailored to each house\u2019s dimensions. \u201cWe have to think like a manufacturer,\u201d said Joost Nelis, the director of BAM, the Netherlands\u2019 biggest construction company. \u201cWe want to shrink the garden power units like Apple did the iPad,\u201d Nelis says.  The company is also experimenting with apartment blocks run on DC electricity, which increases solar panel efficiency by about 30%. Almost all buildings in the Netherlands run on AC, but few tower blocks have room for enough solar panels to generate electricity for more than five floors of homes.  While trade unions have enthusiastically signed up to Energiesprong, energy companies that use fossil fuels could lose out on the gathering transformation, according to Nelis. Tenants in places such as Woonwaard can already sell their excess electricity back to the grid and may one day be able to use electric cars to power their homes.  Ambitious though it is, Energiesprong says its programme of building renovations should be seen as a means to a low-carbon transformation of the building sector, rather than an end in itself.  Last week, a similar deal was signed with the Netherlands biggest mortgage banks, real estate surveyors and government, to take the project into the private sector too.", "sentences": ["On the Woonwaard housing estate near Amsterdam, tenants whose homes have already received the upgrade say that the final effect is like living inside a \u2018tea cosy\u2019.", "But my bones are better now, more supple.\u201d     Former social worker Astrid Andre, who lives near Amsterdam, says that both noise and draft levels have improved since the retrofit."], "title": "Ikea kitchens help sell insulation to Dutch \u2013 and UK could be next", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/10/uk-looks-to-dutch-model-to-make-100000-homes-carbon-neutral-by-2020", "tags": ["Energy efficiency", "Energy bills", "Home improvements", "Energy", "Ethical and green living", "Consumer affairs", "Property", "Environment", "Netherlands", "Household bills", "Europe", "UK news", "Green building", "Social housing"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-10-10T13:00:07Z", "article": "The philosophy behind Washington DC\u2019s homeless newspaper, Street Sense, is a good one: empower homeless individuals to advocate for themselves and generate income by selling a newspaper about homelessness. After 11 years, Street Sense vendors have become an institution in the nation\u2019s capital, calling out their slogan: \u201cHelp the homeless help themselves by supporting Street Sense.\u201d  And Street Sense is only one of a plethora of papers with similar models. In the UK, there\u2019s The Big Issue, and in New York, there\u2019s Street News. In San Francisco, homeless people sell Street Sheet and in Nashville, they sell The Contributor. Across the world, these papers provide non-panhandling income for the homeless \u2013 and information on the homeless community for a larger audience. The problem is that few people want to spend $2 for a newspaper that they\u2019re not interested in reading. To some extent, this isn\u2019t just a problem for the homeless: print journalism everywhere is a declining business.  Beyond that, though, there\u2019s the environmental impact \u2013 and the fact that street papers encourage the printing of material that will likely end up unread and in a recycling bin. In a larger sense, a Street Sense vendor is, essentially, a panhandler with a prop, much like the scores of environmental canvassers who also regularly accost urban pedestrians.  It\u2019s time to rethink the Street Sense model, so that homeless people can provide useful services to the populace of DC \u2013 ideally, in a way that can be replicated in other cities. I propose that we invite homeless people to join another group: Herd (Homeless Enforcers of Responsible Driving).  Herd members would be dispatched to dangerous intersections, where red-light running, speeding, or box blocking is frequent and no traffic cameras have yet been installed. From their posts, they could then use city-issued smartphones to take pictures and videos and transmit them to the police or to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Red-light running is a serious \u2013 and expensive \u2013 problem, injuring an estimated 133,000 people a year in the US. Infractions cost the country billions of dollars in property damage, medical bills and lost productivity. Admittedly, traffic cameras have proven a useful and cost-effective solution. One estimate, in fact, found that each system, which costs an estimated $67,000-$80,000, saves $39,000-$50,000 per year in costs. But the upfront cost of Herd would be even less expensive than cameras: it would consist of little more than cheap smartphones, uniforms, training and management.  What\u2019s more, unlike most traffic cameras, Herd could be mobile, so bad driving could be targeted wherever it crops up, not just on specific street corners. This initiative could provide a solid livelihood for hundreds of homeless residents \u2013 either a livable hourly wage or a fee for each verified violation. If Herd members worked hard, they could earn enough to become housed, tax-paying residents \u2013 another plus compared to cameras, which don\u2019t pay taxes or support the economy. Best of all, Herd members would command deeper respect than the homeless do today. Imagine homeless people in red Herd shirts standing at street corners around the city, a warning to reckless drivers and a vivid reminder to pedestrians that they need not fear being run over. And while this respect might be tinged with fear, as often is the case with the police, it would be far healthier than the gaze-averting, \u201cpretend they\u2019re not there\u201d relationship most of us now have with the homeless.  My bet is that Herd would be a quickly profitable investment, generating significant revenue from egocentric drivers while also reducing accidents, the cost of police time to deal with minor traffic problems, and the myriad costs of homelessness to the city. It\u2019s an all-around win, and seems like a natural way to provide good jobs to the most entrepreneurial of the homeless populations found in any of the other 530 US towns and cities that already use red-light cameras.  There is also a precedent for Herd: many US communities already include volunteers in their police and fire departments, in part to help keep up with expanding responsibilities as city budgets get cut. Some cities, like New York, even have Auxiliary Police \u2013 uniformed volunteers who \u201cobserve and report\u201d crimes and through their presence help to deter crime.  More recently, Amsterdam has even been experimenting with employing alcoholics in street cleaning crews and paying them partly in beer, while also providing a basic living stipend and a controlled environment where their drinking problems can be managed. Surely, other cities can learn from these efforts and apply them to traffic enforcement. If so, Herd could offer a cost-effective, profitable way to keep the city safe for drivers and pedestrians alike.  Who knows? This type of innovation could even trigger all sorts of economic and job opportunities for homeless and chronically unemployed populations. Fruit and vegetable sellers setting up small stands in urban food deserts? Microlibrarians popping up with book carts at metro and bus stops? How about \u201cbicycle-sharing relocation specialists\u201d moving shared bikes to empty kiosks, reducing the need for fossil-fuel-burning vans?  There are nearly unlimited ways we could better provide services \u2013 even in profitable ways \u2013 while creating new microenterprise opportunities for those in need. And in the process, we\u2019d provide an opportunity for the homeless not just to help themselves, but to help others as well.  The social impact hub is funded by Anglo American.

The government will be led by Charles Michel, 38, the country\u2019s youngest prime minister since 1841 and a scion of a liberal political family. His MR party is the only French-speaking one in a precarious coalition with three Flemish parties. The imbalance appears to be made greater still by the presence in government for the first time of the separatist Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie (N-VA). The others are the Flemish Christian democrat CD&amp;V and the Flemish liberal Open VLD. The tensions are likely to be further strained when the coalition attempts to roll out radical economic and social reforms. The main task will be to balance the budget: at just over 100% of GDP, Belgium\u2019s net debt is one of the highest in the eurozone. As well as lowering taxes, the new government plans to raise the pension age from 65 to 67 in 2030, and tighten immigration and asylum rules. The proposals, contained in a 207-page coalition programme, have already triggered protests from Belgium\u2019s socialist parties and trade unions. Marc Goblet, the secretary general of the country\u2019s second biggest union, ABVV/FGTB, has talked of a \u201cpermanent guerrilla campaign\u201d against the coalition. The French-speaking socialist PS party of the outgoing prime minister, Elio Di Rupo, said the plans \u201cwill hit citizens hard, they\u2019ll work more to earn less\u201d. It has also been critical of Michel, who said in the runup to last May\u2019s elections that he would never partner with the N-VA. Philippe Van Parijs, a politics professor at the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, said strikes and other industrial actions were inevitable. \u201cThe main problem of the government will be less the relationship of the language communities and more the relationship with the trade unions,\u201d he said. Michel\u2019s MR party came third in the May elections, with 9.3% of the vote, winning 20 out of 150 parliamentary seats. The N-VA was the largest party with 20.4% and 33 seats, but no Francophone party was ready to work in an administration headed by the separatists. N-VA\u2019s leader, Bart De Wever, will remain mayor of Antwerp and not join the coalition. The 14-strong cabinet has by law to be split evenly between French and Flemish speakers, giving MR seven ministers, with party stalwart Didier Reynders staying on as Foreign Minister. On the Flemish side, N-VA grabbed three key ministerial positions with finance, defence and the interior, while the CD&amp;V gets the justice ministry and Open VLD has social affairs. Michel has enjoyed a rapid rise to power in the shadow of his father, Louis Michel, a former foreign minister and European commissioner.

Elected to provincial council at 18, and to the Belgian parliament at 23, Michel became a minister in the Walloon government at 24, and joined the federal government for the first time in 2007, when he became development aid minister. He is also the mayor of the nearby town of Wavre. Michel will be the first prime minister appointed by King Philippe, who ascended to the throne in July last year. Although he is only Belgium\u2019s second French-speaking prime minister in 40 years, Michel can claim impressive cross-cultural credentials: the Michel family has roots in Hoegaarden, the Flemish town famed for its wheat beer. And his family\u2019s political stronghold is Jodoigne, just over a mile from the line between Wallonia and Flanders. Still, the auguries are not in his favour.

On one side stands Boris Johnson and his ambitious plans for a pair of cross-London cycling routes. Against him line up business groups who, critics say, appear more worried about the traffic flow of limousines than safer bike lanes. Plans for two cycling superhighways through London\u2019s centre \u2013 a three-mile north-south route and a more ambitious 18-mile stretch running west to east \u2013 were outlined last year, with detailed plans unveiled in September. Proponents argue the planned routes, which would keep riders almost entirely segregated from motor traffic, could spark a transport revolution in the capital and provide a template for cities nationwide. Critics respond that Johnson and his cycling \u201ctsar\u201d, the journalist-turned advisor Andrew Gilligan, are rushing through plans that could gridlock the capital. The tussle is bitter and complex. The bitterness comes amid allegations about anonymous briefings and private lobbying from corporations that supporters of the scheme claim are intent on derailing or at least delaying the plans. The Canary Wharf group, which manages the high-rise business estate to the east of the City, has been foremost among opponents, distributing an anonymous briefing paper that called the planned east-west highway \u201cextremely damaging to London\u201d, saying it would cut traffic lanes from four to two. Critics say the latter claim is especially misleading given this would happen for only a few hundred metres of the 18-mile route.     A stretch of the proposed 18-mile east-west cycle superhighway is set to pass through the Canary Wharf financial district in east London. Photograph: ANDY RAIN/EPA    Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cycling champion who is now a policy adviser to British cycling, said the Canary Wharf company had engaged in heavy lobbying to derail the scheme but appeared afraid to go public. \u201cThey know that they will be seen as old men in limos,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThey know that most Londoners, who do not drive in the centre, sympathise with making central London less car-dominated. So instead, they are trying to poison the project in secret without leaving any fingerprints.\u201d Canary Wharf has subsequently confirmed it was behind the anonymous briefing, though insists it supports the plans in principle. However, a spokesman said the company, along with many other businesses, remained \u201cextremely concerned about the design and traffic impact of the current proposals\u201d. The paradox is that while much of the fuss has centred around the opposition, wider business opinion seems to be quietly moving behind the scheme. The Corporation of London, which governs the City, through which the east-west route would pass, initially expressed significant scepticism. However, now Transport for London (TfL) has published detailed models of the predicted traffic effect of the lanes its stance appears to have softened.     A cyclist on Westminster Bridge in central London. Photograph: J Bewley/Sustrans    Michael Welbank, the corporation\u2019s head of planning, said he was hopeful the City could end up backing the bulk of the east-west route, even if it remains sceptical about Johnson\u2019s ambition for them to open before he leaves office in 2016. \u201cWe are not opposed to the concept \u2013 the devil is in the detail,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve expressed reservations doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be worked out. At the moment we see no reasons why 90% or so shouldn\u2019t turn out to be resolveable.\u201d More significant still is the very public backing for the bike network offered in recent weeks by a series of major employers, among them RBS, Orange and Unilever, with more big names expected to come out next week. The latter corporation, which is Anglo-Dutch, was at pains to stress that its other headquarters, in Rotterdam, is surrounded by safe lanes and it wanted London to follow suit as quickly as possible. Danny Williams, who runs the influential Cyclists in the City blog and has followed the debate closely, says this a hugely significant moment: \u201cThese are big employers, where a significant proportion of the people who work for them come to work on a bicycle. They\u2019re seeing the way the future is going. They know London needs infrastructure so people can get to work safely on a bike the same way they can expect to get to work safely on the tube or the train.\u201d Others say critics of the scheme are at risk of being seen as living in the past. Michael Liebreich, an entrepreneur who is a member of the TfL board, who has criticised private lobbying against the scheme, said there was \u201ca historic shift\u201d taking place. He said: \u201cCities are realising they have to compete on the quality of life they can offer to a young, mobile workforce. \u201cIf you\u2019re a games designer or a programmer, you could go to Berlin, you could go to Barcelona, you could go to Bogota, and you would have a fabulous lifestyle.

His Bath side are riding high and sunshine bathes the spectacular 18th-century mansion he has transformed into the most striking training base in sport. Three years after secretly registering the \u201cChampions Cup\u201d as the putative title of a new club-run European tournament, the latest phase of his oval-shaped vision starts next week. Lay a white cat on his lap and he could be a Bond character eyeing world domination. That is pretty much how some perceive him anyway. Sitting in his tasteful study overlooking the front lawns of his stately home-turned-training ground it is obvious that thinking big has never been Craig\u2019s problem. His views on how professional rugby union is heading in the next 10 or 20 years \u2013 \u201cWe haven\u2019t even started yet\u201d \u2013 are unashamedly ambitious. A global calendar, International Rugby Board \u201cself-interest\u201d: he still has many more battles to fight. Shining white knight or hard-nosed multimillionaire? Either way, he tends to get what he wants. But first the figures. Those who faced down the old Heineken Cup\u2019s organisers believe they have been vindicated before a ball is even kicked in the new European Champions Cup. Already fresh television deals for the revised 20-team tournament will yield \u20ac57m annually for the next four years. \u201cThe entire revenue of ERC was \u20ac47m,\u201d Craig says. \u201cWe\u2019ve just achieved an increase of 60% on TV rights alone. In four years\u2019 time our overall turnover will exceed \u20ac100m per year. I don\u2019t think, I know. When we say we\u2019re going to do something, we do it.\u201d In other words, Craig believes everyone will benefit from the recast competition, particularly once the five main partner sponsors \u2013 currently only Heineken have climbed aboard \u2013 are signed up. Each is being asked to pay around \u20ac4m, with the Rugby Football Union having guaranteed \u20ac5m to stage this season\u2019s final. Within 12 months, predicts Craig, annual revenue will have topped \u20ac80m with international television rights still to be fully maximised. Not everyone in rugby will applaud, arguing such progress comes at the price of marginalising less affluent teams and regions and makes life harder, for example, for the Irish provinces. Craig \u2013 who made his money in pharmaceutical logistics \u2013 sheds precious few tears: \u201cThe Irish are very pragmatic. They realised what they\u2019d had couldn\u2019t last for ever. If they\u2019d have been on the other side they\u2019d have been raising blue hell.\u201d But what about Wales and Scotland, or the less wealthy English clubs? Won\u2019t they be priced out of the increasingly shiny-shoed, meritocratic professional game? Craig insists not. \u201cIt\u2019s not like an oil sheikh or an oligarch coming in and saying: \u2018Well, the salary cap is now going to be \u00a3150m.\u2019 When that happens the whole thing goes to pot. I think there\u2019s natural evolution in everything. Look at the Orrells and Richmonds in English rugby. Things change. Look at the old French powerhouses: B\u00e9ziers, Colomiers, Dax, Pau, Agen \u2026 professional rugby has changed all that. Club competitions might become more global.\u201d The French-speaking Craig also argues the whole professional club game would have fallen in on itself had his two-year quest for fiscal freedom failed. \u201cWe would certainly not have continued playing. There just wasn\u2019t a viable future for what we are doing.\u201d Bath currently lose \u00a32-3m per year; Craig reckons they could break even in two years\u2019 time now their share of the Euro gateau is bigger. He is visibly proud to have taken on France\u2019s rugby politicians in their own powerful salons and won. \u201cIf you look at who controlled European rugby for the last 10 years it was actually the French. I waged that war against the French and they always thought I didn\u2019t have a chance. They didn\u2019t realise that, for me, this was the most important thing. When I look at the self-interest in some of the unions and the administrative structures of the IRB I just think it\u2019s a real shame. They\u2019re protecting their own interests, not looking at what\u2019s best for rugby.\u201d That victory has cleared the way for his next priority: the global calendar. Craig is adamant Test and club rugby will not be played in tandem beyond 2019 when the current international schedule agreement expires. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a matter of us being dictated to and told when, where and how [we can play]. The English and French leagues will have to be consulted because the players are contracted to the clubs.\u201d For the global season, Craig\u2019s solution is straightforward. The Six Nations stays where it is, followed by Premiership and European club games from mid-March to early October. The June Test window would disappear, with Test rugby in both hemispheres occurring in late October and November. Summer rugby? Typically, Craig regards that \u201csacred cow\u201d as ripe for slaughter and has similarly radical views on how to protect his players from injury. \u201cYou could actually play more games by increasing the size of match-day squads to 32 players rather than 23. If players are on the field for fewer minutes they wouldn\u2019t absorb as much punishment as they do today. If you do that you could play two games per week. That would allow you to condense the season. We already have a squad of 50 so the wage bill would stay the same. It\u2019s a different way of looking at it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Craig\u2019s efforts to upscale the professional game do not end there. A Bath sevens team competing in Hong Kong and European finals staged in Amsterdam or Barcelona within two or three years are other bubbling ideas. Soon enough, he thinks, the gap between the grandest French and English clubs may even start to reverse. Critics of the decision allowing Premiership clubs to sign a big overseas name outside the salary cap are, he feels, being short-sighted. \u201cI don\u2019t want an inordinate number of foreign players coming into England. But if we could get a Quade Cooper, a James O\u2019Connor, a Duane Vermeulen, a Richie McCaw and a Dan Carter into the Premiership it would just add huge excitement and make the English game stronger.\u201d Next week\u2019s new European dawn, in short, really is just the start. As the sun pours through his study windows, bathing the master of the house in its golden rays, Bruce Almighty admits he will experience a similar inner glow when Harlequins and Castres kick off next Friday. \u201cIn 15 to 20 years, 50,000 people might want to watch Bath every weekend. Who knows? There might be different views on what\u2019s best for rugby but history will show that what we\u2019ve got now is far superior to what we had. I think we\u2019ll see, once the rugby starts, how much stronger it\u2019s going to be.\u201d", "sentences": ["A Bath sevens team competing in Hong Kong and European finals staged in Amsterdam or Barcelona within two or three years are other bubbling ideas."], "title": "Champions Cup is just the start for ambitious Bath owner Bruce Craig", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/10/champions-cupbruce-craig-bath-european-club-tournament", "tags": ["Bath", "Rugby union", "European Rugby Champions Cup", "Premiership", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-10-10T18:34:33Z", "article": "Posters aimed at raising awareness of Ebola are to be put up at larger British airports, according to internal advice sent out to all UK Border Force staff following the government\u2019s U-turn on screening for the disease on entry to the country . With just over a week to go before the first direct flight to the UK from West Africa for two months, the posters referred to in the Border Force memo \u2013 which the Guardian has seen \u2013 were among the few concrete details to emerge about the government\u2019s strategy, amid claims from some experts that screening is a waste of time. A message marked \u201csensitive\u201d sent out to staff by Marc Owen, the Border Force\u2019s acting chief operating officer, said that the large outbreak of Ebola in west Africa was \u201cunderstandably\u201d causing staff some concern regarding the risk from infected passengers, but reassured them that the threat as currently assessed by health authorities was \u201cvery low\u201d. He said the government planned to put up awareness posters at larger UK airports and ports to raise awareness of the disease among passengers arriving into the UK. The posters will advise them what symptoms they should look out for and what to do should they develop these symptoms. The message was accompanied by a Q&amp;A, with questions such as \u201cWhat should I do if someone collapses in front of me at control?\u201d and \u201cShould I use latex gloves?\u201d The answers were that it was highly unlikely someone ill enough to collapse would have been travelling in the first place, and that alcohol hand gel was more effective than latex gloves. The prime minister yesterday defended the decision to introduce enhanced screening for Ebola at Heathrow and Gatwick, and at Eurostar terminals. \u201cWhat we do is listen to the medical advice and we act on that advice, and that\u2019s why we are introducing the screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports,\u201d David Cameron said. According to Downing Street, which was yet to issue further details last night, the screening will involve assessing passengers\u2019 recent travel history, contacts and onward travel arrangements, as well as a possible medical assessment conducted by trained medical personnel. Most travellers at airports are not expected to encounter the measures as they are intended to target arrivals from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the countries at the centre of the Ebola outbreak, which has killed more than 4,000 people since December. Nevertheless, Labour MP Keith Vaz said a lack of precise information available about screening was \u201cshambolic\u201d following confusion over whether the government would introduce the measures at all. David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, called the screening a \u201ccomplete waste of time\u201d. \u201cAre they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam? That would lead to a lot of delays and disruption. Secondly, why would anyone admit that they have been in contact with someone when they\u2019re in a hurry to get through immigration control when they arrive at the airport?\u201d There was also criticism from the World Health Organisation\u2019s director of strategy, Chris Dye, who said it was unlikely the scheme would detect anyone with Ebola. \u201cThe chances of someone with Ebola turning up in the UK is relatively small,\u201d he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. Professor George Griffin, chair of the government\u2019s advisory committee on dangerous pathogens, described the planned tests as \u201ca very, very blunt instrument\u201d and added that he was surprised that screening was being introduced after being led to believe it would not be. Staff working at airports are meanwhile divided about the plans. While the Immigration Services Union, which representing 5,000 border staff, has been sharply critical of the announcement, others have been quietly supportive of the government\u2019s plans. Sian Griffiths, former president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, said screening was \u201cnot the solution but it\u2019s is part of the panoply of tools you need to work with\u201d. She worked on the Sars outbreak in Asia more than 10 years ago and said effective screening would raise general awareness about infectious diseases. In 2002 and 2003 all airlines in the Sars-affected countries issued forms to airlines obliging passengers to say who they had been in touch with in the event of a positive test post arrival. Passengers were also required to walk through heat sensitive camera gates which checked temperatures. \u201cIt involved millions of passengers. Everybody was screened. Even if you crossed the bridge from Hong Kong to China you have to fill in a form. It is a big effort, but people\u2019s reaction to infectious disease is all about judgment and risk, \u201c she said, recalling how Asians are now more naturally open to precautions such as constant washing of hands as a result of Sars.", "sentences": ["\u201cAre they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam?"], "title": "Ebola awareness strategy to include posters at UK airports", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/10/ebola-awareness-posters-uk-airports-screening", "tags": ["Ebola", "UK news", "World news", "Air transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-10-11T19:45:52Z", "article": "The first Ebola cases will soon emerge in the UK according to the government\u2019s chief medical officer, who said the country should expect \u201ca handful\u201d of people to fall ill with the disease in coming months. Dame Sally Davies issued her warning on Saturday following a national exercise to test Britain\u2019s readiness for an Ebola outbreak amid growing criticism that government priorities for dealing with the threat are seriously misplaced. Davies said: \u201cIt will not be surprising if we have spillover into this country so I would expect a handful of cases in the next few months. This vitally important exercise gave a very realistic test of how prepared the system is to deal with a case of Ebola. Today has included a variety of scenarios involving personnel from hospitals, ambulance services and local authorities around the country.\u201d Despite the predicted spread, Dr David Nabarro, the UN\u2019s senior system coordinator for Ebola, told the BBC\u2019s Up All Night on Sunday morning that he believed the disease would be \u201cunder control\u201d in three months. While the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, announced \u2013 after chairing a simulated meeting of the emergency Cobra committee as part of the UK\u2019s test \u2013 that the exercise had been reassuring and \u201cextremely useful\u201d, other politicians and scientists described government plans as futile. The eight-hour exercise involved actors simulating symptoms of Ebola with one person \u201ccollapsing\u201d in a Gateshead shopping centre and being placed in isolation at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne, and was held as a preamble to the introduction of screening for the virus at large airports and terminals. But many experts have voiced serious misgivings about the introduction of screening, ordered by David Cameron as part of the UK\u2019s contingency plan against Ebola, which has killed more than 4,000 people in west Africa. Professor David Mabey, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said screening would be futile. \u201cThere won\u2019t be anyone coming from these [west African] countries because all direct flights have been cancelled,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam? That would lead to a lot of delays and disruption.\u201d This point was supported by virologist Dr Ben Neuman of Reading University, who said there was no \u201cstrong scientific case that airport screening will help keep Ebola out of the UK\u201d. Professor Tom Solomon, Liverpool University\u2019s head of infection and global health, said evidence \u201csuggests such measures won\u2019t make a large difference\u201d. An even more trenchant criticism of the government\u2019s emphasis on spotting Ebola victims as they entered Britain was provided from Sierra Leone by Andrew Gleadle, programme director for the International Medical Corps. \u201cI\u2019d like to see is a little less hysteria in the US and the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may get a few isolated cases [in the west] but we\u2019re not going to get an epidemic. We need more focus on west Africa, where the real problem is.\u201d Children\u2019s charity Plan UK, said the only \u201ctruly effective\u201d way of preventing Ebola reaching Britain was to tackle the crisis in west Africa. \u201cAs the government introduces more measures to try to prevent the arrival of Ebola in this country, it would be fatal to forget that the best way to help the UK is to help west Africa,\u201d said chief executive Tanya Barron. \u201cThis is an outbreak that needs tackling at source, and to change the course of the crisis, we mustn\u2019t simply hunker down in developed nations. We must break the chain of infection.\u201d Others raised doubts about the arrangements for screening at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar rail terminals. A spokesman for Gatwick said the airport had not received any instructions on how screening should be carried out. Labour MP Keith Vaz said a lack of precise information available about the screening was \u201cshambolic\u201d. The US has begun screening travellers from the three west African countries most affected by Ebola infections \u2013 Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea \u2013 at JFK airport in New York and was expecting to expand this to Newark Liberty, Washington Dulles, Chicago O\u2019Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta later this week. It was also confirmed that more than 750 UK military personnel and the medical ship RFA Argus were being sent to west Africa to help in the efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak. \u201cWhat we are focusing on as a country is taking action right across the board to deal with this problem at source,\u201d the prime minister said on Saturday. \u201cWhat we do is listen to the medical advice and we act on that advice, and that\u2019s why we are introducing the screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports.\u201d Meanwhile, doctors in Macedonia have ruled out the Ebola virus as the cause of death of a British man in the Balkan country on Thursday. \u201cWe have just received the results from the lab in Hamburg and they are negative for Ebola, which means that the patient did not have the Ebola virus,\u201d said Dr Jovanka Kostovska of the Macedonian health ministry\u2019s commission for infectious diseases.", "sentences": ["\u201cAre they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam?"], "title": "Britain warned to expect \u2018a handful\u2019 of Ebola cases in coming months", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/11/ebola-checks-uk-airports-waste-of-time", "tags": ["Ebola", "World news", "UK news", "Health", "Society", "Health policy", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-10-12T19:34:27Z", "article": "Rembrandt is so high in the ranking of great artists that our amassed reverence has sunk like syrup into the brown and gold surfaces of his paintings. There he is in the first room of this startling exhibition, gazing back from his self-portraits, a sage and infinitely gentle soul: Rembrandt the master. Then the curators pull a hidden lever and the floor disappears. This brilliant, brave blockbuster reveals the true Rembrandt \u2013 a man at the end of his tether. It is a shocking and cathartic journey through the tragedy of his fall. By exposing that, it reveals his ultimate triumph. It is like seeing a great actor play King Lear and Prospero as a double bill. In the second room hangs one of Rembrandt\u2019s most bizarre and disturbing works, The Conspiracy of the Batavians under Claudius Civilis. This mad history painting was commissioned in 1660 for Amsterdam town hall. Rembrandt was one of several artists hired to decorate its interior with noble scenes glorifying the Dutch republic.     Rembrandt\u2019s The Conspiracy of the Batavians under Claudius Civilis. Photograph: The Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Sweden    He portrayed the rebellion of the ancient Batavians, a favourite patriotic legend of a republic that had recently freed itself from Spain. But he changed it into an image of madness and desolation. Tradition had it that the rebel leader Claudius Civilis had only one eye. Instead of concealing or ennobling this lack as a conventional history painting might, Rembrandt homed in on it with morbid fascination. The empty eye socket of Claudius Civilis becomes the focal point of this painting of blind faith and blind courage \u2013 a desperate, scary drama of suicidal heroism. This vision of extreme, amoral bravery with its dark suggestion that war, freedom and nation are empty myths was quickly taken down from the town hall. The censorship of one of his most ambitious paintings was a further humiliation for Rembrandt. For the man we meet here was a failure. In the 1650s, in his mid 40s, Rembrandt went bankrupt. He had to sell all the jewels and art he had collected in his wealthy years. The luscious gold-spun clothes and jewellery in his 1665 masterpiece The Jewish Bride, one of this exhibition\u2019s most incandescent marvels, are imaginary replacements for the material possessions he lost.     Rembrandt\u2019s The Jewish Bride, oil on canvas (circa 1665-1669). Photograph: Alamy    As a bankrupt he depended on his son Titus and his housekeeper and lover Hendrickje Stoffels to do business on his behalf. For her pains, Stoffels was excommunicated from church for \u201cpractising whoredom with the painter Rembrandt\u201d. Love and sex are among the great themes of Rembrandt\u2019s late art, as he insists on the beauty of the human stuff Christianity condemned. In one erotic etching he portrays a black woman naked. He loves her difference. But his most frequent model was Stoffels, who poses for him stepping into a stream or as the Roman heroine Lucretia choosing death over shame. These portraits are both sexual and full of pathos. He wants to show the world \u2013 show history, show us \u2013 that she is no \u201cwhore\u201d but his dignified and serious beloved. She poses most poignantly as Bathsheba, who in the Old Testament was summoned to sleep with King David, simply because he wished it. A servant washes Bathsheba\u2019s feet while she sits gravely meditating on David\u2019s letter. Rembrandt hails the grandeur of her nakedness \u2013 and her sorrow, as she endures the burden of a king\u2019s desire.     Rembrandt\u2019s The Syndics (1662). Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam Photograph: Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam    So many sorrows, so many souls. They look at you from Rembrandt\u2019s great group portrait, The Syndics (1662) \u2013 faces that suddenly seem alive and self-conscious, returning the beholder\u2019s gaze with a kind of intimate pity. We are all in this together, they sadly, silently say. Rembrandt\u2019s compassionate drawings of a young woman hanging from a gibbet are among the show\u2019s many shocks. She and the Syndics \u2013 even though the girl is an outcast, an executed criminal, and the Syndics are pillars of Amsterdam society \u2013 are somehow the same. For they and we are headed to the same undiscovered country as the horribly cut-up corpse that Rembrandt portrays with eerie attentiveness in The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Joan Deyman. A student holds the sawn off top of the dead man\u2019s skull, as if it were a cup. The exposed brain is a labyrinth of pink goo. Rembrandt learned so much from his failures, his humiliations. He learned that we are all equal. The shadows of death gather around us like the black ink that overwhelms his etching of the crucifixion \u2013 but we can be heroes in love, in truth.

After recent weakness due to competition concerns, the privatised operator added 7.5p to 407.4p in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s sale of its Paddington site to property group Great Western Developments for \u00a3111m in cash with another \u00a320m due if planning permission is granted. The price was higher than analysts\u2019 estimates, and reinforced the view that Royal Mail had undervalued assets on its books. In a buy note Matthew O\u2019Keeffe at Berenberg said:  At the full amount, this is 85% above our own valuation for Paddington at \u00a371m. Pre-planning permission, it is 56% ahead of our valuation. A key element of our buy case for Royal Mail is predicated on the company selling three major sites in London that it has \u201crecognised as surplus\u201d. These sites are in Paddington, Nine Elms and Mount Pleasant. These sites have been the subject of speculation among property investors, with estimates ranging from \u00a3250m to \u00a3500m for the three sites compared to our estimate of \u00a31bn. The Paddington sale demonstrates the potential undervaluation of these sites and supports our buy case. The bulk of the value comes from Nine Elms, which is a 14-acre site that we value at \u00a3662m. Mount Pleasant is also significant at over eight acres; our estimated value is \u00a3267m for the site. While we understand that Paddington will carry a premium to either of the other locations, they are nonetheless in central London and we would expect that Royal Mail will be able to sell these sites for at least our estimate. If we were to assume a 30% premium for each of the other two sites, it would add another \u00a3387m to our already-above-consensus estimates. We continue to view Royal Mail as the best play in the logistics space despite recent and ongoing margin concerns. We believe that these margin concerns will ultimately prove to be overdone and that Royal Mail, like its peers previously, will enjoy a sustained period of cost reductions having shifted from being a government-owned business to one that is listed. This potential for operational outperformance, together with the prospect of better than expected sale proceeds, drives our \u00a37 price target and buy recommendation.  But Credit Suisse was less optimistic:  Whilst the sale of the Paddington asset was unexpected with only a year having passed since the IPO, two sites remain within the portfolio of significantly higher complexity to dispose of. We remain underperform on Royal Mail driven by concerns over UK parcel trends, growing competition in domestic mail and sustained margin pressure at [Amsterdam based] General Logistics Systems. We expect consensus to continue to drift and see risk to 2015 Royal Mail guidance.  Overall though another bout of poor data - US retail sales, producer prices and weak Chinese inflation figures - confirmed recent concerns about a global economic slowdown, sending the FTSE 100 181.04 points lower to 6211.64, its biggest daily fall and worst level since June 2013. Added to that were growing worries about further political turmoil in Greece, anxiety ahead of the results of the latest European bank stress tests, as well as uncertainty over the situation in the Middle East and the spread of the Ebola virus. Heathcare shares came under pressure on suggestions that US group AbbVie may abandon its bid for Shire, down \u00a311.28 at \u00a340.12, with the US government threatening to clamp down on the tax benefits of relocating to Europe. Other possible US targets were also weaker, with AstraZeneca 141p lower at 4264.5p and Smith and Nephew dropping 52.5p to 921.5p.

It\u2019s not your usual busload, though. This group has come from Texas for a weekend organised by Spiro, a luxury cannabis tour operator, and its package includes a visit to a spa, dinner, a trip to a farm and a weed-infused cooking class. Some of them will buy and smoke, some are just curious, but they\u2019re all here for the pot. Until now choices for pot tourism have been limited. There\u2019s Amsterdam, of course, where tourists can buy up to five grams and smoke in coffee shops, but this year in the US, since Washington state and Colorado legalised personal recreational purchasing and consumption of marijuana, there\u2019s been a rush to open dispensaries and growing operations, particularly in Denver. Medicinal marijuana has been available in Colorado since 2000, so many existing suppliers are investing in more plants, space, shops and staff. There are, as yet, no Starbucks-style chains though; many of the dispensaries (selling everything from ready-rolled joints to smoking paraphernalia) are small and independently owned. Drawn by the mountains and the laid-back atmosphere, tourists arrive daily in Colorado from other US states and, increasingly, from overseas. Buying cannabis is the easy part; smoking it is another story, as Colorado also has tough anti-smoking laws. Whether in edible or smokeable form, marijuana use is prohibited in public spaces, including streets and parks, and in places visible from public spaces (such as your hotel balcony). You can smoke inside at clubs such as Studio A64 in Colorado Springs, and a new wave of hotels allow smoking (of tobacco or weed) in 25% of the rooms.     Cannabis-infused trail mix is put in containers for participants in a cannabis cooking class in Denver.  Photograph: Alamy    Since the beginning of 2014, it is estimated that cannabis sales have brought Colorado $47m in tax revenue, with an estimated third of those sales to customers from out of state. From resorts in western Colorado, such as Aspen, to the university town of Boulder, new dispensaries are opening to take advantage of those looking for a more-refined buying experience. They tend to look like luxury fashion boutiques, with no tie-dye or Bob Marley shirts in sight.

When I meet the former Sonic Youth frontman for lunch in a noisy London restaurant, I politely ask how he\u2019s finding life since he moved from Connecticut to Stoke Newington, north London last year. I begin to fear I will never get to ask a second question. His encyclopaedic response takes in the differences between US and UK punk; the gentrification of Lower Manhattan; the importance of Patti Smith (\u201cthe model for all of us\u201d); the British \u201canxiety towards impropriety\u201d; and the neglected counter-cultural history of his new neighbourhood. \u201cThat history has been deleted, for the most part, from the streets of Stoke Newington,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hidden behind all these young marrieds with prams in boutiques. You should know where you live. I find that to be a certain responsibility.\u201d Moore\u2019s enthusiasm, pouring out of his strangely unlined face beneath a boyish shock of hair, makes him seem much younger than 56. He has an infectious let\u2019s-do-the-show-right-here vibe that explains why he\u2019s been able to work with everyone from Neil Young and Yoko Ono to REM and John Zorn. In the 1980s and 90s, some bands owed their record deals to Moore\u2019s cheerleading. \u201cHe exuded this faith,\u201d his former wife and bandmate Kim Gordon once said about the man she met in 1980. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really worry about the future.\u201d He still doesn\u2019t, even though the future is more uncertain than ever. In 2011, it was announced that he and Gordon were divorcing, which inevitably meant an indefinite hiatus for Sonic Youth. \u201cThe suspension of the band was enforced by our marriage dissolving,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are very few bands where people work together and live together. Nothing about it was pretty. At all. It\u2019s really intense and heavy on both sides.\u201d     Thurston Moore, far left, Lee Ranaldo, Steve Shelley and Kim Gordon in Sonic Youth, Amsterdam, 1986. Photograph: Frans Schellekens/Redferns    It feels strange discussing the split with Moore because I interviewed Gordon earlier this year, but it\u2019s fruitless, not to mention grubby, to take sides. Other people\u2019s marriages are a mystery. Gossip sites, however, thought differently, revealing the identity of Moore\u2019s new girlfriend, book editor Eva Prinz, and blaming him for the divorce. When, in March, Moore confirmed in an interview that he\u2019d begun seeing Prinz while still married, the website Jezebel confidently declared, \u201cThurston Moore Confirms He Is a Dick.\u201d Moore found the attention surprising (\u201cI\u2019m in an alternative experimental rock band, for God\u2019s sake. Big fucking deal\u201d) and unpleasant. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d he says, wincing. \u201cIt\u2019s humiliating. It affects people close to me in certain ways \u2013 my family, the woman I\u2019m in love with. It can be really degrading and I try to be philosophical about it. As soon as I put the [laptop] lid down and walk out the door, it\u2019s not there.\u201d While Moore\u2019s fraught and folky, Beck-produced 2011 album Demolished Thoughts was recorded while his marriage was in peril (\u201ca very intense record for me to do at that time\u201d), his new one, The\u00a0Best Day, is bigger, bolder and more outgoing and contains, he insists, no tidbits for the gossips: \u201cI would never do that.\u201d The Best Day advertises its optimism with a cover shot of Moore\u2019s mother, bathing in the sea with her dog, in Florida in 1940. He chose the image \u201cbecause it conveyed a sense of peace and calm in a world where we don\u2019t always have that. I\u2019m in this place where it\u2019s really welcoming and happy for me, and there\u2019s a certain sound of pleasure on this record. So this photograph is so fitting for how I feel right now.\u201d The Thurston Moore Band features My Bloody Valentine\u2019s Debbie Googe on bass, Sonic Youth\u2019s Steve Shelley on drums and Moore\u2019s Stoke Newington neighbour James Sedwards on guitar. Just a year ago, however, Moore was fronting a completely different band, Chelsea Light Moving, and insisting he\u2019d keep the name. So what\u00a0changed?\u201d \u201cAt the time I really desired anonymity without losing my desire to work in the public realm as a musician,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while it was kind of OK. I struggled through my personal issues while touring in the back of a van and playing every little basement that would accept us. I was just in a band. This wasn\u2019t the Thurston Moore Show. But that wore thin after a while. And I was mentally \u2026\u201d \u2013 a rueful smile \u2013 \u201closing my shit. I needed to leave the United States, move to London, and contemplate what exactly I was going to do.\u201d            As a teenager, Moore fantasised about running away to London, where the bands were younger. \u201cI was the same age as Johnny Rotten and Viv Albertine and Sid Vicious and I was like, how come they\u2019re not here? New York City was intellectuals, art-school graduates and poets.\u201d But he thinks London would have been too large and diffuse for him then. A natural collaborator and connector, in love with the idea of community, he thrived in Lower Manhattan. \u201cNew York is a street-corner world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be in a hermit state in New York.\u201d Sonic Youth grew out of a rowdy, close-knit world and became a keystone in New York\u2019s music scene but Moore felt the band was running out of road after 30 years and 15 albums. \u201cIt probably sounded like Sonic Youth was making records for the sake of making records,\u201d he says. \u201cThat bothered me a little bit because I felt each record was a very serious undertaking.\u201d Playing live became less fun too. \u201cI felt that the audience had reached a place of complacency where we were decoded. That edge of wonder and surprise had all but disappeared. A lot of what we developed over the years has seeped its way into music culture. We weren\u2019t the radical band any more; we were more of a radical reference point. I was getting a little bored with people getting bored with us.\u201d He insists there\u2019s no \u201cdecree of finality\u201d on Sonic Youth, but he\u2019s not hankering for a reunion. \u201cIt defines me and it always will,\u201d he says. \u201cI would never want to replicate that. This band is something else. I always feel like I\u2019m in a state of apprenticeship. I never feel like I\u2019ve achieved something where I can actually get retrospective.\u201d So he doesn\u2019t feel the weight of the past? He beams, his faith in the future undimmed. \u201cNo weight whatsoever.\u201d \u2022 The Best Day is released on 20 October on Matador Records", "sentences": ["It\u2019s really intense and heavy on both sides.\u201d     Thurston Moore, far left, Lee Ranaldo, Steve Shelley and Kim Gordon in Sonic Youth, Amsterdam, 1986."], "title": "Sonic Youth\u2019s Thurston Moore: \u2018There are very few bands where people work together and live together\u2019", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/16/sonic-youth-thurston-moore-divorce-london-future", "tags": ["Sonic Youth", "Kim Gordon", "Indie", "Music", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-10-17T06:30:00Z", "article": "A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Here&apos;s why public Wi-fi is a public health hazard &gt;&gt; Matter Maurits Martijn:   In his backpack, Wouter Slotboom, 34, carries around a small black device, slightly larger than a pack of cigarettes, with an antenna on it.

With paid coverage, developers share responsibility with YouTubers &gt;&gt; Gamasutra  It&apos;s been several months since Gamasutra investigated the ethics of paying for YouTuber coverage for video games, and the disclosure that is required in these circumstances to meet legal requirements. But while some YouTubers have taken this on board, many others have actively ignored the advice, or questioned whether they really need to provide the disclosure suggested. Numerous YouTubers have been in touch with Gamasutra in the last few months, both to question exactly what sort of disclosure is required of them, and to provide plenty of examples where big-name YouTubers and YouTube networks are telling their clients to ignore the advice.  So Gamasutra asked the US FTC what disclosure was required. Answer: it&apos;s not that simple, because of embedding. Google drops 3% after reporting weaker-than-expected third quarter revenue, disappointing non-GAAP EPS of $6.35 &gt;&gt; TechCrunch  The company reported net income of $3.72bn in the period. Breaking down Google&apos;s revenue by segment, you have the following: \u2022 Sites revenue: $11.25bn. Up 20% from the preceding year&apos;s quarter. \u2022 Network revenue: $3.43bn. Up 9% from the preceding year&apos;s quarter. \u2022 International revenue: 58% of revenue. Up 2% from the preceding year&apos;s quarter. The company reported that its average cost-per-click fell 2% in the period, a weakening in a key revenue source. However, pushing back against that decline was a 17% year-over-year increase in &quot;aggregate paid clicks&quot;. So, while the amount of revenue that Google managed to extract from a click went down mildly, it sold more than one-sixth more compared to the year-ago quarter. It is becoming more expensive to run Google. The company&apos;s earnings report details its increasing cost base: &quot;Operating expenses, other than cost of revenues, were $6.10bn in the third quarter of 2014, or 37% of revenues, compared to $4.58bn in the third quarter of 2013, or 33% of revenues.&quot;\u00a0Put another way: Building out new revenue streams, and investing in future products that won&apos;t monetize for some time isn&apos;t cheap.  ABI Research: Apple Watch will end Android&apos;s smart watch dominance &gt;&gt; FierceWireless  Android&apos;s dominance of the smart watch market will come to an end in 2015 when the operating system&apos;s (OS&apos;) share of the sector will fall to under 50% for the first time as it succumbs to pressure from Apple. ABI Research forecasts the share of Google Android powered smart watches will fall even as device shipments using the OS rise. The research company predicted that the number of Android smart watches shipped will grow from around 6m units in 2014 to 15m in 2015, but noted that shipments of Apple&apos;s Watch will begin to take share from Android rivals when it launches in 2015. Apple&apos;s iOS is tipped to take a 35% stake in the smart watch market in 2015, and go on to establish at least a 50% share in the years after, according to ABI Research. In contrast, Android&apos;s share is tipped to fall from 67% in 2014 to 42% in 2015. The research company noted that Android accounted for 75% of smart watch shipments in 2013.

What&apos;s going on in the Latin American tablet market &gt;&gt; Counterpoint Technology Market Research Tina Lu:   A few days ago, after checking the mails in my smartphone while waiting for a friend in a local caf\u00e9 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I raised my eyes and started to look what people around me were doing, a habit which I picked up during my time in the Consumer Insights team at Bestfood-Unilever. I realized that everybody around me was using some sort of electronic device! Most people in groups have a smartphone, while half of the people that were alone have a tablet. I remember that a couple of years ago in the same situation, you were lucky to find one person with a tablet in a caf\u00e9. More users in Latam are moving to smartphones and tablets. Many are just adding one more device to their existing electronic devices portfolio. However, many users are leapfrogging directly into a tablet device, specially teenagers and kids. The tablet market has reached around 17M units in 2013, with a growth rate of approximately 120% (Couterpoint Research estimation). Growth for 2014, might not reach\u00a0three digits, but still should be higher than 50%. Growth rates differ substantially among countries, so are their drivers and constraints.  However, it&apos;s more subtle once you start digging into specific countries. The cost of false positives &gt;&gt; Laughing Meme  I see Twitter getting beaten up a lot for not deleting the spammers faster. Etsy gets beaten up for not deleting the &quot;resellers&quot; faster. Flickr used to get yelled at for not catching the photo stealers or porn spammers faster. &quot;It&apos;s so fucking easy, they&apos;re right over there, here, let me show them to you, what&apos;s your problem?&quot; This comes from not understanding the cost benefit ratio of false positives in identifying abuse of a social site at scale. Imagine you&apos;ve got a near perfect model for detecting spammers on Twitter. Say, Joe&apos;s perfectly reasonable model of &quot;20+ tweets that matched &apos;^@[\\w]+ http://&apos;&quot;. Joe is (presumably hyperbolically) claiming 99% accuracy for his model. And for the moment we&apos;ll imagine he is right. Even at 99% accuracy, that means this algorithm is going to be incorrectly flagging roughly 2 million tweets per day as spam that are actually perfectly legitimate. If you&apos;ve never run a social software site (which Joe of course has, but for the folks who haven&apos;t) let me tell you: these kinds of false positives are expensive.  Read on to realise just how expensive. (Hint: so much so that two sides of the business will effectively be at war.) Fraudulent Transactions Surface in Wake of Home Depot Breach - WSJ  A large data breach at Home Depot Inc has started to trigger fraudulent transactions that are rippling across financial institutions and, in some cases, draining cash from customer bank accounts, according to people familiar with the impact of the hacking attack.

Pipes lead out to several acres of muddy field, where only a few stragglers from the autumn harvest of potatoes, salads, carrots and onions are left. The tubes are lined with copper to stop corrosion because \u2013 in a move that defies everything we think we know about farming \u2013 de Vos is watering his plants with diluted sea water. Last week the project beat 560 competitors from 90 countries to win the prestigious USAid grand challenge award for its salt-tolerant potato. \u201cIt\u2019s a game changer,\u201d said de Vos. \u201cWe don\u2019t see salination as a problem, we see it as an opportunity.\u201d Here, on one of the Netherlands\u2019 northernmost islands, windswept Texel (pronounced Tessel) surrounded by encroaching ocean and salt marshes that seep sea water under its dykes and into ditches and canals, an enterprising farmer has taken the radical step of embracing salt water instead of fighting to keep it out. And now he thinks he might just help feed the world. Inspired by sea cabbage, 59-year-old Marc van Rijsselberghe set up Salt Farm Texel and teamed up with the Free University in Amsterdam, which sent him de Vos to look at the possibility of growing food using non-fresh water. Their non-GM, non-laboratory-based experiments had help from an elderly Dutch farmer who has a geekish knowledge of thousands of different potato varieties. \u201cThe world\u2019s water is 89% salinated, 50% of agricultural land is threatened by salt water, and there are millions of people living in salt-contaminated areas. So it\u2019s not hard to see we have a slight problem,\u201d said van Rijsselberghe. \u201cUp until now everyone has been concentrating on how to turn the salt water into fresh water; we are looking at what nature has already provided us with.\u201d The scarcity of fresh water has been labelled as the planet\u2019s most drastic problem by the World Bank, NGOs, governments and environmentalists. A fifth of the world\u2019s population already lives in areas of drought, and climate change is only going to exacerbate the problem. Poor farming practices, along with road and pavement building, is raising water tables and increasing the salination of rivers and lakes \u2013 in the Western Australian wheat-belt alone, salinity has caused a 50% fall in the numbers of wetland bird species, and threatened 450 plant species with extinction. Attempts to desalinate sea water are going on around the globe \u2013 the UK has a \u00a3270m plant on the river Thames and Saudi Arabia produces 70% of its drinking water through desalination. But removing the dissolved minerals is expensive, requires much energy and the leftover concentrated brine has to be disposed of. The process is far too expensive to be used for irrigation in poorer countries. But thanks to a partnership with Dutch development consultants MetaMeta, several tonnes of the Texel seed potatoes are now on their way to Pakistan where thousands of hectares of what until now had been unproductive land because of sea water encroachment have been set aside for them. If the experiment works and the potatoes adapt to the Asian climate, it could transform the lives of not only small farmers in Pakistan and Bangladesh,, where floods and sea water intrusion wipe out crops with increasing regularity, but also worldwide the 250 million people who live on salt-afflicted soil. Van Rijsselberghe is happy to be seen as an entrepreneur whose interest was to grow a \u201cvalue added\u201d food crop that would tolerate Holland\u2019s problems with water. He says he used a trial and error approach in development. \u201cWe\u2019re not a scientific institution, we\u2019re a bunch of lunatics with an idea that we can change things and we are interested in getting partnerships together with normal farmers, not people who want to write doctorates.\u201d As a pioneer of organic farming in the 1990s, he faced heavy opposition, while a project to grow sea aster \u2013 a salt marsh-grown salad popular in high-end restaurants \u2013 ended in disaster when 3,000 migrating ducks made an unexpected stop and ate the entire crop in three hours. \u201d He says the Netherlands needs to rethink its approach to food: \u201cA third of the country is sensitive to salination. We put up dykes and pump away the water; we feel safe. We believe that outside the dykes is for the fishermen and inside the dikes is for the farmers. I think we have to stop that and talk to each other. What can be grown on the salt marshes and in the sea? Can we grow prawns in the lakes? We need to have these conversations and rethink the way we produce food.\u201d But where does all that salt go? Aren\u2019t we in danger of overdosing on salt if we eat the Salt Farm Texel crops? \u201cWhat we find is that, if you tease a plant with salt, it compensates with more sugar,\u201d said de Vos. \u201cThe strawberries we grow, for example, are very sweet. So nine times out of ten the salt is retained in the leaves of the plant, so you\u2019d have to eat many many kilos of potatoes before you\u2019d exceed your recommended salt intake. But some of the salads are heavy with salt, you wouldn\u2019t eat them by the bucketful. \u201cAnd there are other potentials, too \u2013 if we could find a grass that was salt tolerant, then it would make a big difference to all those golf courses built in developing countries that are using up all the locals\u2019 fresh water. Nature has already laid out some helping hands for us. Mankind just hasn\u2019t realised it.\u201d  This article was amended on 11 December 2014 to correctly attribute the photograph to Sarah Helena Rijpkema.

It is the first time these astounding masterpieces have been brought together in a single show, and given their immeasurable value \u2013 from The Jewish Bride to Bathsheba, Lucretia, The Anatomy Lesson and The Syndics, from the images of sons and lovers to the inexhaustibly profound self-portraits \u2013 it may well be the last. The Rembrandt it reveals is dark, impassioned, magnificently defiant, at the pitch of his originality \u2013 and bewilderingly unexpected. Partly this comes from the revelation of many unfamiliar loans from abroad, but mainly from the spectacle of his irrepressible power and variety. You think you know late Rembrandt from the mortally tragic self-portrait that opens the show, flown in from Washington, the face looming out of darkness in a great build-up of brushstrokes describing untold nuances from dignity to foolishness, fear, endurance and loss. It ought to be the final face, given the full sorrow it inspires and expresses. But Rembrandt is nowhere near the end: it is 1659, he is only 53 and there is still the most prolific of all decades to come. As far the Dutch were concerned, however, Rembrandt\u2019s glory was over. His rough magic was out of fashion as tastes changed to a smoother Flemish style. Rembrandt was wayward, abrasive, widowed, bankrupted by the purchase of a ludicrously expensive house in Amsterdam, shamed by the birth of an illegitimate child, oppressed by notorious debts. His intensely successful studio had closed, students and collectors were looking elsewhere; yet he concedes no ground, never alters his way of working to pay off the creditors.     \u2018Untold nuances from dignity to foolishness, fear, endurance and loss\u2019: self-portrait, 1659. Photograph: Andrew W Mellon Collection/courtesy National Gallery    The truth of this is shockingly apparent from a vast and confrontational painting never shown in Britain before, The Conspiracy of the Batavians Under Claudius Civilis. Commissioned to celebrate an early Dutch uprising against the Romans, the picture is a shadow play of warriors ranged along a table that resembles a giant lightbeam, illuminating their raw and primitive faces from below. Claudius Civilis towers above them, one empty eye-socket gaping in the darkness, a monstrous figure anticipating late Goya. The picture was made for Amsterdam\u2019s new town hall; the burghers took it down almost immediately. Numerous tactful explanations have since been proposed, but paintings are their own evidence and this one is wildly outlandish, coarse, frightening, painted in bursts of impasto that glimmer strangely in the ambient light. Rembrandt imagines the past as less heroic than fearful. He was never paid for the work. You see this daring all through the show: Juno is a heavyweight bully of a goddess; Jesus is a winter baby, weak and cold, staring pensively out at the Christmas world; the apostle Paul is a vulnerable old veteran in a shabby cap (modelled by Rembrandt himself). His religious art is radically human, his most ethereal visions have their roots in this earthly world.     The Conspiracy of the Batavians under Claudius Civilis, 1661-62. Photograph: Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Sweden    A rare and acute insight into his mind comes with a group of drawings rapidly sketched from life (and death). In 1664, Rembrandt took a boat out of town to the gallows where a teenager had been hanged for accidentally killing her landlady. Holes in her socks, young features barely formed by time, the girl dangles flaccid and forlorn from the gibbet. Rembrandt\u2019s image is tiny but overwhelming. What took him there? The same compulsive passion for the world in all its randomness, injustice, reality and beauty, that draws him to contemplate a sleepy nude, an inquisitive child or his own ruined face, an almost militant naturalism in every painting. Walking in the open countryside, working in the fire-lit studio, visiting friends: this show gives a far greater sense of Rembrandt moving through his life than any before. Convention has him as an artist perpetually alone in a brown study, perhaps because he comes before us this way in the self-portraits, but even at his death Rembrandt\u2019s much-forgotten daughter Cornelia was with him. There are many late portraits of friends, and though he may have owed a fortune to the elderly man in the eponymous portrait from the Hague, the brushwork is so tender, so goodly in its affectionate appraisal of the man\u2019s plump and rubicund face, one can only feel the mutual empathy. We see Rembrandt as the outstanding chronicler of the human face, daily altered by experience. Jacob Trip, industrialist, appears as a wizened but hawkish potentate in his 80s; not a spent force so much as a figure of terrific authority, given stature by his pose, but also by the intense massing of paint in the shrewd face. His wife Margarethe, sober and old, quietly rising above the harsh ruff encasing her neck, is a portrait of extraordinary dignity. Tenderest of all is The Jewish Bride, the man and woman whose names are lost but whose love survives. One sees them as distinct individuals, profoundly observed with their generous faces, but that loving gesture \u2013 his hand on her breast, hers gently covering it \u2013 seems to exceed portraiture so that the picture becomes a secular altarpiece, an inspiration to patience, humility and kindness. The man\u2019s sleeve, with its heavy jewellery of impasto nubs catching the light, is one of the most famous passages of painting in art and to see it here is to understand why people crossed Europe to witness the way Rembrandt turned paint into gold. You see this everywhere, in the thick traceries that make embroidery seem to glitter, in the way he makes paint mimic the nap of velvet, the soft weight of flesh, the elusive haar of fine hair. He uses the brush handle to etch tendrils into still-wet paint, smears the pigment with his fingers to make hands, scumbles and smudges it to get the tangible surface of life. Rembrandt fashions our human clay, and he shows the workings of his art.     \u2018He paints the darkest deeds and the deepest emotions\u2019: Rembrandt\u2019s Lucretia, 1664. Photograph: Andrew W Mellon Collection/courtesy National Gallery    This is put to exceptional effect in the self-portraits, of course, but also in the late parables and legends, particularly the version of Lucretia from Washington. Lucretia, raped by an Etruscan nobleman, would rather stab herself than live with dishonour. Rembrandt paints her, knife in hand, in a kind of fugue state as fate comes towards her. The picture has two radically different registers: a smooth pale haziness for the hallucination in which she finds herself; and the thick, black, heavily worked shiv sharpened to its horrifying tip, as if to pierce both the dream and the sleepwalking body. The picture is intensely moving; so are they all. Rembrandt\u2019s imagination can get into the heart of any human life. He paints the darkest deeds and the deepest emotions, the highest grace and the worst sorrow, and he finds mercy for all, including himself. Rembrandt in the dying months, the last light in his eyes, still makes himself felt in the astonishing brushwork \u2013 distressed, perfunctory, thickening in skeins or wearing fine as skin, slow, pensive, or majestically resurgent, always rising to meet the human condition. The final paintings are monuments of truth. Dark and knotted images that close in on many faces, they make you feel you are seeing these saints and martyrs and humble people in person as well as in paint. From them we learn what it is to be alone, broken-hearted, stricken, contemplative, if we don\u2019t already know it; the connection is deep and immediate, the sense of intimacy as profound as when Rembrandt paints himself. It hardly seems possible that the cathartic power of the opening self-portraits could be sustained through the show but so it continues to the very end.

One minute Fahad Abdul Kariem was wedged into the hold, legs apart so that another migrant could sit in front of him. The next, the Mediterranean swell was rolling the vessel, the motion aggravated by the scores of African and Indian migrants clinging to the roof canopy. And everyone was in the water. \u201cI was under the boat when my hand caught a lifebuoy that I clung to as the last resort,\u201d Kariem said of the shipwreck off Libya this summer. \u201cI saw bodies floating on the sea. Some were wearing lifejackets. One was a child. But I could not see where my friend Ayman was.\u201d  In those desperate moments in late August, Ayman became another statistic, one of the more than 2,500 people who have died or are missing feared dead after trying to get into Europe across the Mediterranean this year. It\u2019s also a record year for arrivals \u2013 160,000 in the first nine months of the year, already more than double the total for the previous record in 2011. More than 90,000 people have been fished out of the water by the Italian navy.  Why is 2014 proving such a terrible year? The answer is a combination of factors: war, upheaval and economic rout on Europe\u2019s periphery; the cynicism of smugglers who can charge as much as $10,000 (\u00a36,200) to move a person from A to B, even if B is the bottom of the ocean; the breakdown of law and order in one of the principal conduits for migrants \u2013 Libya; the Italian rescue mission which paradoxically may be encouraging more people to risk every\u00adthing in overladen fishing vessels ill-equipped for the job.  Even for those who make it, the reality of life in Europe as an asylum seeker or economic migrant is likely to prove crushing. They aren\u2019t hard to spot: hanging around in the Sicilian countryside, huddled at the railway stations of middle Europe, mustering in the cafes of Athens or in the ghettoes of Amsterdam or Stockholm. For some, the odyssey will come full circle. They will go back home defeated. Origins       It doesn\u2019t matter where they come from. There is no shortage of broken states on the European periphery. They could be from Damascus or Dakar, Kabul or Khan Younis. They may be Somali or Sudanese, it doesn\u2019t matter. We call them all migrants, but the word is unsatisfactory shorthand. It doesn\u2019t come close to encompassing the desperation of the escaper, the fear of the clandestine, the boredom of the itinerant, the lung-filled panic of the shipwrecked, the desolation of those who actually make it only to find Europe doesn\u2019t want them. It doesn\u2019t convey the scale of a group of more than 200 million souls (if migrants populated one country it would be the fifth biggest in the world). It doesn\u2019t do justice to a global people-trafficking business worth at least $7bn (\u00a34bn) annually. Abraham Russom can count himself one of the lucky ones, if you consider it lucky to survive a shipwreck in which 366 fellow passengers died. His journey from the Horn of Africa to Scandinavia took the best part of six months. \u201cI crossed the desert on foot. I was four days in Khartoum. Two months in Libya. Two months in [the Italian island of] Lampedusa. In Rome, I ran away. And nobody stopped me, thank God. I arrived in Frankfurt by train, then by bus to Stockholm, where I made a request for political asylum.\u201d Countries are spitting out their people for different reasons: war, revolution, bad governance, dead-end economies, climate change, poverty, persecution. Or, as migrants themselves put it:            Death at sea: Syrian migrants film their perilous voyage to Europe. Video by Antonia Roupell    \u201cI had problems with the Taliban and had to leave Afghanistan in a hurry.\u201d (Mohamad Ajub, 22, a farmer from Ghazni province) \u201cMy house was confiscated by a Chechen jihadi after the advance of the Islamic State through Riqa.\u201d (Ahmed Salih, a Syrian from Riqa) \u201cAll Yazidi want to leave [Iraq] but most don\u2019t have the money to get out.\u201d (Salar Faez, 23, a Yazidi from northern Iraq) \u201dI have to get to Europe \u2013 it is the only way I can help my family.\u201d (A Ghanaian stacking shelves in Tripoli, who did not want to be named)       \u201cIt was obvious that the regime\u2019s grip was getting tight around my neck with the capture of two of my siblings within a fortnight.\u201d (Bahjat Imam, a Syrian from Aleppo) As for Russom, he left for more prosaic, though equally pressing, reasons: to escape the poverty and repression that has turned Eritrea into one of Africa\u2019s most rapidly emptying countries. An estimated 200,000 Eritreans have left in the past decade \u2013 more than 3% of the population. Routes       The journey to Europe does not go in a straight line. There are no timetables, reservations or 12-hour layovers in an airport hotel. This is an odyssey in the originalsense of the word \u2013 protracted, circuitous, not necessarily bound to end. There are myriad routes. Some are circuitous, others take bafflingly convoluted detours. The average cost appears to be $5,000-$10,000. If it doesn\u2019t work out, you don\u2019t get your money back. From Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and points further east, Turkey is one option, a conduit either to Greece across the Aegean sea or to the Balkans over land. But these land routes have become less viable in recent months, squeezed by border crackdowns. So some smugglers are routing their charges further south, to Egypt, and the beaches of Alexandria and Damietta, or else flying them to Algiers and Tripoli for onward shipment through the central Mediterranean.       From sub-Saharan Africa, all routes point north, either to Libya and Egypt for those from the Horn of Africa, or Morocco with its tiny Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, and Tunisia for those from west Africa. Jimi Petros\u2019s journey took 557 days. He walked away from his desert village in Eritrea with nothing but sandals on his feet. \u201cThere were two of us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe followed a trail in the dark. The guide told us: \u2018Don\u2019t speak and do not turn on your cell phone.\u2019\u201d So they didn\u2019t. \u201cEven the smallest of lights could have caught the army\u2019s attention. We were risking prison.\u201d They arrived in Khartoum days later. Petros spent a year sweeping the streets to earn money for his journey northwards. He paid $5,000 to five human traffickers. Bahjat Murad\u2019s journey, which started in Aleppo last year, was no less bewildering. Having scrambled across the border with Turkey he paid $6,000 for the first leg of a voyage with no clear destination. \u201cI was hurried to the bottom of the ship and locked in a tiny cabin for a week. I lived on biscuits and juice. I had no idea where the ship was going until a Turkish guy came one night and just said \u2018Libya\u2019.\u201d The routing options do not end there. The western Balkans is a notorious smuggling funnel for those desperate to get into an EU country, principally Hungary to the north or Bulgaria to the south. There are land borders further north in which migrants are regularly caught trying to get into Slovakia, Romania and the Baltic republics. But if there is a hub, a clearing house for the complex, cynical and murderous business of trafficking migrants, then it is a place where the state is defunct and society disenchanted, where the border guards are biddable for $400, where the beaches are broad and where the sea lapping the shore stretches north to another far more promising coastline. And that place is Libya. Beaches       Libya\u2019s version of the Mary Celeste sits bobbing up and down tied to a stanchion in Tripoli harbour. A battered black Zodiac craft, it was found by the naval coastguard drifting at sea, with no engine and no sign of the Somali migrants who had been on board. Only their personal effects remain: passports, identity cards, mobile phones, bank notes and bleached photographs of family groups. \u201cSome of these people we know, we\u2019ve caught them before,\u201d said one coastguard officer, who declined to give his name. \u201cI suspect they are dead, because if they were picked up, they would not leave these things behind.\u201d Similar tableaux are played out each day along Libya\u2019s 1,100 miles of coast, as bodies and abandoned craft are washed up on the beaches, a reminder of the human cost of the vast flow of migrants from this north African country. Libya\u2019s people-smuggling business is highly organised and hugely profitable. Traffickers offer two kinds of service. For the richer customers, mostly Syrians, $5,000 buys a crossing by Zodiac to France, a longer journey than Italy but a safer one because there are no naval patrols. For everyone else, $1,000 buys a place on a cramped fishing boat. \u201cI want the France option, everybody does, but I don\u2019t have the money,\u201d said Mohammed, a heavy-set Syrian who escaped fighting in Damascus and lives in a small Tripoli hotel as he hunts for a boat. Eritreans comprise one of the largest groups in Libya, sustained financially by wire transfer from their compatriots already in Europa, and supported spiritually by St Francis Catholic church, which runs a weekly clinic for Christians. \u201cMany of the Eritrean women come here pregnant, we have to help,\u201d said Sister Inma Moya, a Spanish nun. \u201cWhy so many pregnant? Because if you are a woman, in these situations, you need a man for protection for the journey, and so she travels with him, and so she becomes pregnant.\u201d Tripoli is the main gathering point, but the smugglers themselves steer clear of the capital, preferring the more district locations such as Zuwara or Garabulli. Zuwara is popular because it is close to Sicily, 300 miles north, and because it is populated by ethnic Amazigh (Berbers), who exclude outside security forces, giving smugglers a freer hand, according to Tripoli police. Garabulli\u2019s attraction is that it is separated from the coastal highway by sandy bluffs, masking migrants from passing security units. In contrast to the misery in which they trade, Libya\u2019s people smugglers make big profits. A boat full of migrants each paying as much as $1,000 can rake in $250,000, easily enough to write off the cost of the boat should it founder. And they do. \u201cThe traffic of human beings is a service widely requested on the market,\u201d said one 35-year-old smuggler in Zuwara, who would not give his name. Sitting in an armchair in his new apartment, he revealed plans to buy a villa in Italy next year. \u201cSo far, none of boats I filled with people have sunk.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re very professional,\u201d said Souad, a Syrian teacher who arrived by boat in Europe. \u201cOur smuggler picked back roads. Every 300km [186 miles] we stopped at an empty house where we were given water and a sandwich. Always the same. Everything was very organised.\u201d     A body on the beach at Zuwara. Photograph: Nancy Porsia    Libyan coastguards think smugglers could move three or four times as many migrants if they had more boats, but most only make a single trip, and new vessels are getting harder to find. Libya\u2019s boat builders are frustrated because the onset of civil war cut deliveries of timber from Egypt. Often the smugglers just hand the boat over to the migrants, to avoid arrest by Italian ships patrolling the Mediterranean. \u201cThey give one of the migrants the keys,\u201d said Ben Suleiman, deputy commander of 20 support company, a militia that processes migrants in a temporary detention centre at Tripoli zoo. \u201cThey go to sea with no training.\u201d Some migrants do not get to sea at all. Abdul Rahman Ali, 27, from Niger, paid what money he had, $400, to get to the coast with two friends. One was arrested, while the other fell sick and abandoned the voyage. In Tripoli, Ali made contact with agents in Niger who work with people smugglers, but lacked the minimum $1,000 for a place on a boat. Trying to raise the money, he joined hundreds of African migrants looking for work each morning at a highway intersection, where he was arrested and taken to the detention centre at the zoo. His name was recorded and he was tested for Aids and hepatitis, and told he would be held until a bus was ready to drive him back to Niger. \u201cIt was a hard journey to get here, we spent days in the desert in a 4x4, hiding under a tarpaulin,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I go back, but I will have to try again. In Niger there is work, but it is maybe 10 dinars [about \u00a34] a day. Everyone I know wants to migrate.\u201d Ocean       For most migrants, the boat moment is bittersweet. On the one hand, this is the point they have yearned for, the culmination of all those miles on foot, all those thousands of dollars they cannot afford. On the other, the fear is palpable. Some will have barely been in the sea before. Most will know that the vessel they are being herded into stands at best an even chance in the robust Mediterranean swell.     Fahad Abdul Kariem, a Syrian refugee from Aleppo, was on a ship with friend trying to get to Europe when the engine broke down. He escaped to Denmark but never saw his friend again. Photograph: Mona Mahmood    In the dead of night Fahad Abdul Kariem and Ayman Karawani left the secret house where they had in effect been incarcerated for 18 days with nothing but the clothes they were wearing. They were driven to the Libyan beach where they found 600 people hustling for space on a boat built for less than half that number. \u201cWe walked in the sea till the water reached our necks to get near the boats,\u201d Kariem recalled. \u201cAll our passports and money got wet by the time we reached the plastic boats. Smugglers were throwing us on the boats in haste in fear of being spotted by the police.\u201d The Zodiacs took them to an old wooden fishing boat, perhaps 30 metres long. \u201cYou had to open your legs to allow another man to sit in front of you,\u201d Kariem said. \u201cThe sailor was a young Tunisian guy who charged $10,000 for driving the boat. He drove for 10 km [six miles] and then the engine broke down.\u201d Water began to get in. Frantic bailout attempts failed. Bahjat Murad was on the same boat. \u201cAn Italian ship emerged in the horizon and the smugglers managed to get in touch with its crew,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe ship sent a boat to inquire how to help and offered to get us life jackets and move a few kids and women to the Italian ship. All the Africans and Indians came on top of the ship, which began to shake left and right as water was filling the engine room rapidly. We were trying to hand a kid to the Italian boat but were pushed away by the high waves. \u201cSuddenly, the ship turned to the left and then capsized. All those who were on the roof automatically fell into the sea. Some people were clinging to the edge of the ship, others were struggling under the water. People were like autumn leaves scattered everywhere floating with their life jackets shouting and screaming. Some of them were crying as the life jacket was shredded, others were looking for their relatives. It was hard to breathe with the high crashing waves. Then the Italian boat brought some lifebuoys and released them around the sinking ship. I swam towards the Italian ship but the waves were pushing me backwards whenever I got closer. By a miracle, I managed to cling to a lifebuoy, where there were 25 people around.\u201d Ahmed Salih also got on an ill-fated boat. \u201cI walked in the sea till water reached my neck,\u201d he recalls of his August shipwreck. \u201cMy rucksack got completely wet and all bottles of water we took with us were dropped by smugglers in the sea. There was a fight for lifejackets. All the migrants pressed towards the windows and the ship\u2019s balance was shaken. It capsized in a few minutes. I was under the ship, unable to open my eyes in the salty water. I came out of the window up to the sea surface and clung to the edge of the ship. A family was sitting beside me, they managed to come upward too but their 20-year-old daughter could not.     A rescue mission off the coast of Libya, October 2014 Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/REUTERS    \u201cI was beating water with my feet and could feel a body underneath. I dragged it by the hair to the surface, it was my friend\u2019s daughter. She was dead.\u201d Another group of migrants are only alive thanks to a quirk of fate: their boat was so rotten it sank almost immediately. They were still close to the shore and were spotted by Zuwara\u2019s lone coastguard launch. They escaped with their lives \u2013 but few of them feel lucky. \u201cI paid all this money \u2013 $1,000 \u2013 just to end up back here,\u201d said a 65-year-old Syrian woman from the Yarmouk settlement in Damascus. She flew to Tunisia to find someone to help her join her daughter in Stockholm. She paid smugglers to cross to Libya via Algeria, only to be robbed in the mountains. Months later she tried again, paying $2,000 to undertake the same dangerous trek. After weeks hiding in Zuwara, she paid her passage on the boat. \u201cIt sank from under us,\u201d she said. \u201cSo here we are.\u201d       A fellow Palestinian named Mohammed, sitting next to her wearing a black-and-white headscarf, gave a bitter smile. \u201cWe sailed for five hours, but then the boat engine broke,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were refugees in Syria, then we were refugees in Lebanon, now we are refugees again here.\u201d Jimi Petros survived perhaps the most worst shipwreck of them all, the night in October last year when 366 migrants died off Lampedusa, the tiny Mediterranean island that has become a miserable byword for transitory migrants. \u201cI was out on the deck,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t seasick, but my legs were sore. We were squashed in so tightly together that I wasn\u2019t able to move them much. When the captain saw the lights of the island, he switched off the motor. Two boats passed us, but neither of them stopped. It was really bad. Water was coming on board and the motor wouldn\u2019t turn on again. So the smuggler set a blanket on fire to attract attention. Then panic erupted on board.\u201d Petros had only been in the sea once before. A friend, Ahmed, had told him that the best way to float was to turn supine and pretend to be dead. \u201cI fell into the sea, fully clothed. My friends were screaming around me, but I couldn\u2019t do anything. I pulled up my feet and I was able to kick off my shoes. I got dragged under and I swallowed some water. Then I remembered what Ahmed said. For four hours I prayed to God for my sins with my eyes fixed on the sky.\u201d Mainland       For those who are fished out of the sea \u2013 and there has been on average 500 a day this year \u2013 the misery is not yet over. Perhaps the real tragedy of the new boat people is that once they make it to Europe, they are hardly wanted. Interned sometimes for weeks at a time at processing camps, migrants are quickly disabused of any notion that they have arrived in the promised land. In Sicily, a principal transit point for Italy, cash-strapped local authorities have struggled to offer even the most modest shelter. Some migrants have been housed in sports halls; some in churches; some even in tents at the port. Many simply vanish as they set off on their journeys north.     Officials stand over the bodies of some of the African migrants killed in a shipwreck off the Italian coast in Lampedusa. Photograph: Ettore Ferrari/EPA    In some cases the ad-hoc reception strategy has caused discomfort among the local population, but in others it has generated solidarity. \u201cI used to watch what was happening in Lampedusa on the TV and think: \u2018Poor guys,\u201d said Enzo Amato, who runs a makeshift, frequently overcrowded reception centre for boys in his old primary school in Augusta, eastern Sicily. \u201cNow we\u2019ve all been plunged into this new world. It\u2019s become a mission for us all.\u201d After the Lampedusa tragedy, Italy scrambled a new force called Mare Nostrum to patrol the Mediterranean and rescue stricken migrant vessels. Since then the \u201cmilitary-humanitarian\u201d operation has saved more than 90,000 people at a cost of \u20ac9m (\u00a37m) a month. \u201cWe asked early on \u2026 whether other countries would contribute money. But there was nothing. From anyone,\u201d said an Italian diplomat in Brussels. Italy is now planning to discontinue the rescue service next month, when the EU border force Frontex is supposed to take over. Amnesty International has warned that this will endanger more lives as Frontex does not have a search and rescue mandate. Rescued migrants are supposed to be processed in the country they first arrive in. In practice, Italy turns a blind eye to them heading north. Someone else\u2019s problem. \u201cThere is an unspoken truth that too many countries just don\u2019t want refugees in Europe at all,\u201d said one of the highest ranking EU officials dealing with migration.       And so people such as Mustafa Saidykhan, a teenager from Gambia, are left to make it up as they go along. \u201cI drive trucks, that\u2019s what I want to do. So I want to go to Germany,\u201d he said, after being rescued and deposited at Reggio Calabria. But first he must go wherever the coach revving its engine at the port is taking him. He has no idea where that is. Ten days later he called to say he has made it 500 miles up Italy. It is just as far again to Germany and Mustafa does not yet have a truck to drive, just a plastic bag with a change of clothes. Many migrants realise that the best thing to do is to slip through the net, to keep their options open. Petros found it easy to do so. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen the police heard who we were, they let us go.\u201d From the Sicilian city of Catania he took a boat to Rome; from Rome, a train to Milan. He was ready to stow away in the boot of a car to go further when his aunt called him from Saudi Arabia, where she works as a cleaner. She lent him \u20ac800 and he was able to get a fake passport and plane ticket to Stockholm with a stop in Brussels. \u201cI\u2019d never been on a plane in my life. When I saw the clouds out of the window, I started to laugh,\u201d he said. For those who get to this stage, a long waiting game ensues for the asylum approval that would theoretically enable them to look for work on a continent where jobs are not exactly abundant. Salar Faez, the Iraqi Yazidi, sees little future for himself in Bulgaria, where he was picked up. \u201cIt is impossible for me to live in Bulgaria,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is too difficult for us refugees to make money or find work.\u201d Bahjat Imam is waiting for his asylum case to be resolved in Denmark, still haunted by the rolling ship, still missing his family back in Syria. Ahmed Salih lives in a camp for Syrian refugees near the Danish-German border \u201cwaiting for my next interview\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m glad that I could make it to Denmark, but I still feel for all the friends who were with me on board the ship. They got asylum in the sea.\u201d Mohamad Ajub, the Afghan farmer, is relieved to be safe but cannot find work in Bulgaria. He lives on \u20ac30 a month. \u201cMy idea was just to get to Europe, any country in Europe willing to accept me. I just wanted to live somewhere safe.\u201d Back home       Feet glued with sand, wet clothes wrapped up in a knotted blue plastic bag, Babacar Diagne is straight out of 10 hours on the sea. And he has not caught a single fish. The beach of Soumb\u00e9dioune in Dakar is the scene of his new life. Twelve years ago, he left to go to Europe to fulfil a dream. It didn\u2019t last. \u201cAt the time I really believed,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope, the paradise.\u201d The reality was different. Diagne tried his hand at many things: peddling bags and sunglasses in Genoa, washing dishes in Corsica, working at a warehouse in Florence. He had wanted to give money to his loved ones in Senegal. In reality, most months he was forced to get relatives to send money to him in Italy to pay the rent. \u201cThe Italians have changed,\u201d he said. \u201cA few years ago, people helped out. But the atmosphere has become more hostile.\u201d     Babacar Diagne: \u2018People look at you with disgust when you return.\u2019    Eventually, Diagne scraped together the \u20ac450 to buy a one-way ticket, Madrid to Dakar. The plan had been to return like a king, with enough money to buy a boat, house, car and to send his children to good schools. Well, he is back all right, just without the house and the car and boat. The fishing is harder than ever. \u201cPeople look at you with disgust when you return,\u201d he said. His aunts have scolded him: \u201cThey said: \u2018Why are you here, why are you not in Europe? Other people managed it \u2013 look at their houses.\u2019\u201d But when he is asked by the young people of Senegal, curious about the great, rich continent to the north, Diagne is honest. \u201cI always tell these young men, \u2018Stay here. You do not know what awaits you there. There is nothing. You will suffer.\u2019 \u201cBut they don\u2019t believe me.\u201d Reporting team: Nancy Porsia in Zuwara, Libya; Tobias Zick of Sueddeutsche Zeitung in Dakar; Chris Stephen in Tunis; Tom Westcott in Tripoli; Mona Mahmood; Niccolo Zancan of La Stampa in Gavle, Sweden; Ana Carbajosa of El Pais in Madrid; Lizzy Davies in Rome; Javier Caceres of Sueddeutsche Zeitung in Brussels and Kit Gillet in Sofia", "sentences": ["They aren\u2019t hard to spot: hanging around in the Sicilian countryside, huddled at the railway stations of middle Europe, mustering in the cafes of Athens or in the ghettoes of Amsterdam or Stockholm."], "title": "Migrants\u2019 tales: \u2018I feel for those who were with me.

The trend is causing SMEs to look overseas, developing new markets and expanding their business offering. Derbyshire-based Thornbridge Brewery\u2019s export sales have doubled over the past two years, increasing from 10% to 30-35% of turnover, according to marketing manager Alex Buchanan. \u201cIt came from people knocking on our door. Social media\u2019s been important too. We can tweet about a new beer and we\u2019re getting responses from all over the world asking to buy it,\u201d says Buchanan. The business exports to 33 countries, including Sweden, the US, Italy and Norway, and has just added a Mexican distributor that approached them after checking online reviews. The domestic market for craft beer is becoming increasingly popular, with the Society of Independent Brewers\u2019 members survey suggesting craft beer production increased by 7% last year. Part of the reason the sector\u2019s small businesses are flourishing is the introduction of progressive beer duty in 2002, which means they pay less tax than their larger counterparts. This means that even though an average of 31 pubs close every week, the number of breweries has doubled over the past four years, according to industry trade body Camra. Competition from local breweries, particularly over beer taps in bars and restaurants, is adding to the argument for smaller brewers to look at overseas markets. Camden Town Brewery launched its export business 12 months ago. Head brewer Alex Troncoso says the diversity offered by exports is important. \u201cFrom a wider business sense it\u2019s important not to have all your eggs in one basket. It\u2019s good to spread beer through a few different markets. We\u2019re picking and choosing our markets, and it\u2019s growing from a tiny base.\u201d Breweries say it\u2019s crucial to identify good local distributors in new markets. Troncoso says his sales in Sweden have been built through a relationship with a local distributor. The partner informs them of any tenders from the government-owned off-licence monopoly, for example, and helps manage submitting samples. BrewDog opened in 2007 and has grown to become Scotland\u2019s largest independent brewery - it exports to 50 countries and has bars in five - although it\u2019s resolute in its status as a craft brewer. Exports account for 60% of sales and co-founder James Watt says meeting local distributors was a crucial element of building the business. \u201cVisit them. Strike up relationships with like-minded partners. Don\u2019t just fall for the first people you come across, but spend some time finding people who share your ethos and passion for what you do. That will translate to their market, and will prove invaluable to ensuring strong sales and the experience of your brand locally,\u201d says Watt. Working with local distributors isn\u2019t just about the technical aspects of translating labels, tax and regulation, but understanding how the terminology and culture differs between different markets. For example, brands like Newcastle Ale are common in the UK, but trendy in North America. What\u2019s defined as ale differs across Europe. Travelling can be expensive for small businesses and the need to research new markets and support products can dictate which countries companies target. Cumbria-based microbrewery Hardknott, which generates 20% of its revenue from exports, sells beer in Italy, Spain and Ireland, and is about to launch in Scandinavia. Hardknott founder Dave Bailey says the company did look at Canada, but the travel costs, product transportation issues and difficulty dealing with the country\u2019s state monopoly meant it would be unsustainable. \u201cWe can\u2019t just jump in a plane. Some of the nearer countries you can, but as you get further afield face-to-face is quite difficult to arrange and the further you go from your business the more support you need to give that product and the more difficult that becomes,\u201d says Bailey. It\u2019s also important to ensure pricing in export markets will be sustainable and what price pressures you might face, says Troncoso. \u201cIt is important to not just look for volume, but also for a sustainable selling price. I think a lot of smaller companies think that exporting is going to be the holy grail, but you do it and realise that you are competing with everyone and there are a lot of people out there who have better economies of scale, which ultimately drive the prices down.\u201d Beer festivals are a popular way for brewers to promote products, meet customers and network with potential retailers. UK Trade &amp; Investment organises trade trips and can advise on preparing for exports through its Passport to Export and Overseas Market Introduction Service programmes, both of which are popular with small businesses. However, the matched funding element for travel was dropped earlier in the year. Whatever the hurdles in market research, identifying local partners and supporting products, it\u2019s clear the changing perception of British beer is in-part responsible for the growing export market. New figures from HMRC suggest 20.6 million extra pints of British beer were exported in 2013, compared to 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s only been in the last 12-18 months that British beers have become popular, we\u2019ve had a fight to get over preconceptions. In Amsterdam they were quite traditional,\u201d says Buchanan, who adds Germany is starting to open up, providing a potential audience of 80 million people who are big beer drinkers. Even considering travel constraints, choosing which market to target can be overwhelming. Breweries that have successfully grown their export say they worked hard to develop an idea of where their beer and brand would work. \u201cThere\u2019s a thirst for British craft beer worldwide,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cWe have a got a USP that\u2019s profitable, the question is how do you market yourself?\u201d Watt, who helped build BrewDog into one of the fastest growing food and drinks businesses in the UK over the past seven years, recommends small businesses approach the process with a level of optimistic caution. \u201cConcentrating on what you do best is always key and turning your back on a domestic market that\u2019s doing well would be ill-advised. But if you see an opportunity overseas ... take the chance,\u201d he says.

Hydro66, a data centre provider financed by Black Green Capital, is launching a new facility 70 miles from the Arctic circle in Boden, with the aim of housing high-powered computing equipment for corporate IT customers in Europe. With 800 million people \u201cwithin 50 milliseconds\u201d of the site, its investors claim they will attract corporations seeking to house their data at low cost and with a small carbon footprint, thanks to Scandinavia\u2019s sub-zero temperatures, cheap hydroelectric power and fast fibre-optic network. The new facility will be a tenth the size of Facebook\u2019s, but that has tens of thousands of servers packed together in long aisles, where natural cooling can save a significant amount of power. The latest project depends on persuading companies to locate their servers more than 2,000km from London or Paris, at a time when energy prices are falling and the market for data centres is fast-moving and competitive. Facebook revealed three years ago it would build its first data centre outside the US in Lule\u00e5, 80km south of the Arctic circle, for its own exclusive use; the company said in March it was constructing a second large centre on the site. Bitcoin company KnCMiner this year opened a data centre in nearby Boden where clients can \u201cmine\u201d the digital currency remotely, requiring prodigious amounts of energy and computing power. \u201cWe are looking at a step change in terms of efficiency and green credentials,\u201d said Paul Morrison, business development director at Hydro66. The company plans to invest \u00a350m over five years, starting with an 8,000 sq metre (86,000 sq ft) data centre with 40MW of capacity. It received planning permission from Swedish authorities on Wednesday and is due to open in April or May next year. The company announced a small \u201cproof of concept\u201d project in May on a brownfield site, whose success is the basis for going ahead with the main investment, it said. The new centre\u2019s computing capacity is equivalent to almost twice the total new dedicated data centre demand in London in 2014, according to analysts CBRE. Black Green Capital said its team has an established background of data centre operators in Europe. It is led by tech entrepreneur David Rowe, who sold broadband provider Easynet to BSkyB in 2005 for \u00a3211m. Its investment in Hydro66 is pure private equity with no debt. Data centres have been described as the technology world\u2019s dark energy-guzzling secret. A report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch last month said energy efficiency could become a significant driver of growth for the $220bn (\u00a3137bn) cloud computing market, with information and communication technologies already consuming 10% of the world\u2019s electricity. Smartphones, corporate \u201cbig data\u201d and the internet of things would further expand the digital universe by a factor of 10 by 2020, the report said. Scandinavia is attractive to data centre providers \u2013 Google opened a dedicated centre in Hamina, Finland, in 2011. Green Mountain Data offers data management outsourcing inside a Norwegian mountain cooled by a fjord, while Verne Global runs a similar facility in Iceland. But finding customers outside the region has sometimes been difficult. Knut Molaug, chief executive of Green Mountain Data, which runs a colocation data centre deep inside a mountain at a former Nato ammunition store near Stavanger, Norway, said the company has targeted the British market for more than two years, but had yet to secure a customer, though negotiations were \u201cstarting to have considerable traction\u201d. Some analysts are sceptical about the business model behind outsourcing data management to Scandinavia. The price advantage of locating a data centre in Sweden is small and likely to shrink as technological advances expanded the capacity of cloud computing centres much closer to European business hubs, according to Kjetil Ertn\u00e6s, a data centre consultant in Oslo. \u201cYou might have cheaper electricity for five to 10 years, but you need to think very long term, and the risk will probably be too high for most players because it is difficult in the wholesale colocation market to predict the future,\u201d Ertn\u00e6s said. Tim Anker, director of Colocation Exchange, a UK broker of space in data centres, said the new centre would be \u201cvery tricky to sell. There are a lot advantages to the Nordic region, but the markets in Amsterdam and London are highly competitive. For large wholesale users it makes sense, but the distances involved in any latency sensitive application, such as banking, makes it inappropriate.\u201d But Tiny Haynes, data centre analyst at Gartner, said the sector was set to go the same way as the aluminium industry, where smelters have moved close to hydroelectric dams. His calculations suggest a company in Docklands, London could save 42% on its data centre costs by relocating to Norway. \u201cPeople are dipping their feet in the water, but no one has gone for it in a big way,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cThe scepticism is justified, it is no trivial thing to migrate [IT applications abroad].\u201d Jeff Monroe, chief executive of Verne Global \u2013 whose colocation data centre in Keflavik, Iceland, counts German carmaker BMW and Silicon Valley\u2019s Risk Management Solutions among its customers \u2013 said there was what he called a \u201cdata gravity\u201d trend for companies to split their IT applications and move the low-latency operations \u2013 those that can operate with a tiny time delay \u2013 towards the north. But the sector needed more participants, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like building a restaurant on top of a hill. Once you open you want more restaurants nearby to help draw in the public.\u201d Gary Cook, senior information technology analyst for Greenpeace International in Washington DC, said Facebook\u2019s commitment in 2011 to become long-term carbon neutral had informed its move into Sweden and helped \u201cchange the conversation\u201d among companies with heavy data needs. \u201cA lot of organisations are considering switching to the cloud, and you are seeing more and more players in the market place saying \u2018this is good, but what is our carbon footprint going to look like?\u2019\u201d Cook said.", "sentences": ["There are a lot advantages to the Nordic region, but the markets in Amsterdam and London are highly competitive."], "title": "UK firm takes the cloud to chillier climes with Swedish data centre", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/22/cloud-storage-data-centre-sweden-arctic-hydro66", "tags": ["Cloud computing", "Internet", "Computing", "Technology", "Sweden", "Europe", "World news", "Business", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-10-23T07:00:03Z", "article": "You could never accuse Hans Eijkelboom of a lack of dedication. For his new book, People of the Twenty-First Century, the photographer and conceptual artist spent 20 years lurking around shopping centres \u2013 initially in his native Netherlands, later in America and China. Working almost daily, he would note similarities in the appearance of passers-by and surreptitiously photograph them, or take \u201cphoto notes\u201d as he calls them. \u201cThe process,\u201d he says, \u201cis simply that I walk to the centre of the city where many people are. Then I walk around for 10 to15 minutes. When something in the crowd intrigues me or touches me, I decide that will be the theme of the day. Then I start photographing for two hours. Many times, it goes wrong: I don\u2019t see anything, so I don\u2019t photograph that day; or I go to the city, see my subject, start photographing and, surprisingly, in the next two hours, never see my subject again. And then, for that day, there is no photo note.\u201d Eijkelboom\u2019s previous works have included managing to insinuate himself into the background of every photograph that accompanied the main story in his local paper for 10 consecutive days; convincing wives whose husbands had gone to work to pose for a family photograph with Eijkelboom taking the place of the absent father; posing for self-portraits wearing entire outfits he\u2019d bought for \u20ac10 or less. In those, the photographer was the star. With the photo notes, Eijkelboom effectively has to vanish. \u201cThe camera is hanging on my body, with a wire that goes into my pocket,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I make the photos. When you walk in the city and look through the viewfinder, people say, \u2018What are you doing? Why this photograph?\u2019 And so on. I don\u2019t have time to talk about what I\u2019m doing, I want to get it done in two hours. And when you make a photo in a normal way, you intervene in the situation: people will react to the camera, and will not be normal.\u201d Partly inspired by People of the Twentieth Century, August Sander\u2019s mammoth attempt to document German society from 1911 until his death in 1964, Eijkelboom wants to create a kind of visual diary. \u201cThe work I did before was always about my own identity and identity in society. I always have the feeling I am more or less the product of the society I\u2019m living in \u2013 and the photo notes are trying to visualise my surroundings.\u201d     Furry hoods in Amsterdam, from People of the Twenty-First Century. Photograph: Hans Eijkelboom/Phaidon    The results, collated in a 500-page book, are simultaneously mundane and compelling. Laid out in a grid, the shots of women wearing pink T-shirts or businessmen carrying briefcases have a hypnotic, repetitious quality, but the longer you look at them, the more nuances become apparent. Eijkelboom used a similar technique in an earlier project, Paris-New York-Shanghai, an exhibition and a trio of books documenting everyday life in those cities that was widely perceived as being a deadpan comment on globalisation\u2019s effect on national identity. The point seemed to be that people increasingly dressed the same all over the world. People of the Twenty-First Century offers a more positive message. Eijkelboom occasionally documents a fashion trend, or a tribal allegiance, where people are trying to look alike: bikers, Rolling Stones fans wearing the band\u2019s logo. But more often, the similarities between his subjects\u2019 appearances reveal themselves to be superficial. Eijkelboom might have chanced upon a dozen people all wearing yellow T-shirts, but they\u2019re not a uniform and their significance changes with each person: one shirt is pledging allegiance to a football team, another to a band, another to surfing. \u201cThat\u2019s a very strange development in society,\u201d says Eijkelboom. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the intention at the start of the project, but in the end you could say the book is about a fight, a war within society: more and more, big companies have their grip on people, in producing the clothes and so on. But in the book you see the possibilities to give it your own personal touch. When you now go to the Kalverstraat in Amsterdam, everybody has their own individual message on their T-shirt. But on the other hand, they all look the same, because they are all people with a message on their T-shirt. You can already see a little bit of change, making the power of the big companies weaker, I think. To own clothing by a brand is less important than five years ago.\u201d He thinks this might have something to do with the rise of the internet, which the book inadvertently documents: its earliest photographs come from 1994, an era that was \u201ca little bit more friendly, a little bit more na\u00efve\u201d, when the internet was more discussed than used, when a feature about it in Time magazine still had to open by explaining what the web was. \u201cMy project is related to the city and the crowd in the city. When I look at younger people now, I see more and more that the web is their city. It\u2019s more important now to have an identity on the web, which is very different from an identity shown through your clothes, and you can see that in the book. But I have so much trust in people that I think everybody will find a way to express themselves individually. But in what way? I really don\u2019t know.\u201d Whatever happens, Eijkelboom intends to document it. He no longer goes out five days a week, but his days of lurking around shopping centres are far from over. \u201cIt is very important that I do it for as long as possible \u2013 because the very first photo notes I made are now the most interesting. Time is an important part of the project. I\u2019m now 65. I hope I can do it for another 15 years.\u201d \u2022 People of the Twenty-First Century is published in the UK by Phaidon, \u00a324.95.

Not a happy marriage at all. I had travelled to Amsterdam to share my work on constructive journalism with De Correspondent\u2019s editorial staff. This is a growing domain focusing on reporting news in a more engaging, constructive way. A central component is the \u201cwellbeing model of the world\u201d, in which we challenge our default setting of seeing people as victims to also see them as people with strengths and resilience \u2013 and report on that too. We improve our interview technique by still asking the usual questions that investigate hardship, uncover corruption and mismanagement, but we also ask our interviewees what is going well, because this encourages collaboration and focuses on solutions. It\u2019s about moving from being critical with a negative mindset to being critical with a constructive mindset. Constructive journalism also encourages mediation in political debates, especially around election time. Inspired by family therapy, the notion that journalists should bring politicians together to encourage compromise and establish collaborative solutions creates quite a stir when I tell politicians about it. I shared this framework with a member of the Danish Government and a member of the European Parliament. Both said it would be extremely to difficult to be asked questions about what they respected from the other side or where they could collaborate. \u201cWe are trained in highlighting our differences, not the opposite \u2013 so this would be really demanding and force me to think in entirely new ways,\u201d the MEP said. This is the unharnessed potential of storytelling through news. Scholars and researchers have known for some time what makes stories engaging. I did a study at the University of Pennsylvania where the strongest findings were that negative news stories leave people feeling hopeless and passive. A news article with a constructive peak midway and a hopeful ending left readers feeling more informed and willing to take action. A growing body of research points to the same findings. Adding a solution-based conclusion to a story changes the tone of comments from one of escalating conflict, a \u201che said, she said\u201d rhetoric, to a greater acceptance of opposing views. Research coming out of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill suggests that readers remember more story-related information from articles with silver linings. Looking at what makes news stories go viral, researchers from Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania found that stories that are highly emotionally arousing get shared more. Stories evoking sadness are the least likely to be shared and positive stories inducing awe were shared far more than stories that evoked fear or anger. Journalists are taking note of this evidence and will gather next month in Washington DC to debate and explore best practice. The approach is sometimes criticised for manipulating a public to feel or behave in a certain way. I usually answer that news already has this effect. But, currently the profession is overly blind to it and not conscious about our effect on society and people\u2019s outlook and behaviours. Instead recognising this, being aware and researching it rigorously will allow us to make more informed decisions. De Correspondent celebrated its one year anniversary last month. It launched in 2013 after crowdfunding \u20ac1m from 15,000 backers in eight days.

The film is being described as a passion project for the Oscar-nominated actor, who recently won plaudits at the Toronto film festival for his directorial debut, Seymour: An Introduction, a documentary about classical pianist Seymour Bernstein. Hawke, 43, has been instrumental in developing Born to be Blue alongside producers and Canadian writer-director Robert Budreau over the past year, reports Deadline.

Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke in Before Midnight Photograph: film company handout    Born Chesney Henry Baker in 1929 in Oklahoma, the film\u2019s subject was also known for his skills as a flugelhornist and vocalist. He broke through in the 1950s, playing with Charlie Parker and joining the Gerry Mulligan quartet. But he had already begun taking heroin and was in and out of prison for the next two decades, spending more than a year in prison in Italy on drug charges in the early 1960s and at one point being deported back to the US from West Germany after running into trouble with the law. In 1968 he was savagely beaten by acquaintances and lost the ability to play trumpet after losing several of his teeth, reputedly working for a period pumping petrol to pay the bills. In the 1970s Baker experienced a career resurgence after being fitted with dentures, with Budreau\u2019s film set to suggest that a romance helped him to emerge from his previous difficulties. During this period, Baker is said to have been helped by his girlfriend Diane Vavra, with whom he had a relationship spanning 18 years. He spent much of his time in Europe, returning to the US for just a few gigs each year.     Chet Baker with trumpet, 1955.

When I started out in the tech industry, I relied heavily on gut feeling: something that I believe a lot of entrepreneurs have in common. This approach certainly led to a few mistakes, but every one of those mistakes served to make me a stronger person. It\u2019s important that we accept that mistakes will be made along the way and that sometimes failure can be an acceptable (albeit unpleasant) outcome. I have learned far more from failure than success. With each setback, I became a smarter entrepreneur and better leader. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \u201cOur greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail.\u201d Whether younger me wants to listen or not, there are three pieces of advice that I have to offer, all centred on one common theme: how you present yourself to the outside world. The perceptions you create can have a profound effect on the outcome of any endeavour. This is hard-won knowledge, and something that is much clearer to me now than it was in my youth. Content, knowledge, dedication: all of these are critical to success. But all of that substance must be delivered with style. Confidence, passion and just a little bit of spin can make your end goals much easier to achieve. Public speaking: learn to love it I would urge my younger self to seek professional speaker training much earlier in her career. The benefits would have been huge. While I didn\u2019t exactly shy away from the opportunities that were presented to me, I was never overly confident and I certainly didn\u2019t push myself out there. When I did find myself in a position where I was expected to speak eloquently on a panel or as a keynote, it would be hugely daunting. The nerves would build up days before the actual event, and at times were bad enough to turn a good presentation into an average one. Then in early 2013, something changed. I was attending a tech conference in Amsterdam and I asked the event organiser why there were so few women on stage. His response made my blood boil. \u201cWomen are generally bad speakers,\u201d he said, straight-faced. This was my trigger moment and from that day forward, I vowed to prove him wrong by becoming a more confident, inspiring speaker myself and to strive to correct the gender imbalance that\u2019s so pervasive in the tech sector. The first step was to seek professional training. Not only did this give me the confidence I needed, but the simple tips and tricks I learned ensured I was always ready to present with conviction. Skill led to desire, and more speaking opportunities followed. This in turn boosted my profile, and a virtuous cycle set in. All of this culminated in one of the proudest moment of my career \u2013 my very first TED Talk. \u2018Fake it \u2018til you make it\u2019 I have learned over the years that being too modest will not do you any favours as an entrepreneur. I learned this the hard way, in a sector where my European business was in direct competition with big US tech companies. I would spend months with my team driving new innovations; building, testing, refining and retesting, all to ensure it was perfect before market launch. The main problem? My US competitors would beat us to the punch, announcing their intention to launch a similar piece of tech (sometimes before they had even built it), effectively stealing our thunder and making us look late to the party. Today, I would tell my younger self to be much bolder and to build on confidence and conviction, as well as passion and intellect. Always stay true to yourself, but remember that, more often than not, perception becomes reality. Be your own advocate I wish I had a better understanding of how the media worked when I launched my first company. To have a fighting chance, you need to take control of your image in the industry and in the relevant trade media. Optimist that I am, I had naively assumed that great work would automatically be noticed and rewarded. The truth is that you need to be smart and active in promoting what you do, and you need to make sure you approach the media in the right way. Early in my career, I let some good opportunities pass me by because I got carried away with tech jargon when trying to tell journalists about my business. Simply put, journalists want a smart person to tell them a concise, compelling story. So make sure you are prepared and don\u2019t waste their time. Perhaps most importantly, never, ever be afraid to have an opinion. Stick your neck out every once in a while, challenge the status quo; be controversial. Not only is it good intellectual exercise, it\u2019s almost always entertaining. Janneke Niessen is a serial entrepreneur, technologist, and innovator.

For the breakout American star of the 2014 World Cup, it\u2019s a daily reminder \u201cto stay humble\u201d as expectations for his career steadily rise. Though one might expect the attention to inflate Yedlin\u2019s ego, the 21-year-old fullback believes humility to be a requisite component of success. \u201cOne thing I always remind myself of is that there are always younger players in better leagues doing better things than I\u2019m doing right now,\u201d Yedlin told Eight by Eight. \u201cSo if I\u2019m not there, I need to get there.  For a footballer trying to get there, there\u2019s no greater showcase than the World Cup, and in Brazil, Yedlin impressed on world football\u2019s biggest stage. Making three substitute appearances for J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann\u2019s Yanks, the Seattle-born speedster injected confidence and pace into an often bunkered American team. In his final match against Belgium, Yedlin faced a chilling assignment: enter the match cold and mark Chelsea star Eden Hazard. \u201cI just heard J\u00fcrgen say, \u2018Get up, start moving a little bit\u2014you\u2019ve got to go in right now,\u2019\u201d Yedlin recalled. Despite the pressure, Yedlin seemed to have freon pulsing through his veins, stifling Hazard and sparking a listless American attack to life. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of time to think about what was going on,\u201d he explained. \u201cI just had to go in, be confident, and shut down Hazard.\u201d Yedlin\u2019s quiet, humble confidence isn\u2019t masking a budding ego. Unlike other self-aggrandizing athletes, Yedlin doesn\u2019t need to tell others that he\u2019s good; he knows that he is. For his college coach Caleb Porter, it was Yedlin\u2019s \u201cfearlessness, mixed with a positive attitude, and a refreshing level of na\u00efvet\u00e9\u201d that allowed him to leap from college to Major League Soccer to the World Cup before he could legally buy a drink. \u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks too much about the magnitude of the things that he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Porter. That might be the young player\u2019s most useful quality.  But for football fans in the US yearning for future World Cup glory, Yedlin has come to represent the first fruit of a reform program set in motion a decade ago to remake player development in the US. Seeking to redress a backwards youth system that prioritized winning trophies over creating professional players, MLS and US Soccer both invested heavily to professionalize elite player development in the past decade. Yedlin\u2019s youth career touched every component of those reforms, and if expectations are met, there will be more players like Yedlin flooding MLS sides and US Soccer rosters ahead of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. With a move to Tottenham Hotspur FC scheduled in 2015, Yedlin has become the ideal poster boy for the Klinsmann regime, and if Klinsmann has his way, more young American talent will soon join Yedlin, parachuting into European stadiums and trying to take their game to \u201canother level,\u201d as Klinsmann demands. \u2018He needed to be challenged a little bit more\u2019 Before DeAndre Yedlin\u2019s 12th birthday, the budding footballer had already featured for a dizzying array of Seattle youth clubs, including the West Seattle Magic, Emerald City Football Club, and the Northwest Nationals Soccer Club. Some parents criticized Yedlin\u2019s constant jersey swapping, but Dylan Walton-Yedlin, his uncle, contends that the family \u201cjust wanted to do what was best\u201d for Yedlin\u2019s development, and in Seattle\u2019s competitive marketplace for youth football talent, they were able to seek out the best coaching and training environment. \u201cPeople might have gotten the impression he was some kind of a mercenary,\u201d recalled Walton-Yedlin. \u201cI think he just needed to be challenged a little bit more.\u201d The youth football marketplace that Yedlin competed in emerged in the late 20th century as the sport exploded across the US. With more and more American parents shuttling their kids from pitch to pitch every weekend, top youth clubs grew like weeds to meet the growing demand for a sport that lacked infrastructure. In this competitive environment, clubs were forced to compete for top players, and local youth clubs grew into multimillion-dollar nonprofit organizations capable of paying technical directors six-figure salaries. As professional coaches replaced parent volunteers, the days of halftime orange slices were over for elite American players. In Europe, clubs like Ajax Amsterdam and FC Barcelona finance their extensive academies with first-team revenues, and players participate for free, but in North America those costs often fall to parents who dole out wads of cash to pay for coaches, travel, field space, uniforms, and equipment. \u201cI 100% agree we should make soccer free,\u201d argued TSN commentator Jason de Vos, a former Canadian international and youth-club technical director in Toronto. \u201cBut getting there is a really, really difficult process.\u201d De Vos\u2019s view is shared by many: No one likes pay-to-play programs, but without them, football in the US would be worse off. In Seattle, Yedlin continued to hop from club to club, landing at Crossfire Premier Soccer Club, one of the Pacific Northwest\u2019s top programs. \u201cCrossfire was kind of that premier team that everybody in the state knew,\u201d said Yedlin. \u201cEverybody wanted to play for them.\u201d As an attacking winger, Yedlin had pace and skill that propelled him onto state teams and into national team camps. Yedlin\u2019s ability to see a career in professional football would not have been possible if he had been born in the US a decade earlier. \u201cGrowing up, I honestly wasn\u2019t even thinking about playing college soccer,\u201d recalled Ali Curtis, a former MLS player and senior director of player relations and competition for MLS, \u201cIt\u2019s so different now.\u201d The landscape began to shift with the 1994 World Cup and the birth of MLS in 1996, and elite player development got a jump start two years later when US Soccer and Nike devised Project 2010, a plan to develop a generation of American talent capable of winning the 2010 World Cup. Nike\u2019s initial investment financed the US Soccer under-17 residential academy in Bradenton, Florida. in 1998, nurturing a cohort of players that included future national team stars Landon Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley, and Kyle Beckerman. For US Soccer director of scouting Tony Lepore, Project 2010 provided a \u201cthorough investigation of where we were at that time,\u201d but the reform process had only just begun. Just one residential academy could not produce a big enough player pool to challenge for a World Cup title, so US Soccer launched the Development Academy in 2007, expanding the Bradenton model to the premier MLS youth teams and amateur youth clubs around the United States\u2014like Yedlin\u2019s Crossfire. According to Lepore, US Soccer recognized that elite players and families \u201cwere stretched too thin,\u201d playing too many games against poor competition. Studying the best developmental practices around the world, US Soccer set in motion a philosophy that placed \u201cdevelopment before results\u201d and identified 63 youth clubs in major markets to join the Development Academy. \u201cThe idea was that one club develops a player,\u201d said Lepore. \u201cWe wanted to empower the clubs.\u201d While Project 2010 nurtured the growth of one team, the Development Academy targeted approximately 4,000 players. For de Vos, the thinking was simple: \u201cIt\u2019s better to teach a man to fish than to give him a fish.\u201d As a high school player, Yedlin earned a spot on Crossfire\u2019s Development Academy team, which competed against other Development Academy clubs from Northern California to the rainy climes of the Pacific Northwest. As a Development Academy club, Crossfire now had to train at least four times a week, and players competed only in meaningful games against strong competition. \u201cYou really felt you were professional,\u201d recalled Yedlin. With matches in California and tournaments around the country, Yedlin\u2019s team traveled often, and his grandparents, Ira Yedlin and Vickie Walton, happily paid for the privilege.  Born on July 9, 1993, in Seattle, DeAndre Yedlin arrived at a troubling time for his parents. With his biological father absent and soon to be incarcerated, his mother, Rebecca Yedlin, moved in with her parents for support. Around her son\u2019s first birthday, Rebecca recognized that she was not prepared to raise DeAndre on her own and relinquished formal custody of her son to her parents. Until he went to college, Yedlin lived with them and his uncle, who is nine years older. \u201cI grew up with very strong family support,\u201d said Yedlin. \u201cMy grandparents raised me, and my uncle sort of played that father-figure role in my life.\u201d For Walton-Yedlin, much of the support came from his mother, Yedlin\u2019s grandmother. \u201cHe has a really good relationship with his biological mother,\u201d explained Walton-Yedlin, \u201cBut still, he knows, we all know\u201d that his grandmother raised him.  Though all remember Yedlin as a happy child, he quietly grappled with his family situation. \u201cAs a kid, that can be a little bit tough to understand,\u201d he explained, recalling how he struggled to comprehend \u201cwhy my mom wasn\u2019t raising me, why my dad was in jail.\u201d Even as the post\u2013World Cup spotlight shines on him, Yedlin remains reflective and even-keeled. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s still parts of it that I\u2019m trying to figure out,\u201d he said. Yedlin\u2019s grandparents provided the financial and emotional support that has enabled him to reach his peak potential. \u201cIt could be practice, games, traveling to Lancaster, Calif., or anywhere, and they would be there, and that hasn\u2019t changed now,\u201d said Yedlin\u2019s Crossfire coach Sean Henderson. Walton-Yedlin said, \u201cI could count on one hand how many athletic events they missed, and we\u2019ve got to be in the thousands now.\u201d As an expression of gratitude to his grandparents, Yedlin plans to send them to India this summer to visit the Taj Mahal, a lifelong dream of his grandmother\u2019s. As a senior in high school, Yedlin made one final leap, leaving Crossfire for the Seattle Sounders FC Academy, which also competed in the Development Academy. \u201cIt took a lot of the financial stress off my grandparents,\u201d said Yedlin. (The Sounders Academy was free for players. Crossfire has recently made its Development Academy teams free too.) The move also allowed Yedlin to sign directly with the Seattle Sounders as a \u201chomegrown\u201d player when he was ready for the rigors of professional soccer.  \u201cI look at youth development the way I look at the tech industry,\u201d said Curtis of MLS. \u201cYou see the advances that have been made in the last five years, and those advances have arguably had a greater impact than the advances made in last the last 50 years. And I expect the advances and changes made in the next five years will have a similar effect.\u201d \u2018A potential standout\u2019 It\u2019s strange to think of DeAndre Yedlin as a late bloomer, since he featured in a World Cup as a 20-year-old, but Yedlin \u201cwas very much under the radar\u201d entering college, said Caleb Porter, Yedlin\u2019s coach at the University of Akron. Although Yedlin attended several US youth national team camps, he never featured regularly, and many college coaches were unsure how his skill set would translate to the collegiate level. He was projected to be a winger, and they wondered if he had the technical skill, tenacity, and size to succeed as an attacker, but Porter had a different idea. \u201cI immediately saw a potential standout right back,\u201d said Porter, the current coach of the Portland Timbers. \u201cI get kids all the time that are forwards who shouldn\u2019t be forwards, so it\u2019s pretty normal to take a kid out of position.\u201d In Yedlin, Porter envisioned a modern attacking fullback in the mold of Dani Alves. For players who have not been a part of US youth national teams and are not yet ready to leap into the professional game, college football can be an important (and often the only) developmental path. At the 2014 World Cup, 11 of the 23 players on Klinsmann\u2019s squad spent time playing in college, including captain Clint Dempsey who, like Yedlin, was also an unheralded player when he entered Furman University in South Carolina. \u201cYou play real games in front of real crowds,\u201d said University of Maryland head coach Sasho Cirovski. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that at the academy level or in reserve-team soccer.\u201d Though some have advocated phasing college soccer out of elite development, Cirovski sees the college game as the \u201cglue\u201d within the American development system. Yedlin credits Porter for his development into a player who was ready for the professional leagues. \u201cThere were times when I absolutely hated him,\u201d said Yedlin. \u201cIt seemed like during my freshman year, he\u2019d always be getting on me.\u201d But Porter\u2019s exacting standards forced Yedlin to change the way he evaluated his own play. Porter \u201cmade me mentally stronger and judge myself a little bit harder, which is something that I needed,\u201d Yedlin explained. After two years with Porter at Akron, Yedlin faced another choice: return to Ohio and finish out his collegiate career or accept a contract offer from his hometown club to become the Seattle Sounders\u2019 first \u201chomegrown\u201d player in 2013. Porter advised Yedlin, \u201cIf you\u2019re ready to do this, it\u2019s going to be a step up. You\u2019re thrown into this environment where it\u2019s money and it\u2019s business, and mentally you have to be ready for it.\u201d At 19, DeAndre Yedlin was ready for both the glamour and glare of being a professional. \u2018Who the hell does this kid think he is?\u2019 \u201cWho the hell does this kid think he is with this big blond mohawk,\u201d remembered Eddie Johnson, a teammate of Yedlin\u2019s on the Sounders. Yedlin\u2019s hair \u2013 a bleached mohawk bold enough to make David Beckham blush \u2013 colored many first impressions of the young right back. On a less humble, less well liked player, the attention-grabbing hairstyle might not have been tolerated. But for Johnson, Yedlin\u2019s quiet humility silenced any initial misgivings. Yedlin came to Seattle to play, not to be a distraction. \u201cTo have that hairstyle you have to have a certain amount of confidence,\u201d said Yedlin. \u201cI think I have kind of have the same mind-set that Kanye West has. He just likes to do his thing.\u201d In his first season with the Sounders, Yedlin was not slated to start, but when the first-choice right back went down injured, Yedlin slotted into the starting 11 and never relinquished the position, becoming an MLS All-Star in the process. His play (and hair) attracted the attention of Klinsmann, who inquired about the young right back\u2019s skill and character with the Sounders\u2019 head coach Sigi Schmid, who told Klinsmann to ignore the loud hairstyles: DeAndre Yedlin was a player. Klinsmann invited Yedlin to the annual US Soccer January camp, where the premier MLS talent gathers every off-season to work with the national team. In January 2014, the camp had an added incentive: impress here and earn a spot in Brazil. For Johnson, who moved to DC United as a striker and was a fellow January camp participant, Yedlin was \u201cone of the best players in the camp.\u201d In May, Klinsmann surprisingly named Yedlin to the 23-man roster for Brazil, a decision that would have generated more buzz if not for the high-profile omission of Landon Donovan. In Brazil, Yedlin\u2019s pace and attacking prowess were on display for the best clubs in Europe, and teams from all over the continent were interested in his services after the World Cup. After weeks of rumors, Yedlin chose Tottenham and will transfer in 2015. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the style of play that Pochettino has installed in that team,\u201d said Yedlin. \u201cI think it fits my style very well.\u201d To start at right back for Spurs, Yedlin will have to supplant both Kyle Walker and rising English star Eric Dier. While a loan to another club in England or Europe is possible, much of that depends on Yedlin\u2019s passport situation, as he tries to secure a Latvian passport through his mother\u2019s family. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what [Tottenham\u2019s] plans are right now,\u201d said Yedlin, but \u201cthey want me to come in and battle for a spot.\u201d Which is precisely what Yedlin wants to do.  Some players might be dismayed by the competition at Spurs, but the test entices Yedlin. \u201cI almost got too comfortable in Seattle,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to challenge myself and see what I have and prove to other people and prove to myself.\u201d Yedlin speaks of his talent as if he possesses a potential that only increased competition can unlock. \u201cThe mind is very powerful,\u201d said Porter. \u201cIt can either hurt you or help you. Yedlin doesn\u2019t worry about what could go wrong. He just goes and plays.\u201d Somewhere, Klinsmann is smiling. To make it in Europe, Yedlin will need to improve the underdeveloped areas of his game. Yedlin \u201cstill needs work defensively,\u201d said Porter, a sentiment echoed by many who believe he relies too much on natural speed to cover for defensive lapses. If Yedlin can do so, he could become, according to Sounders teammate Brad Evans, \u201cthe best right back the United States has seen since Steve Cherundolo.\u201d But it won\u2019t be easy in the unforgiving environment that Europe provides. Former Sounder Eddie Johnson advised, \u201cIt\u2019s different in Europe. You\u2019re not just one of the five or six best players within the entire team. Everyone is as good as you. They can always buy new players, so you\u2019ve got to be consistent.\u201d  The cutthroat nature of football abroad has caused many US national team stars to opt against a European odyssey. \u201cYou glorify things a little bit,\u201d said Sounders midfielder Brad Evans, \u201cYou know you want to play for Liverpool, but at the end of the day, most Americans are not playing at the biggest clubs in Europe.\u201d As MLS shells out major-league money to lure the best American talent, like Michael Bradley, Clint Dempsey, and Jermaine Jones, to North America, choosing to play in Europe is more of a competitive decision than a financial one. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s not what the national team coach wants to hear,\u201d concluded Evans, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s quality of life that matters.\u201d Klinsmann is certainly hoping to see Yedlin succeed. Since taking over as national team manager in 2011, he has constantly urged the best American players to compete in Europe \u2013 only to see many return to MLS. Klinsmann hopes that Yedlin will buck the trend, and if the past is any indication for what Yedlin\u2019s future will hold, it\u2019s clear how he will perform: \u201cHe\u2019s got the innate ability to make jumps from level to level,\u201d said Porter. Whether moving from Crossfire to the Sounders Academy or from the Seattle Sounders to the US national team, Yedlin credits his constant success to his confidence. \u201cI think I just have the mentality that I\u2019m always hungry,\u201d he explained. \u201cEven if it is a high level, once I get comfortable and I get comfortable with myself, I know that I can perform.\u201d     Rooney.

She may have not have won (that accolade went to hip-hop trio Young Fathers) but every audience member left the show firm in one belief \u2013 this was not the last they would see of FKA twigs. The 26-year-old is swiftly establishing herself as one of the most interesting and enigmatic faces in British music, drawing comparisons to artists from Kate Bush to Aaliyah. Her genre defying debut album, LP1, released in August has been lauded as one of this year\u2019s most exciting and interesting releases which, with its weird and unpredictable rhythms, soulful vocals and raw, melancholic lyrics, seems to perfectly capture the singer\u2019s complexities. FKA in her stage name stands for \u201cformerly known as\u201d. The world first met FKA twigs when she appeared on the cover of i-D magazine in August 2012. Like former cover stars of the magazine Madonna and Sade, she had yet to release any music \u2013 her first mixtape, EP1, would emerge online four months later. The cover was photographed by esteemed London artist Matthew Stone, who said he could \u201cjust see twigs had that star quality. When I first met her I just had this strong feeling there was something there. There\u2019s an obvious parallel to someone like Bj\u00f6rk, someone who has this crossover appeal but actually has an amazing experimental, transgressive and creative approach to her music. \u201cWhat makes her so interesting is that she knows what she wants. When we worked together on that i-D cover, even before she\u2019d released her music, twigs had this self-awareness and strong vision of where her work would be going and a confidence in her own career and her own creativity \u2013 I knew that wasn\u2019t going to go away.\u201d     FKA twigs performs on stage at Tolhuistuin in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Photograph: Dimitri Hakke/Redferns via Getty Images    While Barnett has described herself as \u201cliving in a constant state of shyness\u201d, Stone said she was always assertive when it came to her creative vision. \u201cShe\u2019s not shy on set, she\u2019s not shy at communicating what she wants to do creatively and on stage she clearly isn\u2019t reserved. She has a strong idea of her own success that doesn\u2019t seem to revolve around compromising on her creativity. What\u2019s amazing is that she has found that magic recipe for being able to use her experimental work as a calling card that people connect to as something that is meaningful and progressive and pretty out there.\u201d Barnett grew up in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, and attended St Edward\u2019s school, an independent Catholic school in nearby Charlton Kings, where she was the only mixed-race girl in her class. She was raised by her mother, a Latin dance specialist who would sneak her daughter into salsa clubs when she was little, and her stepfather \u2013 she only met her biological father when she was 18 and discovered he too was a jazz dancer. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of place where you grow up and stay there. You marry the boy you fancied at high school, and you have kids, and your kids go to the same school you went to,\u201d Barnett once said. \u201cI knew I wanted to get out.\u201d She spent much of her childhood either at ballet classes, which she still attends, or the bootleg youth clubs of Gloucestershire, making music till late in the evenings. Barnett may portray herself as shy and introverted but her honesty about her insecurities as a teenager (\u201cI cried in the mirror as a teenager \u2026 I felt really awkward about myself and my body\u201d) and even about her Gloucestershire accent when she moved to London aged 17 to work as a dancer (she self-deprecatingly refers to herself as \u201ca shy mixed-race girl with a farmer\u2019s accent\u201d) make her stand out in an image-obsessed industry and posit her as a refreshing role model.

Benett/Getty Images for Maserati    Condemning the perfect, photoshopped images fed to people on Instagram, Barnett told Dazed and Confused magazine recently: \u201cHalf of my life I\u2019ve had people staring at me because they think I\u2019m funny-looking and ugly. The other half of my life I\u2019ve had people staring at me because they think I\u2019m fascinating. Everything neutralises. It\u2019s more of a statement on society and how weird it is.\u201d It was on her move to London eight years ago that she met Karen Clarkson, a stylist who still forms part of the tight circle that has formed around Barnett, and is responsible for her distinctive look. When Clarkson first met Barnett, she was still a jobbing dancer, performing cabaret shows in London and later working as backing dancer for singers including Kylie Minogue, Cheryl Cole and Jessie J, but \u201calways doing music in some way, always writing\u201d. Keen to preserve her friend\u2019s privacy, she described Barnett simply as a \u201csweet and quiet\u201d but unstoppable creative force. \u201cShe\u2019s always been this fascinating, intriguing and quiet person in the corner. Now she\u2019s not that person in the corner any more but she\u2019s still the same,\u201d said Clarkson. \u201cTwigs is just an incredibly creative person and everything you do with her is exciting. Every time you do another video she has a new video, she\u2019s always got a new idea and just when you think you\u2019ve done something incredible, she comes up with something else and it\u2019s like \u2018oh my God, we\u2019re going there now\u2019. She\u2019s always moving at a very past pace with her ideas.\u201d     FKA twigs performs during a concert in Berlin, Germany. Photograph: Frank Hoensch/Redferns via Getty Images    Barnett was signed to her record label, London-based Young Turks, after she was spotted singing in New York in 2010 and still maintains control over her creative music output, producing many of her self-penned tracks and directing her music videos. Barnett\u2019s new relationship with former Twilight star Robert Pattinson has also made her into unlikely tabloid fodder LP1 \u2013 which debuted in the album charts at No 16 \u2013 is likely to experience a sales boost following the Mercury shortlisting. Dominant, a 26-year-old dancerwho has worked with FKA twigs for five years, believes \u201cwe are only seeing the beginning of FKA twigs\u201d. He said: \u201cShe\u2019s very creative. She\u2019s shy, a quiet person, but a quiet person with a lot of fire in her. She will stay silent, she does have this mystery about her, and then her work will speak for herself. She has pretty much full control of her own creative projects, she works hard and knows exactly what she wants. What twigs is doing is amazing, she is breaking boundaries and doing exactly what the UK needs.\u201d It was a view echoed by Stone. \u201cFrom this album she has established that she is not going to take any prisoners\u201d he added. \u201cShe will do what she wants and so to see what she does next is really exciting. She is totally, totally a star.

But once you understand what a \u201cmode of production\u201d is the meaning becomes clear. What you are watching is the collapse of feudalism and the emergence of early capitalism. The mode of production is one of the most powerful ideas to come out of Marxist economics: it was prefigured by Adam Smith, who divided economic history into \u201cmodes of subsistence\u201d, but in the hands of Marx himself, and subsequent historians who took a materialist viewpoint, it has shaped our view of the past. Feudalism was an economic system based on obligation: peasants were obliged to hand part of their produce to the landowner and do military service for him; he in turn was obliged to provide the king with taxes, and supply an army on demand. But in the England of Shakespeare\u2019s history plays, the mainspring of the system has broken down. By the time Richard III was slaughtering his extended family in real life, the whole power network based on obligation had been polluted by money: rents paid in money, military service paid for with money, wars fought with the aid of a \u00a0cross-border banking network stretching to Florence and Amsterdam. Once you accept that feudalism existed, and capitalism does, there\u2019s a big academic debate about what caused the collapse of feudalism and the rise of capitalism. Shakespeare managed to get to the essence of it without having knowledge of the terms feudalism and capitalism. Feudalism was a word invented to describe medieval society once it was over, by 17th century historians. As for capitalism, Shakespeare had seen only the earliest form of it, yet he described it well. In the comedies and tragedies \u2013 which are about the contemporary society the audience lived in \u2013 we are suddenly in a world of bankers, merchants, companies, mercenary soldiers and republics. The typical place in these plays is a prosperous trading city, not a castle. The typical hero is a person whose greatness is essentially bourgeois self-made, either through courage (Othello), humanist philosophy (Hamlet and Prospero) or knowledge of the law (Portia in The Merchant of Venice). But Shakespeare had no clue about where this was going to lead. He saw and described what a society that could print books, sail to the Americas, chart the heavens accurately was doing to the human character: empowering us with knowledge, yet leaving us susceptible to greed, passion, self-doubt and power-craziness on a scale unknown by the peasants and serfs of feudal Europe. Another 150 years would pass until merchant capitalism, based on trade, conquest and slavery, would give birth to industrial capitalism. For this reason, whenever I want to stop myself being too Marxist, I think about Shakespeare. Armed with a few history books and a profound humanism, he described the society around him with peerless insight, and tried to explain to his audience how they\u2019d got there. If you interrogate Shakespeare through his texts, and ask, what is different between the past and now, the implicit answer is \u201cideas\u201d. Human beings value each other more; love is more important than family duty; human values like truth, science and justice are worth dying for far more than race or nation. So Shakespeare is a great witness to the moment when one mode of production succeeds another. But we also need Marx. In a materialist view of history, what\u2019s different between feudalism and early merchant capitalism is not just \u201cideas\u201d. Social relations have changed. The market has begun to dictate how society functions. And at root, the change is driven by new technologies. For Marx the \u201cmodes of production\u201d concept led to a strict historical sequence: various pre-capitalist forms of society, where the rich get rich through legally authorised violence; then capitalism, where the rich get rich through technical innovation and the market; then you get communism, where the whole of humanity gets richer, morally and economically because there is abundance instead of scarcity. We know the original route to phase three, pursued in the Soviet Union, didn\u2019t work. But if we avoid mysticism, and assert simply that there must come a time when there is relative abundance, compared to the scarcity that has driven all previous economic models, then Marx is saying the same thing as John Maynard Keynes said in the 1930s: one day there will be enough goods to go around and the \u201ceconomic problem\u201d will be solved. What use is the mode of production concept today, with the neoliberal model of capitalism shattered, but nothing to take its place? Well, try describing the situation as a modern Shakespeare might: there\u2019s a great upheaval in social life. The modern Venice is the digital world, where people create and recreate realities for themselves in their social lives with an unprecedented level of freedom \u2013 which states and security apparatuses spend much time trying to\u00a0curtail. The modern merchant of this Venice is not part of the elite: he or she is the \u201cpro-sumer\u201d \u2013 the person who lets their apartment out on Airbnb or keeps a store on eBay. As to the economic mainspring: the one that ran capitalism has wound down. Populations are ageing; we\u2019ll soon be a whole northern hemisphere of Poloniuses. Productivity growth has declined. But alongside the ailing economy measured by GDP and turnover, there is another one, in which people create and exchange things freely. Only the existence of unparalleled tech monopolies, dedicated to preventing the abundance of free information, stops large amounts of the basic commodity of our age \u2013 information \u2013 being free. Put it like this and it is not hard to see the possibility of a \u201cpost-capitalist\u201d era \u2013 although the inability to see a path to it is what blights all modern social movements. Like Shakespeare, we may be at such an early stage of it that its final form cannot be discerned, but in the modern life of the networked individual we are seeing avatars of a future society just as clearly as the great protagonists in Shakespeare prefigured what greatness would look like in a market system.

The Barcelona striker was a notable absentee from the list when it was released last week, despite winning the Premier League\u2019s Player of the Year award and finishing as the top scorer with 31 goals for Liverpool last season. It was widely assumed that Su\u00e1rez\u2019s absence was down to his disciplinary problems that saw him banned for four months after biting Italy\u2019s Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, with Liverpool\u2019s captain Steven Gerrard describing the decision to omit the Uruguayan as \u201cpolitical\u201d. Su\u00e1rez was questioned about the snub for the first time in a interview with the Spanish radio station RAC1 on Monday night and hinted at his frustration but stopped short of criticising the governing body. \u201cEveryone brings it to attention, as Gerard Piqu\u00e9 said, and what he told me is that they voted me as the best player in the most difficult league in the world, or one of the most difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI was also the highest goalscorer of all of the European leagues.

A few metres away Dani Alves was talking. \u201cA truckload of criticism is going to land on us now,\u201d the defender remarked, while outside a small number of fans had gathered by the directors\u2019 box chanting that this is the \u201cworst board in history\u201d. A banner declaring much the same had already been removed from the stands. Barcelona had just been beaten for the second time in a week and failed to score at home for the first time in 56 games, even though they had been able to start with the forward line that so excited them: Leo Messi, Neymar and Luis Su\u00e1rez. The response to Su\u00e1rez\u2019s performances has been positive but the stats are stark: eight league wins out of eight without him, two defeats in a row with him. Now Su\u00e1rez makes his Champions League debut for Barcelona, against a former club, Ajax. He describes Ajax as a \u201cfootballing school\u201d that made him a real player after he had arrived from Uruguay via Groningen with \u201ctechnical failings\u201d, and the reception will be a warm one. \u201cIt will be a strange feeling, but I have to give everything for Barcelona,\u201d he said. He will have to: the job to be done is an important one. Barcelona need a win after a week of damaging reverses, with the team losing to Real Madrid and then Celta and the club losing a court case to the former president Joan Laporta, once again opening up divisions at a club with a terrible tendency for internecine conflict. Another defeat on Wednesday in Amsterdam would deepen their problems. It would leave Barcelona just one point in front of the Dutch side in second place in the group and would give PSG the chance to extend the lead over them to four points. Barcelona\u2019s prospects of winning the group would be slight and their chances of facing a big team in the knock-out stage increased \u2013 and right now, few believe that this team would progress against Europe\u2019s strongest sides. Confidence is waning. Bodies are too: the defender J\u00e9r\u00e9my Mathieu will be out for three weeks. Things have changed fast. \u201cTwo days ago [people said] Bar\u00e7a were the best,\u201d joked Johan Cruyff. \u201cWhen you\u2019re up there, the fall is harder.\u201d They had begun the season with eight wins and had not conceded a single goal in the league. But in a week they lost twice and conceded four times. What was a six-point lead over Real Madrid is now a two-point deficit. There had been doubts before \u2013 not least because they had been well beaten by Paris Saint-Germain in the French capital, a game many considered their only real test up to that point \u2013 but those had been muffled. Now the volume has been turned up. Barcelona had been unfortunate against Celta. They hit the frame of the goal four times, the Celta goalkeeper Sergio \u00c1lvarez made nine saves in total, and Luis Enrique had a point when he said that he would happily settle for them creating that many chances every match. But Javier Mascherano admitted that they had not played well and there was a sense of them losing their identity. The control had gone. One newspaper called them \u201cheadless chickens\u201d. The white noise that swirls round the board of directors, their legitimacy more questioned than ever, makes it worse. In terms of points, this is their worst league start in seven years and they have not been as low as fourth after 10 games for 20 years. There is a debate about the style again and the coach is under pressure. Su\u00e1rez admitted Barcelona had played more directly than they wanted to against Celta. The question is whether that is a one-off or a more systematic shift. There are other doubts, too: Gerard Piqu\u00e9 watched the Celta game from the stands; Sergio Busquets\u2019 form has dropped alarmingly over the past six months; Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez plays then does not; and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta is injured. Some failings are familiar: 96 corners this season have yielded no goals. Other debates are new. One focuses on the best way to fit in Su\u00e1rez. Messi seemed to be playing deeper, preparing for Su\u00e1rez\u2019s arrival. But when he came in, the Argentinian moved back up front, with the former Liverpool player on the right. Some are wondering what the point is, although Su\u00e1rez says he can play across the front \u201clike I did with Ajax and Liverpool\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem of Neymar, Messi and I, it\u2019s about all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is hard to accept when you get beaten but we know the demands that there are here: we know that it is normal for there be criticism after two defeats. But we have to forget the losses and improve.

It wasn\u2019t as if no one in the room was interested in politics; for an hour they had been arguing over tax, policing, municipal regulation, the difference between Democrats and Republicans, and what the Founding Fathers intended when they wrote the US constitution. It was just that the patrons of Club Ned were high up in Colorado\u2019s Rocky Mountains \u2013 8,420ft above sea level, and way above the clouds. And they said they were not going to vote for anything that didn\u2019t involve marijuana. The owners, Cheryl Fanelli, 47, and her husband David, 57, have dedicated their lives to politics; campaigning for \u2013 and sometimes drafting \u2013 more relaxed cannabis laws, an effort that reached its climax in Colorado this year when the legalisation of recreational marijuana came into force. Their cafe, which isn\u2019t permitted to sell marijuana but invites people to come and share on the premises, opened in March. Soon after, Colorado\u2019s political establishment made clear there would be no more Amsterdam-style marijuana cafes.  Yet without a cannabis-related measure (or candidate) in the state on the ballot on Tuesday, neither were prepared to drive the 16 miles down the mountain to Boulder to their nearest polling station.

I\u2019m not into the politics shit.\u201d He held aloft a hash brownie, said \u201cthe election won\u2019t affect this\u201d, smiled and plopped it in his mouth. I had come to Nederland to find out whether Colorado\u2019s marijuana smokers would be motivated to vote in the first election since cannabis was legalised in the state. They\u2019d headed to the polls in droves in 2012, when the vote for legalisation was held. On Sunday, I was in a Democratic field office in Lakewood, in the western suburbs of Denver, when the subject came up. Democratic Senator Mark Udall and congresswoman Diana DeGette were talking to party activists about why their voters had been so slow to submit their ballot papers. Republicans built a significant advantage in early returns. An older woman in glasses and a beanie hat advanced the theory that, post-legalisation, Democrats might be too high. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re having trouble getting out the vote,\u201d she joked.  Two days later, I visited Greenwerkz, a nearby recreational cannabis dispensary, opposite the municipal library in Edgewater.  The \u201cbud tenders\u201d behind the counter were Natasha Tavares, 25, who said she wasn\u2019t planning to vote and didn\u2019t know of any customers who were either, and Chris Conway, 32, who had his ballot with him, beside the sweet grass cookies and glass pipes. He wasn\u2019t voting in the crucial Senate race or any House elections. And like many pro-cannabis campaigners in Colorado, he was opposed to both the Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, and his Republican challenger, Bob Beauprez, who have criticised Colorado\u2019s legalisation. Instead, Conway was voting for just one candidate: libertarian gubernatorial candidate and Glendale Mayor Mike Dunafon \u2013 because he did a video with Wyclef Jean, Conway explained.            In search of more stoned voters, I drove west, into the mountains, to find the gaggle of smokers around a table at Club Ned.  Sat beside the Fanellis was Megan, 22, who was getting high in anticipation of the drug classes she had been mandated to attend after being caught by police driving while under the influence. She wasn\u2019t voting either. \u201cHow come, Mrs Megan! You are the youth of the country!\u201d said David. \u201cYour vote counts, didn\u2019t you know that?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what they keep saying,\u201d Megan said, looking bored. \u201cI thought it really did count when we had the elections over cannabis and stuff,\u201d David added. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if that was because we won that it mattered so much.\u201d On Tuesday, there were ballot measures to legalise recreational marijuana in Oregon and Alaska, a vote to decriminalise possession of the drug in the nation\u2019s capital, Washington, DC, and another measure to make the drug available for medical purposes in Florida. But the feeling at Club Ned was that with no marijuana on the ballot in Colorado, there was no point in going to the polls. Yet there was one voice of dissent: a tennis coach (and ex-professional player) from West Chester, Pennsylvania, who was sat beside his wife, a tax manager. The couple, red-eyed and smiling, were headed to Las Vegas, Nevada; all their belongings were in a two-door convertible parked nearby. They had factored in a two-day stop in their road trip to hang out at Club Ned. \u201cI\u2019ve only in the last couple of years got interested in cannabis and politics,\u201d the tennis coach said, as he insisted that voting should be made mandatory. He blamed apathy \u2013 among regular voters and stoners alike \u2013 on the US political system, which he said encouraged voters to pick candidates over parties. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to have a parliamentary system, but if we had that mindset, where we voted for the party that was least likely to screw up the country, then I think we\u2019d all be more inclined to vote,\u201d he said. He looked somewhat disappointed that the Fanellis were not using their vote. When Cheryl told him that all of the candidates \u201csuck\u201d, the tennis coach insisted one (the Democrat) is usually better than the other (the Republican). Besides, he added, voting was a privilege: \u201cPeople in half the world, it seems, are killing each other for that right.\u201d", "sentences": ["Soon after, Colorado\u2019s political establishment made clear there would be no more Amsterdam-style marijuana cafes."], "title": "With weed off the agenda, Colorado pot cafe patrons lose burning desire to vote", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/04/colorado-cannabis-cafe-midterm-election-vote", "tags": ["US midterm elections 2014", "Colorado", "US politics", "Cannabis", "Drugs"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-05T10:45:57Z", "article": "The bike path that connects the Amsterdam suburbs of Krommenie and Wormerveer is popular with both school children and commuters: around 2,000 cyclists ride its two lanes on an average day. But next week Krommenie\u2019s cycle path promises to become even more useful: on 12 November a 70-metre stretch will become the world\u2019s first public road with embedded solar panels. Costing around \u20ac3m (\u00a32.4m) and funded mostly by the local authority, the road is made up of rows of crystalline silicon solar cells, encased within concrete and covered with a translucent layer of tempered glass. A non-adhesive finish and a slight tilt are meant to help the rain wash off dirt and thus keep the surface clean, guaranteeing maximum exposure to sunlight. Since the path cannot be adjusted to the position of the sun, the panels produce roughly 30% less energy than those fixed on to roofs. Nonetheless, when the path is extended to 100 metres in 2016, its creators hope that it will produce enough energy to power three households. The Netherlands\u2019 TNO research institute, which developed the concept behind the solar bicycle path, think the potential of their idea doesn\u2019t stop there. Sten de Wit of the institute told the Guardian that up to 20% of the Netherlands\u2019 140,000km of road could potentially be adapted, helping to power anything from traffic lights to electric cars. Tests have seen the solar panel units successfully carry the weight of heavy vehicles such as tractors. While Krommenie will become the first community in the world with a publicly accessible stretch of solar road, the idea of using existing road infrastructure to harvest solar energy is gaining momentum across the globe. Two US engineers, Idaho couple Julie and Scott Brusaw, have been developing solar panelling units for road use since 2006. In 2009, their company Solar Roadways received a contract from America\u2019s Federal Highway Administration to build a prototype. In March this year, the Brusaws replaced their own parking lot with solar-panelled units, and thanks to a popular viral video, they have raised $2.2m (\u00a31.4m) to put their design into production. If all the roads in the US were converted to solar roadways, the Solar Roadways website claims, the country would generate three times as much energy as it currently uses and cut greenhouse gases by 75%.", "sentences": ["The bike path that connects the Amsterdam suburbs of Krommenie and Wormerveer is popular with both school children and commuters: around 2,000 cyclists ride its two lanes on an average day."], "title": "World's first solar cycle lane opening in the Netherlands", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/05/worlds-first-solar-cycle-lane-opening-in-the-netherlands", "tags": ["Solar power", "Netherlands", "Renewable energy", "Environment", "Cycling", "Energy", "Europe", "Life and style", "Cities"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-05T11:00:10Z", "article": "There is no prouder monument to the history of Shetland than Lerwick Town Hall. An inimitably Victorian fusion of Gothic and Scots baronial, its true glory is its stained glass windows. Downstairs, emblazoned on one of them, appears a quotation from the Roman historian Tacitus: \u201cDispecta est et Thule\u201d \u2013 \u201cAnd even Thule was glimpsed\u201d. The allusion is to the circumnavigation of Britain in AD84 by a Roman war fleet; and whether \u201cThule\u201d does indeed refer to Shetland, or else to Fair Isle, or even to Faroe, it concisely conveys the sense of achievement felt by those who had sighted it. The northern Ocean, it seemed to the Romans, stood at a forbidding remove from everything that made life bearable: sunshine, wine, olive oil. Its slate-grey waters, icy and teeming with monsters, marked the boundaries of the world itself. A thousand years on, though, and Shetland had come to serve navigators, not as a frontier, but as a crossroads. Climb the stairs of Lerwick Town Hall to the magnificent chamber hall on the first floor, and you will find, illustrated in best Victorian stained glass, a pantheon of Viking heroes. There bristles Olaf Tryggvasson, the pirate who brought Christianity to Norway, and Harald Hardrada, the Norwegian who perished in 1066 making a land grab on England, and a whole host of other pirates, explorers and sea kings. They serve as a reminder of Shetland\u2019s role as a service station for Vikings travelling the sea lanes between Scandinavia and Iceland, and of how, throughout the middle ages, the island was ruled, not from Scotland, but from Norway. The North Sea, no longer the final frontier, had become a thoroughfare. Michael Pye\u2019s study of how this phenomenon came about, and of its momentous long-term consequences, rides the crest of a much broader historiographical wave. Ever since Fernand Braudel, in 1949, published his groundbreaking work The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, historians have been alert to the role played by seas in the development of civilisation. The past few years have witnessed a particular efflorescence. Monumental studies by David Abulafia and Cyprian Broodbank have continued the Braudelian tradition of tracing the longue dur\u00e9e in the Mediterranean, while Barry Cunliffe has been doing the same for Europe\u2019s Atlantic seaboard. Now, in The Edge of the World, Pye turns the spotlight on to the life and traffic of the medieval North Sea. His justification for doing so is twofold: that hitherto it has been neglected by historians in favour of more glamorous stretches of water; and that its history matters. \u201cThis cold, grey sea in an obscure time,\u201d declares Pye in his introduction, \u201cmade the modern world possible.\u201d In that sense, the title of his book is ironic. The accomplishments of those who lived on the shores of the North Sea in the middle ages did indeed place them, not on the edge of the world, but in the very mainstream of European civilisation. Some of these are well-known: be it Bede, devising the calendar that we still use today, or the merchants of Antwerp and Amsterdam, preparing the way for modern capitalism in their bourses and counting houses. Others, though, are less obvious; and it is the measure of Pye\u2019s achievement that he can breathe life into the traders of seventh-century Frisia or the beguines of late-medieval Flanders as well as into his more celebrated subjects. The Lowlands, in particular, emerge from his study as having as much claim to be the womb of modernity as anywhere in medieval Europe. From fashion to feminism, from money to marriage customs, Pye makes a convincing case that they pioneered them all. Not, of course, that this is entirely what the book sets out to prove. Pye\u2019s ambitions for it are altogether broader: for what he wishes to demonstrate is not merely that the various peoples bordering the North Sea contributed towards the forging of the modern, but that it was the North Sea itself which, in the words of his subtitle, \u201cmade us who we are\u201d. Clearly, as the representation of Viking luminaries in the council chamber of Lerwick reminds us, there were times when the North Sea did indeed constitute a lake, and it can make sense to think of the various peoples along its shores as constituting a civilisation distinct from the rest of Europe. Throughout the early middle ages, there remained a self-sufficiency about them that not all the countervailing attractions of Latin Christendom could overcome. Even in England, where Northumbrians such as Bede and Wilfrid looked to Rome as the lodestar of their church, the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms defied absorption into Charlemagne\u2019s empire, and spoke a language that aligned them more closely with the pagan Frisians and Danes than with the Latin-speakers of Christian Francia. To that extent, then, the Viking firestorm that swept over the British Isles in the ninth century marked less a rupture with what had gone before than an intensification of it. By the year 1000, it was not only the North Sea that shared a common culture, but Ireland, Iceland, and even a few precarious outposts in North America. The apogee of this trend came in the reign of the Danish king Cnut, who dominated both Scandinavia and Great Britain, and all the shipping lanes in between. Remarkably, though, Pye does not even mention his sea empire; nor does he trace the twin processes which, over the course of the 11th century, saw the realms of the North Sea drawn decisively into the orbit of Latin Christendom. First, there was the conquest of England by the Normans: erstwhile Vikings who had evolved to become French-speaking chevaliers, and whose cultural loyalties were not to Norway or Denmark, but to France. Secondly, combined with the emergence of an increasingly assertive papacy, there was the final defeat of paganism in Scandinavia. By the 1070s, Gregory VII could seriously attempt to bully the Danish king into holding his realm as a fief from himself; in 1164, Alexander III confirmed the Norwegian warlord Olaf Haraldsson, who had died in battle against Cnut\u2019s forces and been the half- brother of Harald Hardrada, as a saint of the Roman Church. The North Sea had turned decidedly Latin. Pye, though, touches on none of this \u2013 and it severely unbalances his book. The focus on the North Sea that is such a feature of his early chapters becomes increasingly blurred. Descriptions of the Mongols, or the universities of Bologna and Paris, are all very interesting \u2013 but what they have to do with Pye\u2019s theme is not immediately obvious. The problem he faces is as simple as it is unacknowledged: so successful was the process of conquest and evangelisation by which Latin Christendom expanded into its northern periphery that what had been distinctive about the North Sea in the early medieval period was increasingly lost. England ended up an imitation of France; Scotland an imitation of England; only in Orkney and Shetland did anyone give much thought any longer to the Norwegians across the waters. None of which prevents Pye\u2019s book from being hugely enjoyable; and whenever he touches on the Lowlands, or on the Hansa, the great league of merchants whose operations stretched from London to Novgorod, he does recapture his focus to a degree. Certainly, the claims he makes for the North Sea are sufficiently stimulating to keep the reader\u2019s interest; the anecdotes he tells, and the details he marshals, doubly so. Grey the waters of the North Sea may be; but Pye has successfully dyed them with a multitude of rich colours. \u2022 Tom Holland\u2019s In the Shadow of the Sword is published by Abacus.

But only now are people starting to listen to him. In the fall of 2011, the esteemed Columbia University climate scientist published a prophetic report estimating how much damage New York\u2019s subway system would suffer in the event of a major storm. One year later, when hurricane Sandy brought the Hudson river pouring into subway stations citywide, that report proved eerily accurate. The press promptly named Jacob the Cassandra of NYC Flooding \u2013 a man whose valid, persistent warnings had gone unheeded for years.      Klaus Jacob.    \u201cYou can talk forever, but there\u2019s nothing like an existential experience like Sandy to change our lives,\u201d Jacob told me. \u201cThat\u2019s when people suddenly remember hearing what you said.\u201d Jacob and I met at Columbia on a fittingly rainy day. He had agreed to explain how and whether New York City is protecting us from the next big storm for this series, Stormproofing the City. Are we safe? No. Of course we\u2019re not safe. It\u2019s only two years after Sandy, and the $50bn provided by Congress for post-Sandy resilience funding is only gradually trickling through the pipelines, from the federal through the state to the local communities. [Reporter\u2019s note: less than a quarter of the funding has been paid out.] It\u2019ll take at least another several years before that money is spent. The MTA is just getting their money now. What took almost two years to write a check? When the city finally receives the funding, will it be meaningfully spent?  That\u2019s the big question. By and large, government agencies and the private sector are doing more rebuilding than pro-building for the future. Some projects can actually make it worse for future generations. Why? Well, there are fundamentally three ways to adapt to climate change and sea level rising.   One is protect: keep the water out. The second is accommodate the water. Invite it into the city. Make the city as immune as you can from the presence of it. The third, and the hottest potato politically, is strategic resettlement. Strategic resettlement is the most sustainable here, because New York has topography that other cities don\u2019t. We have places like the Greenwood Cemetery that are 220 feet above sea level, where nobody lives except the dead! And we put the living in the water.  What are some of New York\u2019s resilience measures that actually create risk for the future?  Take, for instance, the Big U, which came from the Housing of Urban Development\u2019s Rebuild by Design competition. It builds a levy and dam system into a nicely designed park, a multipurpose structure.      Rebuild by Design\u2019s \u2018Big U\u2019 flood defense scheme for Lower Manhattan, which won $335m of funding. Visualization: Big Architects.    The city should be proud of the project. Except \u2026 it has a fixed height. As the sea level rises, you need ever smaller storms to overcome it. It\u2019s exactly New Orleans\u2019 problem during Katrina. People think, \u2018We have this Big U, we\u2019re safe.\u2019 But you\u2019re building up risk behind the U until it becomes dysfunctional. I\u2019m not saying it will leak during the first ten years, but the sea level rise calculated is out to the 2050s. What about the 2080s? 2100? You just postpone the problem for future generations. How can you get people to care about 2100? It seems so far away.    I don't understand why we are almost unethical towards our children\u2019s children.    I\u2019m not saying we have to build the city today for 2100. I\u2019m only saying we shouldn\u2019t take measures now that become problems for the people living in 2100. The whole basic concept of sustainability is to avoid intergenerational inequities and injustices. We throw around the word, but we\u2019re violating that principle. The city has certainly done many wonderful things to become greener. But I don\u2019t understand why we are so almost unethical towards our children\u2019s children. So tell me what the second way to adapt to rising sea levels \u2013 accommodation to water \u2013 would look like. We could make downtown Manhattan like it was during the Dutch time \u2013 Broad Street was a canal. It had boats and ships. Let\u2019s open it up again and let Water Street be Water Street and Canal Street be Canal Street. Venice on the Hudson!     An early detailed city map of New Amsterdam \u2013 today\u2019s downtown Manhattan \u2013 from 1660. Image: Wikimedia    So you\u2019d then have to create submersible infrastructure for electric, gas, and communications \u2013 but we lay telephone cables across the ocean. We\u2019ve run subways under the East River for over 100 years. Use the same technology! Build high lines for automobiles \u2013 raising normal traffic 30 feet will last you a couple of centuries. If a storm like Sandy was to happen again tomorrow, would it be different? No, it would be almost the same. Take the MTA: they recently received $300m from the Federal Transit Administration. It will take a few years to implement that. And what\u2019s the money for? Stormproofing five stations downtown. That\u2019s it.  What\u2019s missing is the political will to do a rational assessment of costs and benefits. It\u2019s so clearly worthwhile to incur some debt now to avoid downstream losses. But there\u2019s something wired wrongly in our brains \u2013 we like to win lotteries, not put a dollar down now to save four later. We need a lot more Katrinas and earthquakes and storms before we get smarter. How much of the efforts here in New York reflect other cities in the US? Other cities, other problems, other solutions \u2026 or no solutions. San Francisco is looking carefully, though they worry more about earthquakes. Kings County in Seattle is doing nice things. A group in New Orleans is working toward letting the water in \u2013 a laudable effort \u2013 though I\u2019m not sure what chances they have. Houston has taken care of its urban flash flooding, but there are big problems with sea level rising there in the future.  And Miami: forget it. The highest place you can live in Miami is only 18ft above sea level. Miami, no.    Miami, forget it. In 100 or 200 years, I\u2019m not sure whether anybody will know where Miami is.    Why? Even if you believed in protection, it wouldn\u2019t work there. Miami sits on sponge-like limestone, which is worse than swiss cheese: the holes are all connected to each other. If you build a dam or levy on it, the water just flows underneath. In 100 or 200 years, I\u2019m not sure whether anybody will know where Miami is. Some of the things you\u2019re saying are scary and may be hard for people to hear. It shouldn\u2019t be scary. Why not? It provides incredible opportunities to fix problems that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to dream of. We can build entire new cities, or amendments to cities, in the way we want them. What\u2019s so scary about that? I mean, look. I grew up as a young boy just when world war two ended. It was a miserable time. Who ended up renewing all its infrastructure and rebuilding? Japan and Germany. It all turned into an opportunity.   stormproofing takeaways box   As I continue my interviews [in this series], what sorts of answers should I take with a grain of salt? Always question if you hear someone say that the post-Sandy recovery was a success. No. It was not a success. 90% of applicants for the city\u2019s Build it Back program haven\u2019t seen any financial assistance. Come on.  What amazes me are the proposals that haven\u2019t been tabled \u2013 like Seaport City, which supports new luxury housing at the waterfront, in harm\u2019s way. They argue that if you build it high enough, it\u2019ll protect the neighborhoods behind it. Give me a break. That may be true for a couple of decades, but fundamentally it\u2019s a misinvestment. The real estate sector is extraordinarily influential in this city. The mayor\u2019s office tends to be more or less beholden to it. What I\u2019m saying goes against what they\u2019ve been preaching for 30 years: that a waterfront apartment is a good investment. What else needs to be done to protect New York from future storms? We still have no serious plan for the people in the Rockaways and Red Hook. We do have temporary walls in Red Hook, and I like that they don\u2019t pretend to be permanent. They look like the Band-Aid that they are. But you can\u2019t wear a Band-Aid for long, particularly when the wound keeps bleeding. You have to do something about it.  Would places like the Rockaways and Red Hook benefit from your third way to adapt \u2013 \u201cstrategic relocation\u201d? Yes. Let\u2019s create waterfront parks and start to resettle the higher grounds. It takes 50\u2013100 years to shape a new city. We have to start putting financial instruments in place sometime.     Debris sits on a still-closed Staten Island beach area damaged by flooding from hurricane Sandy, with Lower Manhattan and One World Trade Center in the background. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images    What are financial instruments? We have examples of things that work. NGOs go to farmers in upstate New York and say: \u201cYou stay and farm as long as you want, but if you want to quit, let us buy the land. Don\u2019t sell it to developers. We\u2019ll ensure that it stays farmland.\u201d We could go to people in the Rockaways and say, \u201cIf you\u2019re ready to leave, sell to us, the public. We\u2019ll help you find a new place to settle.\u201d Is there anyone else I should talk to that could help me understand how New York is being stormproofed? Ask the Federal Reserve how to finance something like resettlement \u2013 how to make public bonds, how to have Goldman Sachs put a little brains into it.  Also call [director of the mayor\u2019s office of recovery and resiliency] Dan Zarilli. He thinks I\u2019m his nemesis, but he\u2019s smart as hell. I\u2019m always holding him accountable for short-term thinking with Seaport City. Sure, I don\u2019t have to deal with politics and the real estate industry \u2013 I don\u2019t envy his position. But that doesn\u2019t make him right. Last question: what keeps you up at night? My sleep is very good. Ok. What\u2019s your biggest fear? That we will muddle along and lose time that we could have spent so much more productively. Yes, we are of different minds politically, but Mother Earth doesn\u2019t care whether you\u2019re rich or poor or what state boundary you live on. And unless we find consensus that we\u2019re in trouble, we\u2019ll be in trouble. This interview is part of a series called Stormproofing the City.

He\u2019s tied the previous record of 71 set by Spanish footballer, Ra\u00fal. But how does Messi compare with the other top scorers? It has taken the Argentinian player 90 appearances to reach 71 goals \u2013 Ra\u00fal took 142 matches to reach the same number. Real Madrid\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo is just behind the pair with a tally of 70 goals.  That gives Messi a terrifying 0.79 goals per game, meaning he will probably score in roughly four out of every five Champions League matches \u2013 a rate that is considerably higher than both Ronaldo\u2019s (nearly two out of three) and Ra\u00fal\u2019s (one out of two).        It would probably frustrate the intensely competitive Ronaldo to hear it but Messi has reached this level of goalscoring much earlier in his career than his two closest competitors.  At 27 years old, he is six years younger than Ra\u00fal was when he scored his record-setting goal against Internazionale for FC Schalke in 2011. Ronaldo is currently 29.  Despite this, Messi scored his first Champions League goal in 2005, which was two years before Ronaldo got one for Manchester United. A product of the Barcelona youth academy, the Argentinian was just 18 when he scored against Greek team Panathinaikos.        His next was against Werder Bremen the following season and his third the season after that in a match with Lyon.  This staggered introduction gives him a lopsided trajectory which shows the Argentinian has really got into his stride in recent seasons \u2013 a decent indication that Ra\u00fal\u2019s part in the record will not stand for much longer.            Although this does come with a caveat for those defending Ra\u00fal. The Champions League has changed massively in format in the years in which these players have reached their prime so it is not quite a like-for-like comparison.  For Ra\u00fal\u2019s first few seasons in the competition, just 24 of the elite teams in Europe were involved in the group stage while it is now 32. Football clubs have also taken on a more attacking mentality in recent years, which may be the reason behind the upward trend in the number of goals scored per game in the competition.     2014-15 so far    Nevertheless, this is another amazing record for Lionel Messi, who is not only now impossible but also the benchmark for all forwards in the European league system.

The US, in particular, is on a roll: in the past month alone, same-sex marriage has been legalised in 13 states \u2013 including the Pacific paradise of Hawaii. These locations join France, Brazil, New Zealand and the markedly less tropical UK. Now, same-sex couples can start dreaming of exotic ceremonies: beachside in Honolulu, perhaps; a classical reception in Paris, or an Elvis-themed shindig in Vegas. Nowhere is the buzz felt more than at the gay-owned and operated Vivas Las Vegas wedding chapel, which has already performed 50 same-sex marriages and had over 200 inquiries from around the world since it was legalised in Nevada last month. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that same-sex couples have the same rights,\u201d says Brian Mills, general manager at the chapel. \u201cNot only from an economic standpoint, but from a moral and social one as well.\u201d For Neal Broverman, editor-in-chief of gay travel magazine Out Traveler, this is all part of a \u201csea change\u201d going on right now with gay wedding destinations: \u201cTen years ago, people just did commitment ceremonies, but now there\u2019s marriage equality in all these places where we were previously left out of the conversation.\u201d     An Elvis-themed ceremony in Las Vegas.

New research this week from Out Now Global \u2013 which offers LGBT training for tourism staff and has also ranked the top LGBT destinations for 2015 \u2013 values the LGBT travel market at $200bn a year. And as Broverman says, legalising same-sex marriage makes a \u201chuge difference\u201d to the way a destination is perceived in general. \u201cOur readers are very conscious of places that are resistant to LGBT rights,\u201d he says. \u201cLGBT people stay on top of which places are friendly and when they hear somewhere\u2019s opened up, they see it as a place to go.\u201d John Tanzella, president of the International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA), says there is a huge amount of hype in the US: \u201cAs destinations open up for weddings, people jump on them, and hotels and restaurants fill up. It will settle down, but there\u2019s a very large LGBT community, and they want to support the people who support them.\u201d Some are cynical about destinations courting the \u201cpink pound\u201d but less interested in LGBT rights, but Tanzella feels the process is ultimately positive: \u201cIf anything, it builds bridges and creates a dialogue in the destination about the whole LGBT community.\u201d And the number of new wedding destinations is set to continue into the new year, when Florida is likely to legalise same-sex marriage. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge destination,\u201d says Broverman. \u201cI think people are really excited about it opening up in Florida, with Key West and Orlando.

The German polymath Goethe would have approved of that because on his first journey to Italy, in autumn 1786, he had barely crossed the Alps before he started enthusing about the food. He then enthused about painting, sculpture, ruins and, ultimately, the entire classical achievement. His colleagues of the Enlightenment were happy to concur and ever since then we have tended to draw a line through history that makes us the heirs of ancient Rome and beyond it, Greece. Michael Pye thinks we owe a greater debt elsewhere and has written a book to support this idea. A conventional view of history has the dark ages beginning with the decline of Rome in the 400s and the lights not coming back on until the Renaissance a millennium later. But it has become increasingly fashionable to wonder whether there wasn\u2019t something going on in all that time, and Michael Pye is certainly not the first to shine a light into the gloom. But no book I have read, nor any that I spotted in Pye\u2019s 50 pages of references, has looked at the available evidence in the way it is presented here. The title, however, should more exactly refer to \u201cthe edge of the Roman world\u201d for this is where the North Sea sits, in many places well beyond the imperial frontier. And that is important to Pye\u2019s thesis for he claims that it was those people who lived beyond the imperial reach who created the circumstances and the tools for what we consider modernity. It starts with the Frisians, with a change of climate and the fall of Rome. Pliny the Younger had mentioned that there were people on the edge of the world who lived cut off from the mainland by marshes. They were sea people, he announced, and all they had in their lives was fish, so they were not worth conquering. They were sea people for a reason, because in that region, at that time, it was quicker to travel on water than land. Seven hundred years later, the bishop of nearby Utrecht was similarly dismissive. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d Pye writes, \u201cbetween the writing of those two accounts the Frisians reinvented all the links and ties across the North Sea.\u201d The challenge to accepted dark age theories implicit in that sentence runs through the book and is usually followed, as in this case, by something even more surprising: the Frisians, Pye tells us, \u201creinvented money\u201d. And that reinvention was something of a revolution, and one that speaks directly to us, because the way they used money, instead of barter or a straight equivalent in precious metals, required both buyer and seller to accept the abstract idea of value. And once you had abstract values, you had mathematics, and then it wasn\u2019t long before there was a market. And once there was a market, as we all know in our post-crash world, there was the possibility of leverage, of fiddling values\u00a0and exploiting the market. The Edge of the World does several things at once. It tells some of the history of the North Sea and its peoples. It traces the development of several things that came out of that sea, among them the idea that one could shape the world to one\u2019s needs, that women could make key choices in their lives, that law was power and, by extension, that lawmakers and practitioners were powerful. And it challenges the notion that we owe our world to the ancients and the Renaissance. \u201cWe are not on the margins of history any more,\u201d Pye concludes after looking at the golden age of cities such as Antwerp and Amsterdam, pointing to \u201cthe changes of mind that made our world possible\u201d. All of which invites the question: are we the heirs of ancient Rome, of the Mediterranean world, or of not-so-ancient Frisia and the North Sea? The argument here is clearly the latter and if there is a problem with the assertion it is that it has been made too loudly, too eloquently. Pye draws on an extraordinary range of sources, from an essay on the emergence of bathing culture in Scarborough to a study of Viking references in medieval Irish literature. The Venerable Bede has a walk-on part, as too do Charlemagne and Cosimo de\u2019 Medici, whose Renaissance rooms were \u201cwrapped in Flemish taste\u201d. More fascinating are the voices of less-known characters and Pye delights in bringing them back to the light, among them Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, and Katelijne Vedelaer, a pretty Beguine from 14th-century Bruges who fought off wealthy abductors and insisted on her rights. Doubts remain about the argument \u2013 it would be good to know more about how these developments clashed with or complemented the achievements of the Arabs \u2013 but in spite of that the result is more lasagne than pickled herring, a multilayered, complicated, dense book that demands time to read and be digested but rewards by giving one plenty to chew on.

So did his team-mates Sergi Roberto and Mart\u00edn Montoya. So too did Sandro Rosell, Joan Laporta and Josep Maria Bartomeu, Barcelona presidents past, present and probably future. Pep Guardiola also had one. Barcelona\u2019s players had travelled back from Almer\u00eda the previous night, where they had come from behind to win 2-1, while Guardiola had flown in from Munich. Just after midday on Sunday he appeared at the Institut CIC, one of 1,317 polling stations in Catalonia. He was among the two million people who turned out to vote in the Catalan \u201creferendum\u201d, around 35% of those eligible. There were two questions on the paper. The first asked if Catalonia should be a state. The second asked: if so, should it be an independent state? An estimated 80.7% voted yes to both questions; 10% voted yes to the first and no to the second; 4.5% voted no to both. The Spanish government described the vote as \u201cantidemocratic\u201d, \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201cuseless.\u201d They had refused to negotiate, constitutional courts had first blocked a referendum then blocked a formal \u201cconsultation\u201d, and those opening polling booths could theoretically be charged. But a vote went ahead anyway \u2013 a kind of statement turned leverage turned opinion poll turned dress rehearsal, from which those opposed to independence largely abstained. The question this morning is: what now? It is a question that has been asked often and pointedly about Barcelona, the football club. On one level, it seems odd to elevate football to such a significant status when the independence process, if it does indeed continue now, would pose so many other huge questions. But it is logical enough. This is far from insignificant; when it comes to issues that have a tangible impact on people\u2019s lives, what happens to their football team matters. And like it or not, and many do not, sport and politics do mix. On Sunday afternoon, one Catalan player celebrated a goal with his tongue wedged in his cheek and a t-shirt under his shirt saying: \u201cToday\u2019s goal is for you, [Spanish PM Mariano] Rajoy\u201d And so the question is asked. If Catalonia did at some stage become independent, what would happen to Barcelona? Could they still play in the Spanish league? Should they be allowed to? That the question is often a loaded one is reflected in the fact that it\u2019s repeatedly asked of Barcelona and comparatively rarely asked of Espanyol. If Espanyol are usually seen as a club caught up in a process not of their making, Barcelona are usually seen as agents of it. While Barcelona\u2019s commitment to political Catalanism is more shifting and nuanced than is sometimes imagined, the two clubs\u2019 histories and identities are different. Soon after the civil war, Marca wrote of Espa\u00f1ol as a club run by people \u201cwell known for their [Spanish] patriotism\u201d and of Barcelona as an institution that \u201cused sport as a mouthpiece for an insufferable region.\u201d But Espanyol, whose name, contrary to the usual assumptions, was not chosen as a Spanish rejection of Catalanism or Catalonia, have used the Catalan spelling for almost 20 years and insist that if Barcelona is more than a club, so is Catalonia. Yesterday, their president Joan Collet voted too. During their game against Villarreal there were Catalan flags at the stadium. But there were Spanish flags too, and possibly more of them. Barcelona\u2019s alignment with Catalanism is less ambiguous (but still contains ambiguities) and the club boasts a social and political power that is gigantic. That is something they have embraced too, of course, through the idea of being more than a club. One member of the Catalan parliament, a Catalan separatist exiled in the UK for many years, tells how his father always said: \u201cthe day there are chants for independence at the Camp Nou is the day we will get independence.\u201d For the last two years, on 17 minutes and 14 seconds, those chants have gone round the stadium; they have simply not been carried off by the wind. But this process has also put Barcelona in an awkward position, one that forces them to confront uncomfortable issues. So mostly they have chosen not to confront them at all; the difference between the current board and that led by Laporta, whose convictions were far clearer, is striking. There has been silence, a veneer of apoliticism, an implicit wish that the trouble would just go away. It took the club a long time to publicly back the Catalans\u2019 right to have the vote. And a week ago, Barcelona refused to authorise the unfurling of a banner that declared Catalonia Europe\u2019s next state. Meanwhile, the sponsor on their shirts and all over the stadium reads \u201cQatar\u201d. Their focus is increasingly international; both in terms of signings and supporters. Some accuse them of failing to take a braver, more determined political stance, more in line with their historic identity. For these critics, the Catalan question became another example of the deterioration of their club\u2019s identity, something that extends from the court room all the way to the pitch. Guardiola\u2019s brief return this weekend only served to heighten that feeling; his Sunday night meeting with Gerard Piqu\u00e9, revealed by a fan with a phone, even more so. Within the club, they say they are apolitical; they cannot lead in this process and must merely follow the will of the people. The Catalan people, that is. Barcelona\u2019s current board say they have not chosen this situation, nor contributed to it. It is an argument that is only partly true and passivity and caution leaves them in a kind of vacuum, while changing little on a popular level. Elsewhere in Spain, for many the inevitable assumption remains: Barcelona are pushing for independence, using their privileged position for political means. \u201cY Viva Espa\u00f1a\u201d is more regularly sung at them against a backdrop of Spain flags than it is chanted at Espanyol. Players are reminded that \u201cSpain is your nation\u201d and their commitment to the national team is questioned. This weekend cameras caught an Almer\u00eda fan shouting at them: \u201cSpain\u2019s so lovely ... and you want to leave?!\u201d As shouts go, that was one of the nice ones. And so the question becomes a threat: \u201cIf you go, where are you going to play? Push for this and pay the consequences. If you want to leave, leave ... and you can leave the league too. See how you like that\u201d. You can almost hear Harry Enfield: \u201cIs that what you want? Cos that\u2019s what\u2019ll happen.\u201d At an institutional level, Barcelona have not answered the question publicly. They have preferred not even to ask it. Publicly, the same was true of the Spanish footballing authorities but as the issue grew and the date of the referendum came closer, the president of the league Javier Tebas came out and said that if Catalonia became independent, Barcelona could not play in the league. For the first time, the issue was out there, taken on by a figure of power. And his statement was stark too. Tebas\u2019s argument was ostensibly a legal one: the law governing the participation in professional sport in the country only allows for one exception: the only non-Spanish teams allowed to play in Spanish competition are Andorran ones. No other non-Spanish state is mentioned, thus no other state\u2019s teams can take part. Tebas presented the law as his trump card but it was a semantic sleight of hand: of course the law does not contemplate the inclusion of Catalan clubs as non-Spanish exceptions. How could it if Catalonia does not exist (yet)? Why would it if Catalan clubs count as Spanish (still)? After independence, it might be a different matter: then and only then would it be contemplated in law. Sport will not be the only sphere in which laws will be re-worded and terms redefined. The idea that Spain\u2019s sports laws could not be changed in the event of a new political reality that would require the constitution to be changed is clearly flawed. Tebas is a former member of the far right Fuerza Nueva and his words should probably be read not merely as a response to an insistent question but also as a warning, an attempt to discourage independence, using the political power football provides; being president of the league gives him considerable leverage. He admitted that as a Spanish patriot he could not remain silent and his words were surely designed not just to reflection a legal reality but to impact upon a political one. Yet he remains the president of the league \u2013 official title: the Professional Football League, not the Spanish Football League \u2013 and he still would do after independence. But were independence to become a reality, his priorities would shift and his position might change. The league depends on the law, of course, but it is a law that could be modified and the league would still be a private body. And it is in no one\u2019s interests to lose Barcelona (or Espanyol), least of all Tebas\u2019s. TV deals, sponsorship and attendance would be hit hard. A league already dominated by two teams would become dominated by one and, loathe though they are to admit it, that would not even suit the one. Barcelona and Espanyol would be hit harder. (Even if, again, the focus is invariably on the former not the latter.) There\u2019s a belief at Barcelona, born of their size and importance and the arrogance that goes with it, that they will be OK. In the long run, they probably will be. Espanyol, largely forgotten, might actually be hurt more. Barcelona will not lack for suitors and the most important of them would surely be Spain, unless political pressure outside of football post-independence blocks that \u2013 punishment or national coherence, depending on your point of view. The alternatives are not good for anyone. A European league is not yet a viable exit, not as a replacement to a Spanish one, while accommodation in Portugal, say, or France is far from simple. And an independent Catalan would satisfy no one. The third best team in Catalonia is Girona, average attendance: 5,500. The fourth best are Barcelona B. Talking points     Jordi Alba celebrates with Luis Su\u00e1rez after scoring his team\u2019s second goal. Photograph: Denis Doyle/Getty Images    \u2022 At least Barcelona would be top of a Catalan league. This morning they sit second in the Spanish league, two points behind Real Madrid. Which would not necessarily be a major problem, but they were six points ahead of Madrid not so long ago and the sensation is that they are slipping further away. Eleven weeks into the season, things still aren\u2019t right; in fact, they may even be getting worse. While on the other side of the great divide, their rivals look unstoppable. On Saturday night, Gareth Bale returned for Real Madrid, with some wondering whether he really deserved to come back into the team in place of Isco \u2026 so, eight minutes later he had scored. It was the first of another five for Madrid, against a Rayo Vallecano team that was actually very good, and Real are now on course for 145 league goals for the season. Keep up this pace and Ronaldo alone will get 66. He collected the Golden Shoe before the game and has now scored in every home league game for a year. Meanwhile, Barcelona went a goal down 36 minutes into their match at Almer\u00eda, giving them a then aggregate score over the previous 212 minutes of football of 0-5, and leaving them on course for a third successive defeat. Barcelona\u2019s line up cost \u20ac191m \u2013 and that was just the players who started on the bench. So Luis Enrique decided that he had better play them after all. Neymar and Luis Su\u00e1rez were sent on and not long after so was Xavi. \u201cSu\u00e1rez to the rescue,\u201d said the headline on the cover of El Mundo Deportivo. The Uruguayan was superb. He hit the bar, set Lionel Messi up to hit the bar, put another shot just wide, and provided two excellent assists for Neymar and Jordi Alba to give Barcelona a 2-1 win. \u201cHow well you laid it off, Luisito,\u201d Alba tweeted. His finish on the other hand was fortunate, the ball squeezing in off his studs. Luis Enrique admitted that it was Barcelona\u2019s worst performance of the season. The worrying thing for his team was that it was no one-off; they have hit the post seven times in their last two games but that does not take away from the fact that they do not convince at the moment. Barcelona lost against Madrid and Celta, and were fortunate against Eibar before that. There is a sense of them losing their identity and losing control. On the way back from Amsterdam after playing Ajax their plane broke down. The players went back to a hotel while the staff had to stay at the airport. Photos showed the sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta sprawled across a couple of chairs, asleep. It felt telling, somehow. An eloquent comment. This weekend, wrote Santi Gim\u00e9nez in AS, they had beaten their own manager; they had won in spite of the plan not because of it. If there is a plan. Not for the first time, Luis Enrique had to call on Xavi to help rescue him. Only one outfield Barcelona line up has started two games all season and one of those was in the league, the other in the Champions League, so they had different goalkeepers. Even the most-repeated back four has only played together three times. Gerard Piqu\u00e9 started another game on the bench, the finger of blame pointing his way when it is not his fault, and was sent to warm up, even as the third sub went on. If that smelt of sadism, his meeting with Guardiola on Sunday night raises the prospect of him departing and might at least be a timely reminder of what Barcelona would lose if he did. Sergio Busquets looks lost, space opening up around him. Javier Mascherano is still, bafflingly, at centre-back. Cesc F\u00e0bregas is at Chelsea and Toni Kroos is at Madrid. And Messi hasn\u2019t scored for three weeks. \u201cEverything in life takes time,\u201d said Guardiola when asked about Luis Enrique outside the polling station. \u201cFootball is a process. You don\u2019t just turn up and in November you\u2019re champions.\u201d     Real Sociedad striker Carlos Vela celebrates with team-mates after scoring against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Photograph: Juan Herrero/EPA    \u2022 Real Sociedad have won just twice all season \u2026 against Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Asier Santana was the man in charge for one night only as they beat Atl\u00e9tico 2-1 at Anoeta. Carlos Vela scored a beauty and Imanol Agirretxe added a great header to turn it around after Mario Mandzukic had scored the first. Real Sociedad\u2019s president Jokin Aperribay said that he hopes to announce the new coach on Monday and that the two candidates are David Moyes and Pepe Mel. Contrary to a number reports, some of which even declared it \u201cofficial\u201d, Moyes had still not given a definitive answer on Sunday night. Whoever it is, he better not think la Real are going to get anywhere in the cup this season. \u2022 That result was another good one for Real Madrid who, Barcelona\u2019s win aside, had almost the perfect weekend while pretty much everyone else got kind of bored. Sevilla drew, Valencia drew, Villarreal drew because of a last minute goal from Diego Colotto, and Atl\u00e9tico lost. Even Celta drew. Nolito did get his Spain call-up, by the way. And it\u2019s M\u00e1laga who are now up to sixth with their fifth consecutive win, equalling a club record, thanks to an 89th minute penalty from Nordin Amrabat. \u2022 \u201cThat might not have been good enough against Madrid but it will be against most teams.\u201d So said the Rayo coach Paco. He was right too. This weekend\u2019s biggest losers were, in a strange sort of way, one of its biggest winners. \u2022 Madrid\u2019s best player was Kroos, who scored a glorious goal. With crushing inevitability, Marca\u2019s headline called him a \u201cPanzer.\u201d Results: C\u00f3rdoba 0-0 Deportivo, Almer\u00eda 1-2 Barcelona, Getafe 0-0 Elche, Real Madrid 5-1 Rayo, Celta 0-0 Granada, M\u00e1laga 2-1 Eibar, Sevilla 1-1 Levante, Espanyol 1-1 Villarreal, Valencia 0-0 Athletic, Real Sociedad 2-1 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid      Pos Team P GD Pts      1 Real Madrid 11 31 27    2 Barcelona 11 20 25    3 Valencia 11 14 24    4 Atletico Madrid 11 9 23    5 Sevilla 11 7 23    6 Malaga 11 5 21    7 Celta Vigo 11 6 20    8 Villarreal 11 2 15    9 Getafe 11 -6 14    10 Eibar 11 -2 13    11 Athletic Bilbao 11 -5 12    12 Espanyol 11 -2 11    13 Rayo Vallecano 11 -10 11    14 Granada 11 -11 10    15 Real Sociedad 11 -4 9    16 Almeria 11 -5 9    17 Deportivo La Coruna 11 -9 9    18 Elche 11 -12 9    19 Levante 11 -23 9    20 Cordoba 11 -10 6     ", "sentences": ["On the way back from Amsterdam after playing Ajax their plane broke down."], "title": "Where will Barcelona and Espanyol play if Catalonia gets independence? | Sid Lowe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/nov/10/barcelona-espanyol-catalonia-independence", "tags": ["La Liga", "Barcelona", "Espanyol", "European club football", "Football", "Sport", "Catalonia", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-11T14:59:40Z", "article": " It\u2019s been two months since term started at Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden, as part of my Erasmus year abroad. But I still haven\u2019t haven\u2019t received my Erasmus mobility grant \u2013 worth an average of 272 euros per month, the exact amount varying between countries depending on the cost of living. I haven\u2019t been told when it\u2019s coming either \u2013 the money was meant to reach us at the beginning of the academic year.  Even better, I\u2019ve been told that because of cuts by the European Commission, my grant is being reduced by around a third. I\u2019m lucky because I have the means to support myself financially \u2013 but I\u2019m not the only one going through this. One third of the 73 Erasmus students I\u2019ve asked were affected by or are still experiencing similar delays. In a country as expensive as Sweden, this is no laughing matter. Living independently in a foreign land \u2013 often for the first time \u2013 comes with multiple sources of stress: buying everything required for settling in, getting to grips with a new education system, and making a new group of friends, among others. Many students factor in the Erasmus grants to help them with these tasks. But this delay is throwing their plans awry and adding more frustration to this stressful period. Seven people have approached Ume\u00e5 University\u2019s housing office to postpone the payment of their rent, according to a university spokesperson. This year, the old Erasmus system is being replaced by a new scheme called Erasmus+. As such, the UCL spokesperson says there have been bureaucratic delays in processing the paperwork that the European Commission requires through the British Council. \u201cIn previous years, the funding process has been timely and clear, so we are confident that this is probably a one-off situation. \u201cUCL is committed to ensuring that all communication and requests made from the British Council are acted upon as a priority.\u201d They also say the university has been expressing to the British Council how critical it is for students to receive the funding. But the fact still remains \u2013 many students from British universities remain without their grants. Helen Chandler-Wilde, a UCL student doing her year abroad at the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan, may have to return home next week because she can\u2019t afford to stay overseas without the grant. \u201cI have 100 euros left after paying the rent, which is to last until the Erasmus funds come \u2018in the next few weeks\u2019. I won\u2019t have food money in a week and am even putting off buying toilet roll! \u201cI feel lucky that my parents have initially been able to help me out, but I can\u2019t imagine how bad it must be for students whose parents aren\u2019t as financially fortunate.\u201d Chandler-Wilde has started a petition through the university\u2019s Conservative society to \u201chold UCL to account\u201d. Amy Williams, a student at the University of Sussex, has just started her Erasmus year at the University of Amsterdam. She is worried about her rent and is unhappy to be slipping into her overdraft. \u201cStudying in England, you take things like the cost of travel and the price of books for granted, as there\u2019s always an option to get a part time job \u2013 which is not so easy when abroad. \u201cMore than anything, it\u2019s the sitting in limbo that is hardest to deal with,\u201d says Williams. A spokesperson from Sussex says: \u201cWe always encourage students to think of the Erasmus funding as a contribution towards the costs of studying abroad, rather than as an essential part of their budgeting.\u201d This is not just a British problem. I\u2019ve spoken to people from German, Italian, French, Spanish and Belgian universities who have all faced \u2013 and continue to face \u2013 delays. Patricia Charro, a student from Spain, is on an exchange at the University of Bologna. She still has no idea when her grant will come in. She says: \u201cThis is making it hard for me to strike a balance between just getting by and enjoying my time overseas.\u201d In France, the problem seems worse \u2013 some students at French universities have been told that demand for funding outstrips supply.  A French student studying in the University of Bologna, who didn\u2019t want to be named, says she and a friend were told only after they went overseas that there wouldn\u2019t be enough money \u2013 and so they wouldn\u2019t receive any funds. Why are we facing these difficulties when the \u20ac15 billion budget for Erasmus+ is reportedly an increase of 40% over the previous system? Communication has broken down somewhere and it\u2019s us \u2013 the students who are supposed to benefit from this programme \u2013 who are suffering. Response from the British Council: David Hibler, Erasmus programme manager for the British Council, says: \u201cWe regret any delays students are experiencing in receiving the funds. They should be aware that this is a complex programme in its first year, with different actors working together to ensure it is launched as envisaged. \u201cFactors specific to the UK have led to the need for institutions to spread the funding further than previous years. Demand has grown by 9% on last year \u2013 more than in recent years \u2013 but the budget has only grown by 1%. So there\u2019s real pressure now on the mobility budget. \u201cThe Erasmus grant is a maintenance grant \u2013 a contribution to the additional costs of mobility. Students should still be receiving their loan from the student loan company. \u201cSome universities \u2013 once they\u2019ve received the grant agreement, or even before \u2013 may have paid students in advance using money from another source. \u201cBut we are sorry and that regret applies to any of the delays from whatever origin, including those beyond our control.\u201d Updated response from UCL: A spokesperson says: \u201cWhilst UCL waits for the funding from the British Council, our student funding office is prioritising requests from Erasmus students where financial assistance is required. \u201cThis will ensure that UCL students are supported during their exchange.\u201d", "sentences": ["Amy Williams, a student at the University of Sussex, has just started her Erasmus year at the University of Amsterdam."], "title": "Erasmus grant delays blight students' years abroad", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/11/erasmus-grant-delays-blight-students-years-abroad", "tags": ["Students", "Advice for students", "Studying abroad", "Higher education", "International students", "Education"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-11T16:51:49Z", "article": "They are a glowing union of life and light surrounded by darkness, two orbiting stars whose luminous love may be the only warmth in an otherwise empty barren universe.

In the National Gallery, Rembrandt\u2019s masterpiece of love and inwardness is called Couple Posing as Isaac and Rebecca, and can currently be seen in the great exhibition Rembrandt: The Late Works \u2013 but its popular title is The Jewish Bride. That traditional name seems fitting to me, for it conveys the philosemitism of one of Europe\u2019s greatest painters. This term philosemitism has been caustically debated recently. Julie Burchill\u2019s new book in which she protests her admiration not just for Jewish people but her peculiar macho vision of Jewishness is giving it a bad name. But as a non-Jewish admirer of Jewish culture myself, I find this critique of philosemitism a bit troubling. What do you prefer \u2013 antisemitism? Hatred of Jews remains the most persistent and lethal form of racism in history. No other ethnic identity has faced such a sustained and efficient attempt to eradicate it by a powerful modern industrial state, that left more than 5 million people dead and entire cultural worlds extinguished.      Michelangelo\u2019s statue of Moses, in the tomb of Julius II. Photo: Gianni Dagli Orti    The Holocaust was the outcome of a vicious antisemitism going back deep into Europe\u2019s history. The First Crusade started with a slaughter of Jews in the Rhineland in 1096 even before the bloodthirsty knights got to Jerusalem and massacred its inhabitants of all faiths. Nor can Britain complacently imagine we were different. In 1290 the Jewish population of this country was expelled. It took Oliver Cromwell to end the exclusion. Rabid antisemitism scars Christopher Marlowe\u2019s play The Jew of Malta and cannot be written out of Shakespeare\u2019s The Merchant of Venice. This hatred is not safely confined to the past. Ukip, on the edge of becoming a mainstream British political party, is allied in the European parliament with a Polish far-right Hitler fan. Meanwhile antisemitic attacks increased this year. The counter-tradition of philosemitism, which long predates Julie Burchill, surely should be praised rather than condemned. One writer whose philosemitism often goes unnoticed is Giorgio Vasari, whose 16th-century book The Lives of the Artists tells how Rome\u2019s Jewish population adopted Michelangelo\u2019s statue of Moses as an icon. Vasari says Roman Jews would go and see it regularly. Centuries later Sigmund Freud would describe his own visit to the Moses as a kind of pilgrimage. Michelangelo\u2019s Moses belongs to a category of European art that so deeply identifies with the Old Testament it can be seen as \u201cJewish\u201d. For Michelangelo, the man who led the Israelites out of Egypt is one of the great heroes of history: that was how Renaissance thinkers saw Moses, as a great secular leader. Machiavelli praises him in The Prince.     Belshazzar\u2019s Feast by Rembrandt, after 1635.

Art historians quibble about the true extent of his involvement in Jewish Amsterdam \u2013 the chilly academic renaming of The Jewish Bride is part of that scepticism. But the fact is that Rembrandt imagines himself under the skin of the Old Testament in a way that is self-evidently warm and admiring towards Jewish history and culture.

Determined to block the construction of a new 12km energy pipeline, which they said threatened three parks and hundreds of trees, the protesters built treehouses and small forts, occupying the park for three months in the dead of winter. Today, G\u00e4hlerpark is a quiet patch of green surrounded by blocks of flats. But during the occupation it was a hub of activity: banners were strung from branches reading: \u201cThis park belongs to us all!\u201d and \u201cSave the trees!\u201d \u2013 and a steady stream of visitors came trundling down the park\u2019s slippery paths and through the snow, bringing food and supplies to the occupiers. \u201cIt was wonderful!\u201d exclaims Astrid Matthiae, a long-term local resident and activist in the Moorburgtrasse Stoppen! campaign against the pipeline, as she retraces her steps through the park, pointing out trees that were once scheduled to be cut down, and shivering theatrically at memories of that winter\u2019s cold, damp and freezing winds.  The G\u00e4hlerpark occupation was about much more than protecting local green space, however: the pipeline at the centre of the dispute would have connected Hamburg to an already controversial coal-fired power plant, under construction by Swedish energy giant Vattenfall across the river Elbe. Activists said the entire project was unacceptable because of climate change, and had to be stopped.  The protesters came down from the trees in March 2010, after a court ruled to temporarily suspend the pipeline approval. But a spark had been lit: anger continued to grow over the prospect of a new coal plant in one of Europe\u2019s \u201cgreenest cities\u201d and demands for greater local control over Hamburg\u2019s energy system became increasingly mainstream.  Three years later, a mass campaign by dozens of environmental, consumer and religious groups culminated in a September 2013 referendum. And with a narrow majority, Germany\u2019s second-largest city voted to take all available steps to completely take over the electricity, gas, and district heating networks that it had sold to Vattenfall and German energy company E.On only decades earlier.  In the process, Hamburg joined a growing number of cities worldwide deciding to end their experiments with privatisation. Since 2007, 170 municipalities in Germany alone have brought energy services back into public hands. Globally, at least 100 cities have done the same with privatised water services over the past 15 years, including dozens of municipalities in France \u2013 once seen as a growing focus for water privatisation.  Some describe this little-known trend \u2013 called \u201cremunicipalisation\u201d in academic jargon \u2013 as a worldwide, local-level backlash against the period of neoliberalism under which basic services have for the past 30 years been subject to mass privatisation. Hamburg is the largest city in Germany to decide to buy back its privatised energy services; a similar referendum to remunicipalise energy in Berlin failed, though the city did vote to buy back its water services in 2011. Germany\u2019s northern industrial capital might have seemed an unlikely setting for such a move: Hamburg has been a hub for global trade and commerce for hundreds of years, and its port is still among the world\u2019s largest, handling much of Europe\u2019s imports and exports. But last year Hamburgers decided that not everything should be left to the market \u2013 by voting to buy back the city\u2019s energy grids, they chose to end one of their largest experiments in privatisation.  \u201cIn Germany, every month there is a new town that is buying back its energy infrastructure. This is very common right now,\u201d said Christian Maas, former state secretary for the environment and urban planning in Hamburg. \u201cPeople are interested in local energy supply and that is contradictory to the centralised, high profit-orientated large utility.\u201d     The coal-fired power plant, under construction across the river Elbe in Hamburg. Photograph: Claire Provost    Satoko Kishimoto, co-ordinator of the water justice project at the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam, pointed to recent cases in the water sector in Africa and Asia, from Mozambique to Malaysia: \u201cThis is not a minor trend: many municipalities have been disappointed with privatisation, with costs, with service quality,\u201d she said. \u201cRemunicipalisation is seen as a tangible response, a way to rebuild important social services, more democratically.\u201d \u201cA lot of it has been happening off the radar screen,\u201d said David McDonald, professor at Queen\u2019s University in Canada and co-director of the Municipal Services Project international research network. \u201cWe have had this massive trend since the 1970s towards privatisation - an ideologically driven, powerful trend - which has created enormous debates. But now we are starting to see something happen, including outright reversals.\u201d In Hamburg, activists launched the Unser Hamburg, Unser Netz (Our Hamburg, Our Networks) campaign in 2010 after noticing that the city\u2019s existing contracts with Vattenfall and E.On were set to expire. The campaign brought out a wide range of supporters: environmental groups said buying back the grids would give Hamburg more control over its energy systems, and make it possible to really drive the city\u2019s Energiewende transition away from coal and nuclear power and towards renewable energy. Consumer organisations, meanwhile, argued that Vattenfall and E.On were at the same time the owners of the energy networks, and primary producers and buyers of energy - a bad situation for competition and for consumers. Religious and anti-poverty groups added that energy networks should not be the object of private property, but run as public resources instead. Remunicipalisation rallies brought middle-aged men in crisp suits out alongside students and dreadlocked musicians. There is little international research on remunicipalisation and no exact figure of how many have already happened, or how many are under way. But a list of 180 known cases in the water sector, compiled by the Public Services International Research Unit (PSIRU) at the University of Greenwich and the Transnational Institute, includes cities in every region: from Bordeaux, France and Bielefeld, Germany to Budapest (Hungary), Buenos Aires (Argentina), and Badung Bali (Indonesia). McDonald sketches out a range of motives: \u201cIn the US, a movement for in-sourcing has often come from very conservative governments who see they can save money by bringing things back in-house. Sometimes cities have no choice \u2013 nobody is actually bidding for the contracts. Sometimes private contractors leave. And other times there are political movements, grassroots protests to get private companies out for different reasons.\u201d There are still some cities, however, where little mention is ever made of remunicipalisation as a serious policy option.  In the UK, a serious movement to remunicipalise like other major European cities has yet to emerge. \u201cThere are some isolated critical voices, but the main three political parties are basically OK with the status quo, linked up with the Washington consensus \u2013 that the private sector is efficient and this is not questionable,\u201d said Emanuele Lobina, principal lecturer with the PSIRU. Lobina says bringing water services in England back into public hands could yield savings in the range of \u00a3900m a year and that these resources could help tackle rising water poverty. He blamed what he calls a \u201cWestminster consensus\u201d for ignoring \u201call empirical evidence of the possible savings that could be achieved through remunicipalisation, and the problems of water privatisation in England and Wales\u201d.     Wind turbines line the motorways nearby Hamburg, underlining the city\u2019s commitment to renewables. Photograph: Claire Provost    Cities can face a range of obstacles, said McDonald, in trying to regain control of once-public services: \u201cGetting everyone on board can be very challenging. You can have very strong internal resistance. There can also be high legal costs, and companies suing for loss of contracts \u2026 [And] if you\u2019ve had a private company delivering services for 10 or 20 years, you may no longer have trucks, or an IT system.\u201d \u201cIt can be a very David and Goliath battle, if you\u2019re thinking of ending a contract with a big company,\u201d he warned.  In Hamburg, the referendum to remunicipalise passed, but narrowly - with just 50.9% of the vote. \u201cIt was a really tough political fight. It was very, very long-running and in the end it was a very, very close referendum,\u201d said Jens Kerstan, head of the Green party in Hamburg.  A similar referendum in Berlin, also over the remunicipalisation of energy services, failed narrowly just two months after Hamburg\u2019s vote. The motorways running in and out of Hamburg are lined with giant windmills, slowly churning the air, constant reminders of the country\u2019s ambitious green goals. Shifting the city\u2019s energy transition into higher gear was one of the key promises of remunicipalisation.  The referendum ballot proposed not only to take back the city\u2019s energy grids, but to institute as a binding target \u201ca socially just, democratically controlled and climate-friendly energy supply from renewable sources\u201d. Maas said the big private companies in town hadn\u2019t wanted to touch small, decentralised energy projects. Remunicipalisation, on the other hand, offers the chance to \u201cgive something to the city, change the energy system, provide stable energy prices for the people, make the city less dependent on foreign imports and fossil fuels\u201d. Ahead of the referendum, Hamburg had already bought back a 25.1% interest in the energy grids, but campaigners said this was not enough: only a complete take-over would give the city the power to do things differently.  Nothing is happening overnight, however, as the city is waiting for its existing contracts with the energy companies to expire - a process that will take several years.  In February 2014, Hamburg closed a deal to pay Vattenfall \u20ac550m to buy the city\u2019s electricity grid from the company. Karen Kristina Hillmer, Vattenfall\u2019s spokesperson in Hamburg, said the price was determined by jointly appointed external experts, and based on common valuation standards. \u201cThe agreement is a fair deal for both Vattenfall and for the city of Hamburg and its citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough Vattenfall has not disconnected from the electricity grid easily, this agreement avoids disputes and provides a good basis for a long-term future for Vattenfall in the region of Hamburg and a continued good co-operation with Hamburg.\u201d The contract for Hamburg\u2019s gas network is up next in 2015. But it will probably be 2019 before the much more valuable district heating grid is back in public hands. In this case, G\u00fcnther H\u00f6rmann, at the Consumer Centre of Hamburg, warned that there was real concern that the city might be overpaying to take it back. Reports suggest the pricetag could exceed \u20ac1bn. \u2022 Claire Provost and Matt Kennard are fellows at the Centre for Investigative Journalism in London.", "sentences": ["Photograph: Claire Provost    Satoko Kishimoto, co-ordinator of the water justice project at the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam, pointed to recent cases in the water sector in Africa and Asia, from Mozambique to Malaysia: \u201cThis is not a minor trend: many municipalities have been disappointed with privatisation, with costs, with service quality,\u201d she said."], "title": "Hamburg at forefront of global drive to reverse privatisation of city services", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/12/hamburg-global-reverse-privatisation-city-services", "tags": ["Cities", "Germany", "Utilities", "Privatisation", "Europe", "Politics", "Environment", "Green economy", "Local politics", "Local government"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-12T15:01:36Z", "article": "Watching letters float and twist across a page, flipping and jumbling with gymnastic abandon, can be a daily frustration for readers with dyslexia. But the restless characters might soon be tamed thanks to a new font. Developed by young Dutch designer Christian Boer, the Dyslexie typeface, currently on show at the Istanbul Design Biennial, has put all 26 letters of the alphabet through a finely-tuned process of adjustment to weigh them down and make it harder for similar letters to be confused. \u201cWhen they\u2019re reading, people with dyslexia often unconsciously switch, rotate and mirror letters in their minds,\u201d says Boer, who is dyslexic himself. \u201cTraditional typefaces make this worse, because they base some letter designs on others, inadvertently creating \u2018twin letters\u2019 for people with dyslexia.\u201d To counteract this tendency, Boer has introduced a number of tweaks. First, the letters are weighted towards the bottom, as if the bulk of each character\u2019s body has slumped downwards under accelerated gravitational pressure. This sets a heavy baseline, which makes it harder for the letters to be flipped upside down \u2013 and gives the font the look of a chubby-ankled cousin of Comic Sans.     Similar characters are slanted and deformed to make it harder for them to be confused. Image: Christian Boer Photograph: Christian Boer    This lowered centre of gravity is joined by specific alterations to differentiate similar letters. In many fonts, the d is the same as a b is the same as a p is the same as a q \u2013 a simple hoop on a stick, variously mirrored and rotated to form four different characters. Boer\u2019s typeface distorts each letter, slanting the extenders and descenders and enlarging the openings to make them harder to confuse, in a process of careful anatomical refinement. Other similar looking letters are given different heights and their proportions slightly deformed. The valleys of the v, w and y are all set at subtly different levels, while the c is prised open more than usual to make it less similar to an o. Elsewhere, tails are lengthened and the space between letters is increased to counteract the common crowding effect, while capital letters and punctuation are bolded, making it easier to spot where one sentence ends and a new one begins. Boer first developed the typeface for his final thesis project at the Utrecht Academy of Art back in 2008, and it has since been put through its paces by researchers at the University of Amsterdam and the University of Twente. Their studies found that 84% of readers could read text in the Dyslexie font faster than a standard typeface, while 77% reported fewer mistakes. The font was presented at a TED talk in 2011, and other similar typefaces have sprung up since \u2013 from OpenDyslexic to Spellex DysLex.", "sentences": ["Boer first developed the typeface for his final thesis project at the Utrecht Academy of Art back in 2008, and it has since been put through its paces by researchers at the University of Amsterdam and the University of Twente."], "title": "Dyslexie: the chubby-ankled font that makes reading easier for dyslexics", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/nov/12/dyslexie-new-font-that-makes-reading-easier-with-dyslexia", "tags": ["Design", "Art and design", "Dyslexia", "Culture", "Health", "Society", "Education"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-13T08:36:55Z", "article": "Yesterday was a moment of celebration for European science. Although the precise fate of the Philae probe remains unclear, the remarkable achievements of the Rosetta mission reflect the noblest ideals of pan-European research: 2000 scientists and engineers from across the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA) pooling their resources and expertise in pursuit of new knowledge. Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA\u2019s director-general, described it as \u201ca great great day, not only for ESA, but...I think for the world.\u201d But while the eyes of Europe\u2019s scientific community were fixed firmly upwards, back on earth, in the corridors of Brussels, a less edifying plan began to unfold. Borrowing a trick from the Jo Moore school of media management, the European Commission chose the evening before the Rosetta landing to confirm quietly that its most senior scientific role, that of chief scientific adviser (CSA) to its president, is being scrapped. Professor Anne Glover, who has occupied the CSA role since 2012, broke the news in an email last night to Sir Paul Nurse, president of the Royal Society, and his counterparts in national academies across Europe. The email says simply:  The European Commission confirmed to me yesterday that all decisions on the Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPA) were repealed and so the function of Chief Scientific Adviser has ceased to exist. The new European Political Strategy Centre (EPSC) which \u201creplaces\u201d BEPA does not comprise a function \u201cChief Scientific Adviser\u201d. It is not up to me to comment on this decision, but I would like to express that I am proud of what this office has achieved in less than 3 years with very few resources. This has only been possible thanks to your continued support throughout this time and the hard work of the fantastic members of my team who will now seek new opportunities. I am going to leave the Commission at the end of January and look forward to meet you again in the future. With all best wishes Anne  This decision comes after months of uncertainty surrounding the future of the CSA role, which was created in 2012, in response to calls to strengthen scientific advice and evidence-based policy in Europe.  In recent months, a war of letters has raged between critics and supporters of the role. In July 2014, a coalition of environmental groups, including Greenpeace, wrote to the incoming president of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, calling for the CSA role to be scrapped. Their letter argued that: \u201cThe post of CSA is fundamentally problematic as it concentrates too much influence in one person\u2026\u201d. Soon afterwards, a response letter in support of the CSA role was sent to Juncker, signed by forty scientific organisations and 773 individuals, which said \u201cwe cannot stress strongly enough our objection to any attempt to undermine the integrity and independence of scientific advice received at the highest level of the European Commission.\u201d (Full disclosure: I was a signatory to this second letter, in my capacity as chair of the Campaign for Social Science). Further letters of support for Glover were sent to Juncker by several scientific, business and civil society organisations, while Greenpeace also elaborated its position in a piece by Doug Parr on this blog. It initially appeared that President Juncker would renew the post of CSA. Quizzed on the topic in July by British MEP Julie Girling, he indicated as much. And in his mission letter to Carlos Moedas, the incoming Commissioner for Science, Research and Innovation, Juncker emphasized as one of his priorities the need to \u201cmake sure that Commission proposals and activities are based on sound scientific evidence\u201d.  But when the Barroso Commission left office at the end of October, Anne Glover\u2019s formal mandate ended, and her role was placed in limbo. Glover will now continue in an informal capacity and remain a member of Commission staff until the end of January. But she is no longer able to speak publicly as CSA, and may not even be able to attend the second meeting of the European science advisers\u2019 forum, which she created, when it meets in Amsterdam in early December.  Speaking this week to Science magazine, Mina Andreeva, a Commission spokesperson, said that \u201cPresident Juncker believes in independent scientific advice\u201d, but has not yet decided how to \u201cinstitutionalize\u201d the function. Previously, the CSA was based within the Bureau of European Policy Advisers, which has now been scrapped. Its successor body, the European Political Strategy Centre (EPSC), will not include a scientific adviser, as Glover\u2019s email last night confirmed.  Beneath headline disagreements over the renewal of the CSA role, there are legitimate debates to be had about the most effective arrangements for scientific advice in the Commission. Together with Rob Doubleday at the Cambridge Centre for Science and Policy, I am currently finalising a book of essays on Future Directions for Scientific Advice in Europe, to be published in early February 2015, which will include detailed recommendations and contributions by leading scientists, social scientists and policymakers from across Europe.  Anne Glover herself was very open about the challenges she faced in the role, the need for more resources, and the potential for closer integration with other functions, such as the Joint Research Centre, which describes itself as the Commission\u2019s \u201cin-house science service\u201d. I would urge those who have criticised her for a lack of transparency to watch this remarkably frank speech she gave at the Auckland summit on \u2018Science Advice to Governments\u2019 at the end of August.  As my colleague Roger Pielke Jr. has argued, CSAs are not superheroes: they can\u2019t singlehandedly cut through the messiness that so often erupts when science, politics and policy collide. But with proper support, sufficient resources, and appropriate protocols for independence and accountability, CSAs can make a positive difference, as we see in a growing number of advisory systems around the world. More than anything else, CSAs act as a magnifying device, able to draw on a wider and more distributed ecosystem of expertise, and focus its contribution in a way that is timely and relevant to the policy process.  It is hard not to interpret this week\u2019s decision as a serious downgrading of the status of scientific advice at the top of the Commission. I fully expect Europe\u2019s research community - and all those who want a stronger role for evidence in EU policy - to be up in arms over this outcome. Juncker now needs to clarify with urgency what precise structures for scientific advice he plans to put in place. Of course, Juncker is a busy man in a new job, but this issue seems to be disturbingly low on his to-do list. I am reliably informed that, despite repeated overtures from Anne Glover, Juncker has refused to meet with her to discuss the future of EU scientific advice. This attitude needs to change, and fast, if the new Commission is to maintain the confidence of the scientific community.  If the European CSA is now dead, snuffed out by bureaucratic indifference before its third birthday, the wider agenda of improving the evidence base for European policy must yet prevail.  And the scientific community owes a huge debt of gratitude to Anne Glover for all that she\u2019s done, against the odds, to advance this cause since 2012. Yesterday, in a poignant tweet about Rosetta, sent only minutes before she revealed to colleagues that her role was being axed, Glover observed that \u201cToday is such a special day and typifies the Europe I love \u2013 big ideas, big minds, big hearts, big ambition, big future\u2026\u201d. Quite what place scientific advice will occupy in that future remains to be seen.

The plying punks crept into holes, Who walk\u2019d the streets before by sholes.\u201d    The night had once been a time of transgression, where \u201cplying punks\u201d (prostitutes) could walk the streets freely \u201cby sholes\u201d (as in a school of fish), but street lighting had changed all that. These dark hours of rebellion were now claimed for the world of public appearances. Street lighting sought to impose discipline on the unruly city streets, opening it up as a safe time for the upper classes to socialise and conduct business, pushing out the punks.   From these first gas lanterns to today\u2019s big data-driven smart LED systems, street lighting has always been a powerful tool of social control: it shapes what is, and what isn\u2019t, permitted in the city after dark.      A watchman carrying a cresset, filled with burning oil or pitch, circa 1550. Illustration: Hulton Archive/Getty    The earliest recorded forms of public street lighting existed in Italy in the 16th century. Ropes soaked in pitch oil were ignited in iron baskets known as cressets, usually outside palaces. The breakthrough that led to our modern street lights was made in the 1660s in Amsterdam by the painter and inventor Jan van der Heyden (1637-1712), who designed a lantern that drew air through it to keep soot from accumulating on the glass. His design was much imitated, so that after centuries of darkness, the installation of oil lanterns in European cities happened very rapidly. As Craig Koslofsky outlines in his terrific history of the night, Evening\u2019s Empire: \u201cIn 1660, no European city had permanently illuminated its streets, but by 1700 consistent and reliable street lighting had been established in Amsterdam, Paris, Turin, London, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Vienna.\u201d  The use of street lighting as a form of control can be seen most clearly in Lille, one of the first cities to have lighting installed, only months after Paris and Amsterdam. Here, public lighting was imposed by the French military, who had recently captured the city. Lighting was deployed to pacify the unruly locals and provide greater security at night. It was only decades later that city correspondence referred to the lighting as a \u201cpublic convenience\u201d. But just as the invention of the ship was also the invention of the shipwreck, this attempt to reduce criminal activity through street lighting inadvertently created a new crime: smashing lanterns. Penalties were severe. In Leipzig, lantern-smashers were deterred by the threat of cutting off one\u2019s right hand.   While the activities of the traditional owners of the night \u2013 the young and the restless \u2013 may have been marginalised by street lighting, many others stood to benefit from it. In Koslofsky\u2019s book, an etching of Leipzig from 1702 illustrates the social effects. A man points to something in the distance, in arm with his well-dressed female partner; two men doff their hats, where before they wouldn\u2019t have recognised each other; another man reads a book under the glow of the public lantern. As light extends into the night, so do the day\u2019s activities. All of this appears positive and useful \u2013 but for whom? This depiction of a well-heeled class engaged in genteel activities suggests it was the bourgeoisie who benefitted, as street lighting made it safe enough for them to brave the evenings.     Smart street lights allow a city-wide insight into what is taking place within your lighting system, and allows you to communicate with it. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images     The longer day was not universally welcomed. The editor of Tatler wrote in 1710 that the lighting of London had \u201cthrown business and pleasure into the hours of rest, and by that means made the natural night by half as long as it should be\u201d. Our complaints today of the \u201calways on\u201d lifestyle dictated by the mobile phone find an interesting precedent here. Just as the phone allows you to be reached at any hour, street lighting destroyed the anonymity of the night, when people bearing lanterns could move about unrecognised. One now had to be dressed up for the street, further eroding the boundary between work and rest.   Despite these reservations, the genie was out of the bottle, and the lighting of cities worldwide was inexorable. The journal of a German visitor from 1782, now held in the British Library, describes London\u2019s street lights as being \u201cso near to each other, that even on the most ordinary and common nights, the city has the appearance of a festive illusion\u201d. Piped gas was rolled out in 1807; by the 1820s London had more than 40,000 gas lights, lining 215 miles of streets. Electric lighting was introduced in London in the 1880s, and gradually expanded its reach across the country.      An etching from 1702 of the street lighting and night-life in Leipzig. Photograph: BBC     Today, up to 40% of a city\u2019s electricity use is dedicated to street lighting, keeping those yellow sodium vapour lights humming through the night. As local councils\u2019 budgets are reduced, they\u2019re eagerly looking to find savings and reduce costs. Los Angeles has recently completed the world\u2019s largest lighting retrofit, replacing 141,000 street lights with LEDs fixtures, with many other US cities following suit. Another strategy is to simply switch them off. Apparently one in three UK councils are experimenting with dimming or blacking out street lights at times of low usage, not without consequences for safety. Switch out the lights, and the dangers of the night creep back in.  The next big thing in lighting, as with seemingly everything today, is \u201csmart\u201d. The Philips company\u2019s IntelligentCity system offers a \u201ccomplete insight into what is taking place within your lighting system, [and] allows you to communicate with it\u201d. This is the world of the city dashboard, a central control system of glowing monitors and data feeds, promising mayors and city officials a god\u2019s-eye view of their city, and the ability to control it at the swipe of a touchscreen. This promise isn\u2019t new, it has its roots in the cybernetic thinking of the 1960s, a fascinating history Evgeny Morozov explores over at the New Yorker. But with today\u2019s technology, the dream of the smart city dashboard finally appears realisable.   These systems are promoted as environmentally friendly and cost effective. Philips claims that switching to LED street lights and installing intelligent systems can save cities 70% on energy. But just as with the earliest gas lamps, the IntelligentCity system is also pitched as a way to maintain social control, \u201cprevent[ing] crime by keeping lights on in problematic neighbourhoods\u201d. The latest product in Philips\u2019 arsenal is the LumiMotion lamp-post, a street light and motion sensor in one, which lights up as people walk under it. And new navigational headsets for blind people use sensors in lamp-posts to help you \u201chear\u201d your surroundings as a \u201c3D soundscape\u201d.     A sensor in Chicago\u2019s Array of Things project, which seeks to better understand the natural and built environment and its impact on liveability with respect to climate, air quality, noise, and other factors \u2013 effectively creating a \u2018fitness tracker\u2019 for Chicago.  Photograph: Urban Centre for Computation and Data    Do these generally useful new technologies also point toward a more sinister future for public lighting? In the pursuit of adapting to the public\u2019s needs, these pieces of urban infrastructure are harvesting more and more private data, further eroding our privacy. Similarly to the smart bins that caused outrage in London last year for tracking smartphones, smart lamp-posts proposed for Chicago will scoop up the mobile phone traffic of passers-by. At stake is the question of who owns this data and what\u2019s done with it. When public infrastructure such as lamp-posts become tools for private companies to snoop on public citizens, a line is crossed.   The future of street lighting may not be lamp-posts at all. Three hundred and fifty years after Jan van der Heyden, another Dutch designer, Daan Roosegaarde, is developing a new approach to public lighting that does away with lights on poles altogether. His work draws upon ideas of biomimicry, asking what can we learn from nature to apply to the built environment. The Smart Highway near Oss in the Netherlands uses glow-in-the-dark paint as the road markings; they\u2019ve also trialed glow-in-the-dark stones as a bicycle path.      Daan Roosegaarde\u2019s cycling path in Noord-Brabant is inspired by Van Gogh. It absorbs light during the day and emits a glowing route at night. Photograph: Studio Roosegaarde    But Roosegaarde\u2019s big trick is bioluminescence. Working with the State University of New York, he has developed a prototype plant containing luciferin, the compound that produces light in a firefly or jellyfish. His team is now working on bioluminescent street trees, which would effectively replace existing street lights. \u201cIt\u2019s energy neutral, but also very poetic,\u201d says Roosegarde. \u201cI think in the end the technology will completely disappear.\u201d  In this future, where trees glow into the evening, nature is adapted to conform to our nocturnal lifestyles, providing a soft green glow. Perhaps this beautiful sight could even tempt the plying punks out of their holes.

Since 1994 when the first Eurostar services launched between Waterloo International, Paris Gare du Nord, Brussels Midi and Lille Europe, 150m passengers have taken a trip on the high-speed passenger trains.  To mark its 20th anniversary, Eurostar have unveiled its new e320 train but passengers will have to wait till the end of 2015 when the new trains are scheduled to enter commercial service.

Former Guardian transport correspondent Rebecca Smithers visits an empty Waterloo International station to remember the first Eurostar and lament the end of a station.    In the 20 years that the Eurostar has been running, a range of routes have been introduced: from the introduction of a service between London to Disneyland Paris in 1996 to the start of a direct summer route from Waterloo and Ashford to Avignon in the south of France.  The graphic below shows the Eurostar timeline, detailing the introduction of new stations and routes. It also includes upcoming routes such as the services to Geneva via Lille (to be introduced on 14 December 2014) and the anticipated London to Amsterdam service to be launched at the end of 2016.       According to the Eurostar press office, London to Paris is the most popular route. It takes 2hrs 15 mins on the London to Paris service - an hour less than when it first started - and despite the same trip taking 1hr 15 mins via plane, Eurostar state that the train service is quicker than flying.  It estimates that the London to Paris journey on its trains takes 2hrs 47mins (including check in, security, customs and journey time) while the plane service would end up taking 3h 55mins of a passenger\u2019s day (this includes averages for transfers, check-in, security, customs, baggage reclaim and journey time).

Yet if you had seen him, it is also fair to say you might never have forgotten what it was like when he had a ball at his feet. Doherty is the player nobody mentions when they talk of that group at Manchester United who eventually became known as the class of 92. He was on the opposite wing to Ryan Giggs and for a while Alex Ferguson and his coaching staff wondered whether he was actually the better player. \u201cOne of the fastest wingers many people have ever seen,\u201d according to Tony Park, co-author of Sons of United, a history of the club\u2019s youth team. \u201cThe United scouts said he \u2018could catch pigeons\u2019 he was that quick.\u201d Park has been watching United at that level since the late-1970s and reckons in all that time he has seen only four absolute certainties to make it to the top: Norman Whiteside, Paul Scholes, Giggs (then Wilson) and Doherty. \u201cOne coach commented that of all the lads at the club at the time only Wilson, Scholes and Doherty were certs to make the grade. And while Wilson had a great left foot with pace, and Scholes could use both feet brilliantly but lacked pace, Doherty had it all.\u201d Brendan Rodgers can vouch for it, too. He and Doherty were friends from the same boys\u2019 team in Northern Ireland and early in the Ferguson years at Old Trafford they used to travel together to represent United at schoolboy level. Rodgers could not be clearer. \u201cSpeak to Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, the Nevilles, they will all tell you he was the best player they ever played with at that level.\u201d Ferguson put Doherty in his squad for the first time when he was 16, in March 1990. \u201cBehind the scenes Doherty is tipped to make the kind of impact not seen since George Best was given his chance,\u201d David Meek wrote for the Manchester Evening News. \u201cAlex Ferguson is being urged by his back-room staff to play the boy from Belfast.\u201d He was a few miles out \u2013 Doherty was actually from Strabane in County Tyrone \u2013 but you get the point. \u201cHis speed and skill have been a revelation in training,\u201d Meek continued. \u201cDoherty, a first-year trainee, is immensely shy but plays with a courage to match his ability. He is a winger who can dribble at top speed and shoot with either foot.\u201d Except Doherty never played for Manchester United and his story, ultimately, is laced in tragedy. A few days before he was supposed to make his debut his knee gave way in an A-team fixture against Carlisle: his cruciate ligaments, the injury every footballer fears the most. It took seven months to heal and in his comeback game the joint buckled again. This time he was out for more than a year. He returned again but after a handful of games it was clear he was not the same player. The cruciate was even more of a big deal back then than it is now. It destroyed, rather than delayed, careers. Adrian was one of the victims. His father, Jimmy, has always thought United should have done more to care for his son during and after that long rehabilitation. The truth is the \u201cDoc\u201d, as the other players called him, was not the classic superstar-in-the-making. He was different: bohemian, slightly eccentric in a football context. He was not particularly interested in haircuts or cars or looking the part, often turning up at the Cliff, United\u2019s old training ground, in a baggy old Aran sweater with a guitar over his shoulder. Robbie Savage, from the year below, remembers him \u201cstrumming in the next room\u201d. Doherty took that guitar to the Christmas do where he played a song, possibly a Bob Dylan track, to his team-mates. He did not really follow football, preferring to write poems. \u201cHe was a fearless, strong and skilful footballer but what I remember most was his personality and his intelligence,\u201d Brian McClair says. \u201cHe loved to chat about music, books and poetry.\u201d His former team-mates remember him\u00a0becoming something of a lost soul. He drifted, even working for a spell in a chocolates factory in Preston. There were three appearances for Derry City, where Jimmy was once on the books. Then he gave up football for good. Rodgers remembers his friend wanting to break into the music industry and there is some grainy old footage on the internet of his band playing Strabane\u2019s Melmount Centre and one of his favourite Dylan songs, All Along The Watchtower.     Adrian Doherty\u2019s potential, so highly rated at Manchester United and other clubs, was crushed by a knee injury.  Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Empics    It never worked out. April 2000 was the time United, now European champions, won their sixth championship in eight seasons and the superstars from the class of 92 paraded another trophy inside Old Trafford. It was also the month Doherty decided to move to Amsterdam to work for a furniture company. In his first week he slipped into the canal, on the way to catch an early-morning train. He was in a coma for a month, and died on 9 June. The next day would have been his 27th birthday. Why tell this story now? It happens to be the anniversary on Wednesday of the day he signed for United, aged 14, with the rest of his life ahead of him. And it is a story that deserves to be told: the star we never saw. Better than Giggs? We will never know whether he had the personality for all that brilliant potential to flower but he had everything else. Arsenal had tried to sign Doherty before United gazumped them (Pat Rice described him as \u201ca blur\u201d). So had Brian Clough for Nottingham Forest. Matt Bradley, who helped alert United after coaching Doherty at Moorfield Boys in Derry, regards him as \u201cthe best young player I have seen in Ireland in over 30 years of coaching and scouting\u201d. Billy Bingham called Doherty into Ireland\u2019s under-21s when he was 17 (Ferguson withdrew him on the basis he thought he was too young). Gary Neville remembers \u201can easy-going lad who got on with everybody, who never upset anyone, just a really good lad\u201d. The club ran a tribute in Inside United magazine in 2007 and Giggs, five months younger than Doherty, described him as \u201cformidable\u201d. Park has seen them all. \u201cImagine a bit of Giggs, a bit of Andrei Kanchelskis and a bit of Cristiano Ronaldo, then put it all together; Doherty had everything.\u201d The Doherty story is certainly a reminder about how cruel this business can be and how quickly, with a bad landing, a late tackle or just the wrong turn of a knee, everything can change. Doherty is far from alone in that. The football world is littered with people the sport has left behind, quickly forgotten because injuries ended their careers before they had even really started. Plenty find their lives spiralling and, however bewildering Gordon Taylor might be, at least there are some good people working for the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association who recognise more needs to be done\u00a0these days for the footballers the game passes up. Jimmy and Geraldine, their daughter, Ciara, and sons Gareth and Peter gathered for the funeral on 16 June 2000. \u201cTributes Flow for Tragic Soccer \u2018Gem\u2019\u201d was the headline in the Derry Journal. There was nothing about it, however, in the English press, bar a few lines in the Sunday Mirror. Football had moved on, like the juggernaut it is. It was the day before England played Germany in Euro 2000, with Beckham, Scholes and both Nevilles in the team. The newspapers had plenty to fill their pages. Yet the people who saw Doherty play will not forget the sense of awe when he had the ball. There is something of the fifth Beatle to Doherty\u2019s story considering what happened next to Giggs, Beckham et al and it is good to learn that one day it will be told in full. A book is planned and there are certainly some distinguished football people to make contributions. Ferguson will be one \u2013 the former United manager introduced Doherty in one set of programme notes as \u201cgreased lightning\u201d \u2013 and Rodgers will be another. Liverpool\u2019s manager tells one story about his time on Reading\u2019s playing staff when Jim Leighton joined on loan and Rodgers got talking to him about life at Old Trafford. \u201cI asked him if he had heard of such-and-such a youth player and he said no, and such-and-such a youth player and he said no.\u201d That was the moment Rodgers mentioned he had been friends with a young lad from Strabane called Adrian. Leighton stopped. \u201cThe Doc?\u201d he said. \u201cThe Doc is a legend.\u201d Dier\u2019s England decision simply does not add up However it is dressed up, Eric Dier\u2019s request to be excluded from the England Under-21s is strange, to say the least, and it is not entirely easy to see how it benefits him in the long term. Dier says it is not a snub and that he simply wants to use the international break to put in some specialist work as a full-back now it is clear he will not be used in his favoured position in central defence. \u201cI just felt that this two-week period gives me the opportunity to work on parts of my game that I have had problems with over the past two months.\u201d Gareth Southgate, manager of the Under-21s, has chosen his words carefully to make it sound as though he does not hold it against the Tottenham player, and the Football Association has gone into overdrive to try to control what has come out in the media. But Dier\u2019s explanation does not stack up. He was one of England\u2019s better players in both legs of their play-off against Croatia and, as Southgate acknowledged, he may now have jeopardised his place in the team for next summer\u2019s European Championship. Tottenham, meanwhile, have 25 players away on international duty, with another five out injured. How possibly can a few sessions on a deserted training pitch be of more use to Dier than two more caps and the chance to help cement his place for a major tournament? Keane and the black marker pen Frank Gillespie, the pub landlord who ended up in hospital after a row with Roy Keane, is so well acquainted with the Republic of Ireland set-up he was allowed to sit with Jack Charlton in the dugout and has his own book, with a picture on the front cover of him supping Guinness with the former manager. It was his bar in Boston where Keane was drinking when he infamously turned up late for the team bus during a 1992 tournament, leading to the captain, Mick McCarthy, questioning his professionalism (and Keane, in turn, questioning McCarthy\u2019s first touch). Gillespie, in other words, is a familiar face on the Irish football scene. At the risk of sounding slightly harsh then, he probably should have known from experience that asking for Keane\u2019s autograph when he is on other business is about as sensible as getting out of your car in a safari park. When Keane was a player the Irish squad used to make contingency plans when it came to signing shirts and footballs. Nobody, quite simply, would dare suggest it was Keane\u2019s turn with the black marker pen. And over time the kit man, Johnny Fallon, perfected a Keane signature. As Niall Quinn recalls: \u201cGetting the kit man to forge the signature of one of your team-mates is the price you pay for accommodating genius.\u201d", "sentences": ["It was also the month Doherty decided to move to Amsterdam to work for a furniture company."], "title": "Adrian Doherty: the lost star of Manchester United\u2019s class of 92 | Daniel Taylor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/nov/15/adrian-doherty-manchester-united-class-of-92", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Football", "Sir Alex Ferguson", "Brendan Rodgers", "Ryan Giggs", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-16T00:04:03Z", "article": "In an enormous glasshouse a few hours from London, there\u2019s a powerful, unmistakable smell in the air: it\u2019s the one that seems to cling to some surly teenagers and drifts around on the breeze at pop festivals. Here, 30,000 cannabis plants sway gently beneath giant fans and immensely bright lights. Only the remarkable uniformity of the plants \u2013 and the people walking round in lab coats \u2013 tells you the place isn\u2019t some drug lord\u2019s illicit cannabis factory. This is the only research facility in the UK licensed to grow cannabis on a vast commercial scale. Here, Dr David Potter has overseen the production of nearly 2m cannabis plants, mostly for medical research or the production of the cannabis-based multiple sclerosis drug Sativex. He is director of botany and cultivation for GW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is exploring how cannabis could help treat a range of illnesses ranging from epilepsy to cancer. Recently Potter and GW\u2019s team have turned their attention to developing a cannabis-based treatment for psychosis and related illnesses such as schizophrenia. For a drug that is widely seen as a trigger for acute psychotic illness in young users, this at first sounds preposterous. But, as Potter explains, the cannabis plant is much more than just a psychedelic weed. \u201cThe most well-known ingredient in cannabis that gets people high is THC [or tetrahydrocannabinol],\u201d says Potter, who often travels to give talks in London carrying a suspicious-smelling suitcase of the plants. \u201cBut THC is just one of dozens of potentially useful cannabinoids in the plant.\u201d Cannabinoids are chemicals that act on the brain\u2019s cannabinoid receptors, part of a system that regulates a variety of physiological processes including pain sensation, mood, memory and appetite. In high doses, THC can induce temporary schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms such as paranoia, delusions, anxiety and hallucinations. Yet cannabis also contains a cannabinoid known as CBD (or cannabidiol), which appears to have almost the exact opposite effect. Purified CBD has been shown to have antipsychotic and anti-anxiety effects, and can lessen the psychotic symptoms normally experienced by people given high doses of THC. Research by University College London also suggests that people who smoke cannabis rich in CBD are less likely to experience \u201cschizophrenia-like symptoms\u201d than those who smoke cannabis containing only THC. Unfortunately for the mental health of many young cannabis users, the chemical profile of the drug has changed drastically over the past three decades. Not only does modern cannabis contain more than twice as much THC as it did in the 1960s, it also now contains hardly any of the \u201cneuroprotective\u201d cannabinoid CBD. Potter has analysed countless samples of street cannabis on behalf of the Home Office and the police, in parallel to his work cultivating the plant for medical research. With this \u201clibrary\u201d of cannabis samples and seeds stretching back decades, he has been able to track exactly how cannabis has changed. The origins of modern cannabis can be traced to California in the late 1970s, when professional breeders began to select the most potent, THC-rich plants for the first time. \u201cUntil then, most cannabis came in the form of hashish resin, made of mixed populations of plants from parts of Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, containing varying amounts of both CBD and THC,\u201d says Potter.    In the quest to make ever-stronger cannabis, growers may have inadvertently bred out a protective chemical    Due to the complex genetics of the cannabis plant, growers selectively breeding THC-rich plants were also selecting against the gene that produces CBD. In other words, in the quest to make ever stronger cannabis, illicit growers may have inadvertently bred out a chemical that protected the mental health of users in the past. \u201cWhen skunk was created the people doing it had no idea they were altering the ratios of CBD and THC \u2013 they just kept breeding the plants that gave the strongest high and threw the rest away.\u201d By 1984, a variety of cannabis known as \u201cskunk#1\u201d arrived in Europe. Named after its pungent smell, it contained 15% THC instead of the 1-8% found in older varieties. Pot smokers in the UK never looked back and skunk is now by far the most prevalent type of cannabis sold illegally here. By 2004-5, Potter could find hardly any traces of CBD at all in a batch of 500 seized cannabis samples given to him for analysis by the Home Office. The exact effect this change has had on the mental health of cannabis users is hard to say \u2013 the link between cannabis and schizophrenia remains complex and controversial. Researchers have struggled to prove whether cannabis causes psychosis, or whether people predisposed to psychosis are just more likely to smoke cannabis. The best evidence currently suggests that in people who are genetically at risk of schizophrenia, regular cannabis use doubles their risk of experiencing psychotic symptoms. But no long-term studies of people with schizophrenia have chemically analysed the type of cannabis the subjects were smoking. Potter has seen the extreme effects of both substance abuse and schizophrenia in his role as a magistrate for his local court. He recounts a recent case where a seemingly pleasant teenager, suffering from acute and sudden psychotic illness, had turned to alcohol and become violent. \u201cHe ended up smashing someone\u2019s teeth out for not really any reason at all,\u201d says Potter. The defendant, now diagnosed and medicated, will still be found guilty despite his temporary insanity. \u201cIn court it just struck me what a nice chap he was.\u201d The need for new antipsychotic drugs is pressing. Around 0.5% of the population are thought to suffer from schizophrenia \u2013 as many as 20-30 million at any one time globally \u2013 and around a third of those do not respond to antipsychotics. Existing medication does little to treat the other disabling symptoms of the disease \u2013 chronic inflammation, low mood, anxiety, and cognitive impairment \u2013 and often has worrying side-effects including weight gain, involuntary movements and drowsiness. All antipsychotics act primarily by altering the brain\u2019s production of dopamine, and the fact that CBD acts in a different way could be helpful for that third of people with schizophrenia who don\u2019t respond to existing drugs. Research suggests CBD, with its anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiety effect, could also help treat schizophrenia\u2019s broader symptoms, not just the psychosis.     Skunk, which is now by far the most prevalent type of cannabis sold illegally in the UK.  Photograph: Michel Porro/Getty Images    Results from double-blind, phase II clinical trials for CBD as a schizophrenia treatment will report next year. For now hopes rest on a small trial involving 39 patients with schizophrenia, 19 of whom were given the antipsychotic drug amisulpride, the rest CBD. At the end of the four-week trial, both groups showed significant improvement in their symptoms, but the CBD cohort reported far fewer side effects. Potter and his team remain cautious, as it is not yet fully understood how CBD actually works \u2013 it is simplistic to say CBD just does the opposite of the psychosis-inducing THC. One theory is that CBD boosts the activity of other cannabinoids produced naturally by the brain. Irrespective of the results of GW\u2019s clinical trials, research from around the world on CBD seems to have kick-started a movement among some cannabis users to switch to CBD-rich varieties in the hope of a safer, more mellow drug. Supposedly CBD-rich cannabis products are now being sold by \u201ctherapeutic\u201d retailers from Amsterdam to San Francisco \u2013 and if more research finds CBD-rich cannabis really is significantly safer than skunk, it could strengthen the case for the legalisation and regulation of cannabis products. Potter is passionate about cannabis, but he is not a politician. He does not wish to enter the debate about legalisation, and doesn\u2019t advocate any type of smoking because of its dire health implications. All of the medicines GW develops are administered in traditional routes such as throat sprays or liquids, and none get users high. He now boasts that his plants have as much CBD as there is THC in the strongest skunk, after years of selective breeding in the opposite direction by illegal producers. It has taken him more than a decade to get to a point where he can grow both CBD- and THC-rich cannabis of consistent strength on a wide scale. When he tried to find CBD-rich varieties with which to conduct medical research in the late 90s, 97% of commercially available seedlings created THC-dominant plants. \u201cSeeds for CBD-rich plants were extremely difficult to find,\u201d he recounts. \u201cIt took me to all sorts of places, including one quite strange shop in Amsterdam. \u201cWe can now produce plants of up to 15% CBD, way more than you would find naturally. But it\u2019s our productivity that is really much higher than illegal growers,\u201d he says proudly. The surreal, secret glasshouse in which Potter works understandably involved extensive discussions around security before the government would grant a licence. So far, says Potter, no attempts have been made on the bounty inside. Half of the tens of thousands of plants growing here at any one time are CBD-rich, half THC-rich. The two varieties are harvested; the cannabinoids extracted and blended in different ratios for different therapeutic effects. It\u2019s unlikely any intruders would be able to distinguish between the two varieties anyway \u2013 half would be utterly useless to recreational users. But thanks to the promise CBD has shown in a range of therapies under investigation, Potter\u2019s CBD-rich crop is potentially much more valuable than the THC crop. He admits it is \u201ca thrill\u201d to work with a plant with so many cultural and spiritual connections. He describes the rare, original skunk#1 plants from California, which now reside in GW\u2019s plant library, as having \u201csignificant social history\u201d in the way they changed cannabis and its image for ever. Perhaps his latest crop, rich in CBD and low in THC, will be the next cannabis plant of significant importance to society. There\u2019s one final question you have to ask a man who has overseen the production of millions of cannabis plants and who has samples of some the strongest skunk ever seized in the UK in his office. Has he ever got \u201chigh off his own supply\u201d, as they say? \u201cI never have, and it\u2019s probably best to keep that genie in the bottle,\u201d says Potter. \u201cIf I find I like it and I\u2019m surrounded by it all day it might be a bit of a problem.\u201d MEDICINAL CANNABIS: Current therapeutic usage Cannabinoids from the cannabis plant are being explored for a range of therapeutic uses. Medicinal cannabis extracts are currently prescribed in a number of countries to alleviate pain, treat muscle spasticity, and reduce nausea during chemotherapy. CBD (cannabidiol) is being investigated as a potential treatment for epilepsy, diabetes, appetite-loss, a range of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, and psychosis and schizophrenia. The compound has also been found to be a potent antioxidant and even appears to inhibit cancer cell growth in certain rare cancers. The fact that chemicals produced by cannabis interact with key receptors in the body is purely a coincidence, it is believed. Cannabinoids are thought to be merely a defensive mechanism to protect the plant against predators and harsh environmental conditions. A mixture of dozens of cannabinoids and bitter-tasting oils are produced in special structures called trichomes, tiny membrane-bound globules which are mostly clustered around the flowers of the plant. When an invading insect breaks the delicate membrane of the globule, volatile oils evaporate off, like in a solvent-based adhesive, and the insect is glued to the plant in seconds. THC, therefore, much revered for its psychedelic effects, is nothing more than an ingredient in nature\u2019s Loctite, it seems.

Radical teachers in the state of Michoac\u00e1n put 22 municipal halls under siege on Thursday, while students blocked roads in Chiapas and protesters in Oaxaca commandeered the contents of several vans distributing junk food, promising to send them to Ayotzinapa. Roadblocks, bus hijackings and assaults on public buildings continued in different parts of Mexico on Friday, while Pe\u00f1a Nieto found the disappeared students\u2019 case pursued him to Australia where the Mexican community organised demonstrations in Brisbane, Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. The most significant thing the president said during his trip was on an outward stopover in Alaska, when he condemned an arson attack on the door of the ceremonial presidential palace in Mexico City. \u201cMexican society says no to violence,\u201d he said, referring to the burning door. \u201cWe say yes to justice, order, harmony, tranquillity, and we say yes to the application of justice.\u201d The president made no mention of the fact that, immediately before the door was set on fire, the streets of the capital were filled with thousands of peaceful demonstrators. Many had carried banners proclaiming \u201cya me cans\u00e9\u201d, which means \u201cI\u2019m tired\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve had enough\u201d. The phrase was used by the attorney general, Jes\u00fas Murillo Karam, to cut short questions at the end of a press conference two days earlier, in which he had revealed the government\u2019s new claim that the students were probably massacred in a rubbish tip not far from Iguala, hours after they had been arrested by municipal police and handed over to a local drug gang called Guerreros Unidos on 26 September. Murillo said forensic examinations had corroborated gang members\u2019 confessions that they piled the bodies of about 40 young people on to a huge funeral pyre that burned for about 15 hours, leaving only ashes and a few bone fragments to be collected in plastic bags and dumped in a nearby river. The fragments were sent to a specialist lab in Austria last week to see if identification was still possible. Many parents, clinging to the hope that their children were still alive, said they doubted that such a fire could really cremate so many people. Some said it was raining on the night of the terror. They drew the saddest kind of comfort from last week\u2019s news that DNA tests have ruled out that any of the students were among the 38 bodies recovered earlier from nine mass graves in the outskirts of Iguala. \u201cThey are hidden somewhere,\u201d Clemente Rodr\u00edguez, father of Christian, told Associated Press. \u201cI hope they\u2019re going to let them go any day now.\u201d Even those convinced by the rubbish tip narrative point out how long it took the authorities to find something that must have been so blatant. Then there are the questions left unanswered, such as why they were killed, and how the government could claim that this was not a crime by the state. \u201cA crime of state is much more serious,\u201d Murillo had said at the now infamous press conference. \u201cThe state is not Iguala.\u201d The government\u2019s efforts to contain the fallout to local politics dodges the protesters\u2019 demand to know how the federal authorities did nothing about the collusion of the city\u2019s municipal authorities with Guerreros Unidos. They had known for over a year that mayor Jos\u00e9 Luis Abarca, whom they now accuse of ordering the attack on the students, had been accused in 2013 of shooting a kidnapped activist in the face. There were longstanding reports of checkpoints into the city set up by the municipal police and the gang. On the night itself, the army remained in its barracks, just a few minutes from where the students were being attacked and disappeared over a period of hours. \u201cThere is simply no way the army did not know what was going on,\u201d said political commentator Raymundo Riva Palacio, who specialises in security issues. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is whether they didn\u2019t go to help the population because of collusion or omission.\u201d Riva Palacio insisted that the combination of generalised public anger, uniting the poverty-stricken rural families of the students with middle-class city dwellers, is providing the small but resilient guerrilla groups that have long roamed the mountains of Guerrero with a golden opportunity to try to deepen the contradictions in an effort to provoke an insurrection. There are also, he said, rumblings of discontent among the business elite. \u201cThe incapacity of the government is so serious that, if things don\u2019t change, the only thing they are going to end up doing is repressing the protest movement,\u201d he said. Some, including security expert Buscaglia, hope that the protest movement could develop into a peaceful force, with clear proposals for cleaning up the \u201ccorrupt political-business mafia\u201d that will gather such momentum that politicians will have to comply. \u201cI don\u2019t see this happening yet,\u201d he said, but added that he didn\u2019t see the social protest movement fading away. \u201cThe government may be successful making Iguala disappear behind a lot of smoke and mirrors, but there are 22,000 disappeared people in Mexico, and every new mass grave that is found will be a trigger for more social pressure.\u201d", "sentences": ["In Amsterdam, chants of \u201cJustice!\u201d rang out from Mexican fans at the 43rd minute of a friendly football match with Holland."], "title": "Mexico\u2019s president faces wave of fury across country over fate of missing student teachers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/16/mexico-parents-missing-students-refuse-to-be-forgotten", "tags": ["Mexico", "Americas", "Human rights", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-16T14:42:32Z", "article": "Dutch experts working in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine have recovered more human remains at the crash site of Malaysian Airlines flight 17 as they began collecting debris. The remains of 289 victims had been previously identified, but nine bodies were still lost. The latest remains were only discovered now because they had been damaged by fire during the crash, an observer with the Organisation for Securtiy and Co-operation in Europe said on Ukrainian television. Experts reportedly retrieved one part of the plane\u2019s landing gear and a large piece of its fuselage from the crash site. The recovered fragments are to be loaded on trains and taken to the government-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. The investigation into the cause of the crash is being conducted there and in the Netherlands. All 298 people aboard the Boeing 777 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur were killed when it was shot down on 17 July over a rebel-held area. Charred remains of the aircraft are scattered across fields covering an area of 20 sq km. Efforts to conduct investigations and recovery operations have been delayed amid continued fighting between government troops and separatist fighters. A truce was agreed in September, but hostilities have raged on nonetheless. A new video from the crash site moments after the plane went down also surfaced on Sunday showing locals trying to gather buckets of water to pour on burning debris. The video was apparently filmed in Hrabove, one of the towns where debris from the plane fell. In the video, one resident can be heard in the background saying \u201ca rocket was fired.\u201d Kiev and the West suspect that a Buk surface-to-air missile brought down the plane, while the Russian authorities have argued that a Ukrainian fighter jet shot it down. At the end of the G20 meeting in Australia, president Barack Obama said Western sanctions against Russia would continue, although he said additional ones would not be adopted for the time being. Obama accused Moscow of continuing to provide arms to pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. \u201cWe\u2019re also very firm on the need to uphold core international principles, and one of those principles is you don\u2019t invade other countries or finance proxies and support them in ways that break up a country that has mechanisms for democratic elections,\u201d Obama told reporters. The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, has been particularly critical of Russia since the Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down. Abbott said he and Putin had engaged in a \u201cvery robust\u201d discussion about the situation in Ukraine. \u201cI utterly deplore what seems to be happening in eastern Ukraine,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cI demand that Russia fully cooperates with the investigation, the criminal investigation of the downing of MH17, one of the most terrible atrocities of recent times.\u201d Also on Sunday, a new humanitarian convoy of more than 70 trucks from Russia arrived in Luhansk, the seventh such convoy to be dispatched. A video from the pro-Russian ANNA news agency showed the convoy driving down the highway flying the flags of Russia and the emergencies ministry. At least nine fuel trucks could be seen in the video, and another segment showed emergencies ministry workers unloading barrels with the logo of Russian state oil champion Rosneft on the side from other trucks.

Two black British men check my ticket at the barrier and a Sikh guard is on the platform. The train to Gatwick is full of foreigners. Last month, a Ukip organiser on Humberside complained to me that \u201cwe are not even allowed to use the word foreigners any more\u201d. Clearly that\u2019s not true, as I\u2019ve just used it here, but it probably wouldn\u2019t have been my word of choice. It feels more like terminology from the past, like \u201clabour exchange\u201d or \u201cwireless\u201d used to describe a radio. The reason it has become meaningless is that one in six British people are not white, and about one in four non-British migrants are white European. People whose attitudes and language were formed when Britain was a white, monocultural society have lived not only through the most dramatic change in this country\u2019s ethnic makeup. They have also lived through a parallel legislative revolution in which words, attitudes and behaviours that were normal in 1945 are now illegal. The result, argues social geographer Gill Valentine, is the \u201cprivatisation of prejudice\u201d. In a research project at Sheffield University [PDF], Valentine has documented a widespread resentment of the impact of equality legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re being dictated to and controlled in what you can say and what you think,\u201d says one woman interviewed for the study. Such resentments are barely acknowledged in mainstream politics but may, Valentine believes, have become the invisible driver of political radicalisation on the right. The laws referred to are indeed comprehensive. The 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam obliged EU countries to protect their citizens from racial and sexual discrimination. The Equalities Act 2010 demands equal treatment across public life regardless of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. The result has been to make language and behaviour in corporate and public space highly regulated: but in the realm of the brain, the pub, the private conversation and of course the internet \u2013 everything is possible. Valentine\u2019s interviews reveal that people who don\u2019t agree with equality legislation develop ways of \u201csubverting\u201d what they see as political correctness \u2013 and that they are particularly bitter that the workplace has become so highly regulated in terms of language and behaviour. Put simply: there\u2019s a liberal culture and a racist, sexist and homophobic subculture in Britain \u2013 and while we are all too aware of this on, say, Twitter, where it can be open, the place it really matters is where it can\u2019t be properly addressed: public space and work. Having an official culture and an unofficial subculture is not a new thing. But forcing a whole previous official ideology underground is new. When you can walk past Liverpool town hall and see statues of curly-headed black slaves carved into the stone work, you can\u2019t be surprised that attitudes of ethnic supremacy and other imperial-era prejudices die hard. Valentine\u2019s findings chime with my experience as a TV reporter required to do vox pops. Over the past three years, I\u2019ve noticed a growing tendency for people to say: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what I think,\u201d when it comes to immigration. This is not a product of increased reticence. Instead it reflects a rising awareness of \u2013 and reaction to \u2013 the legal limits to expression. In the Sheffield research, a white man describes using subterfuge to get away with abusing Muslim women in public. He pretends to accidentally block their path, quietly insulting them and then claiming they\u2019ve misheard: \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be very careful \u2013 see if security overhear, they\u2019ll march you out \u2026 They think we should treat them as equal, and I don\u2019t because they\u2019re not.\u201d Not until you\u2019re on the receiving end of this can you understand how prevalent it is \u2013 not just for Muslims but for many victims of prejudice \u2013 and how little the official culture of toleration has done to erode the underlying attitudes that cause it. Indeed, Valentine\u2019s interviews show these attitudes are not the preserve of the over-60s: they are being replicated among the young. If racist attitudes are being in effect privatised \u2013 going underground to be expressed in defiance of mainstream culture \u2013 that is the opposite of what the equality legislation intended. It turns the covert racist and homophobe into a self-styled linguistic Robin Hood. It feeds the politics of the far right with the thrill of a shared defiance that all subcultures generate. And it puts anti-racists into a false comfort zone, where it feels like the basic arguments against prejudice no longer need to be put. So in a tolerant society, and in corporations whose internal culture is governed by equality law, we have to find new ways to meet this challenge, beyond legislation. Maybe the new deal should be: you \u2013 the racists and homophobes \u2013 are allowed to say what you think and we, the majority of society who are signed up to the principles of toleration, are allowed to disagree more vehemently than at present. \u201cCelebrating diversity\u201d is a strategy that works only when other people are not cursing it under their breath. Maybe we should all front up and say things more clearly. Maybe NHS hospitals should advertise: \u201cWe can only run this place with \u2018foreigners\u2019 \u2013 you got a problem with that?\u201d And maybe businesses could adopt the slogan: \u201cWe\u2019re as black, brown, gay, straight, disabled and \u2018foreign\u2019 as Britain is, and proud of it \u2013 feel free to take your money and prejudices somewhere else.\u201d Instead of political correctness you would then have political honesty. It would be uglier but more real. Paul Mason is economics editor at Channel 4 News.

The 26-year-old man, who can only be referred to as CF, lived in Dartmouth Park, north London, close to the home of Labour leader Ed Miliband. He has a long history of involvement with groups linked to al-Qaida and is thought to have been seeking to join the Islamic State (Isis), sources say. CF had been placed under terrorism prevention and investigation measures, (Tpim) but the orders expire after two years and his was lifted in January this year. At that stage, Theresa May used her powers under the royal prerogative to remove the man\u2019s passport and prevent him seeking to join terrorists abroad. The man\u2019s departure is likely to embarrass the Home Office and calls into question the effectiveness of the Tpim measures which the government is seeking to use on a more regular basis. CF is thought to have hidden in the back of a lorry to reach Belgium, where he sought to obtain a forged British passport. Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, said Labour had warned Theresa May that weakening counter terrorism powers would be a \u201cserious mistake\u201d. \u201cThis is another example of the failure of her Tpims to keep track of terror suspects. Without Tpims, the Home Office said other arrangements would be in place to manage these suspects, but its clear they aren\u2019t satisfactory. \u201cTheresa May took the decision to weaken these counter-terrorism powers \u2013 she must answer for the disappearance of this suspect, even when his passport has reportedly been removed. It\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Cooper said. The disappearance of CF has emerged after another man who fled the country, while on bail for sectarian violence, has appeared in a video for the Pakistani Taliban. Mirza Ali, 38, a doctor from Chichester Wharf, Erith, Kent, was among 12 extremists sentenced to up to two years each in June after violence from Syria spilled on to the streets of central London during a demonstration calling for jihad. Ali skipped bail and travelled to Croatia. From there, he was deported to Pakistan and has appeared in a recruitment video for terrorist group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan Jamaat ul-Ahrar. He was jailed for 15 months in his absence. Eight days after the first incident, ten of the group launched an attack on football fans drinking in a gay bar. One of the men involved in that fight \u2013 Abu Rahin Aziz, 32, from Luton who has two children \u2013 has also skipped bail and travelled to Syria through Amsterdam. He was jailed for 36 weeks in his absence. CF is believed to be an associate of Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, who fled from a mosque last November dressed in a burqa while under a Tpim.   Isis timeline   He also knew Ibrahim Magag who escaped from a Tpim on Boxing Day 2012 after apparently jumping in a cab at Euston station in London. CF has a history of involvement with terrorist groups dating back six years. In 2008 he allegedly attempted to travel to Afghanistan to fight \u201cjihad\u201d and engage in suicide operations alongside another man. He was arrested and charged with seeking terrorism training overseas but while electronically tagged on bail, he absconded using a false Portuguese passport. He travelled to Somalia in June 2009 where he allegedly attended a terrorist training camp and was involved in fighting alongside al-Shabaab, a group linked to al-Qaeda that was behind the Westgate Shopping Centre massacre. From there, he is said to have provided advice on travelling to Somalia to others and attempted to recruit fighters in Britain to join them, including offering to help another man to travel to Somalia in 2010. He was also engaged in seeking funds for al-Shabaab and may have been involved in planning attacks. Shortly before his arrest, he was allegedly involved with Mohammed Mohamed\u2019s plans to attack Western interests in Somaliland. Mohamed\u2019s plans had included an attack on the Juba Hotel in Mogadishu in August 2010. CF was arrested by Somaliland authorities alongside Mohammed Mohamed in Burao on January 14 2011 and detained in Hargeisa Prison for two months before being deported back to Britain where he was put under a TPIM. In a High Court judgment, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones said CF had played a \u201csubstantial role\u201d in the British network in Somalia and that his involvement was \u201cundoubtedly real and substantial.\u201d \u201cI am entirely satisfied that the Secretary of State was and remains reasonably entitled to hold a reasonable suspicion and a reasonable belief that CF had engaged in terrorism-related activity,\u201d he added.

And even for those uncompelled by his efforts at Malmo and Halmstad, guiding Switzerland to the last 16 of their first World Cup since 1966, followed by the final stages of Euro 96, were fine accomplishments \u2013 so too, more recently, taking Fulham to a European final. The thing is, these teams were marked by solidity rather than creativity, an emphasis that does not suit England\u2019s current squad, and the appointment of Gary Neville as coach is just one example evidencing an unwillingness to change. There is no shame in this. To use Hodgson\u2019s own comparison, Alex Ferguson was rarely seen on the training ground in the latter part of his career - he focused on his forte of man-management, backing his ability to delegate effectively. So, when his defence needed sorting, he simply let the expert get on with it. It is unlikely that Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra arrived on account of the hours Fergie spent watching Spartak Moscow and Monaco, and subsequently, they, along with Edwin van der Sar, Rio Ferdinand, Wes Brown and John O\u2019Shea, were drilled by Carlos Queiroz. The result was a European Cup won with only two goals conceded in the knockout stages, and a league record for consecutive clean sheets. Which is to say that it\u2019s fine not to be good at everything, because no one is, and that the skill is appreciating that and compensating accordingly. The appointment of a coach with attacking expertise would do England no harm.

But Louis van Gaal has since departed, and, forsaken by the freakishness that sustained his summer, been unable to coax very much from Robin van Persie - likewise his successor, Guus Hiddink. On the evidence of the season so far, Van Persie is now simply a goalscorer, declining to participate in general play nor harry defenders in possession, especially worrying for a man whose brilliance was largely unrelated to his athleticism. And even his finishing has been off; he has as many bookings as league goals, his tally of three requiring ten games and a panoply of eminently convertible chances. But, last night, he looked closer to his old self. His movement in the box allowed him to score Holland\u2019s crucial first goal, and after that, his link-up play was selfless and perceptive. Latvia, though, were obliging opponents; more thorough examinations are to come. DH  \u2022 Daley Blind suffers knee injury in Holland win  El Shaarawy offers element of surprise     Stephan El Shaarawy. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP    Italy are no longer an international force. Serie A contains the fewest homegrown players of any major European league, and unlike the Premier League, which is next to bottom, it has very few foreigners of elite level, while the best Italian youngster, Marco Verratti, plays in France. So it was unsurprising that they were largely outplayed by Croatia, even with their traditional qualities of composure and know-how absent for the most part. It is true that Verratti and Andrea Pirlo were injured, but that only made it all the more unwise that Stephan El Shaarawy was omitted from the starting XI. If a team is deprived of its metronome and deputy, a player able to do the unexpected might have compensated in other ways. Though El Shaarawy recently went 622 days without a league goal, he broke that run immediately prior to joining up with the national squad, cried with relief, and, when he came on, looked full of confidence and conviction. In a team lacking both, this rare domestic product should be an invaluable asset. DH  \u2022 Uefa to investigate Italy-Croatia crowd trouble  O\u2019Neill needs to find new firepower It is a worry which has hung over the Republic of Ireland for several years but was accentuated once more against Scotland on Friday night. When the time finally comes for Robbie Keane to retire they will be desperately short of goalscorers. Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s decision to start Shane Long instead of Keane, who was dropped for the first time in 13 years, was the Southampton attacker\u2019s big chance to prove he is capable of succeeding Keane. Instead Long struggled as the Irish attack appeared bereft of craft in Glasgow. The jury remains out on the 27-year-old\u2019s goalscoring ability, while Keane, 34, aired his own grievances by saying O\u2019Neill\u2019s preference for one up top does not suit him because \u201cI\u2019m not fucking Niall Quinn or Shane Long\u201d. Keane has returned to LA before Tuesday\u2019s friendly at home to the USA, so Long will likely be given another shot to improve a very average tally of 11 goals from 50 appearances.

The serious business of earning three points towards qualification completed successfully, they should even approach Tuesday\u2019s friendly relaxed. Gordon Strachan, playing a PR trump card prior to the Ireland win, said Celtic Park would become Scotland\u2019s Park for these fixtures but there is almost a sense of apathy among supporters due to inflated ticket prices. Warnings of a huge security operation makes it even less attractive and with an estimated couple of thousand fans locked outside 15 minutes after kick-off on Friday, it is little wonder plenty of tickets remain at \u00a360 a pop despite the impressive upturn shown by Strachan\u2019s team. AS  \u2022 Hodgson: Scotland game is exactly what we need\u2022 Scotland\u2019s Hanley: Wembley defeat will spur us on  Roy Carroll endured a busy weekend In an era where commitment to the cause is often questioned, the Northern Ireland goalkeeper Roy Carroll deserves to be commended for his efforts. He left the pitch in Bucharest defeated at 11.45pm local time on Friday night, returned to the team hotel where he had \u201ctwo to three hours sleep\u201d and was on a flight back to London at 6.10am. From there he drove to Coventry for Notts County\u2019s 3pm kick-off in League One. He kept a clean sheet, though he could probably have brought a blanket with him as Coventry failed to register a shot on target. Afterwards he got back in his car and drove home before, one assumes, a good night\u2019s kip. AS  \u2022 Match report: Romania 2-0 Northern Ireland  Will Africa\u2019s finest be able to improvise in Equatorial Guinea? There is little doubt that the Confederation of African Football were desperate when choosing Equatorial Guinea to host January\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco\u2019s place. The tiny central African petrostate co-hosted with Gabon in 2012 amid some intense scrutiny of its human-rights record and this will doubtless continue; football-wise, it is almost impossible to believe that this has happened and that the country\u2019s third- and fourth-biggest stadia may be hosting the likes of Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Asamoah Gyan. Those venues are located in Ebebiyin, nestled by the borders with Gabon and Cameroon, and Mongomo, a remote town in the east. They hold 5,000 and 4,000 supporters respectively and their states of repair and completion are hard to discern. This is about as obscure as major tournament football can possibly get nowadays and a degree of patience and flexibility far beyond the norm will be required of all who descend upon settlements whose hotels appear to be countable on a couple of fingers. You wonder to what extent clubs will have taken note: Borussia Dortmund pulled Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Gabon\u2019s squad to play in Angola on Saturday on the pretext of concerns relating to Ebola, yet neither country has seen a single case of the illness. The Germans were able to take advantage of their striker being called up a day outside of Fifa\u2019s date for mandatory release, but you wonder what clubs might try in January when faced with the prospect of releasing high-worth players for a rushed tournament whose edges will be rougher than any in memory. Will they fancy giving their blessing to three weeks of competition of which a considerable part will take place in locations whose infrastructure and, more importantly, security are justifiably open to question? Regardless, an entertaining qualification tournament rumbled on over the weekend, with Senegal, Cameroon, Algeria and Zambia among the big names to join the new hosts \u2013 previously disqualified for fielding an ineligible player, making for a situation that sums up the desperation of this entire affair \u2013 in the hat. The others will be known on Wednesday but there is a nagging sense that we will be hearing more about this. Europe\u2019s leading powers will surely latch onto any impression that they are sending their stars into an unholy mess. Nick Ames  \u2022 Equatorial Guinea named new Africa Cup of Nations hosts  Bosnia may not be back for a while     Bosnia\u2019s Miralem Pjanic. Photograph: Ariel Schalit/AP    It was right that Bosnia-Herzegovina were seen as one of the World Cup\u2019s good news stories, even if their competition itself ended as a damp squib after an avoidable defeat to Nigeria. Their qualification had been a moment of affirmation for a country whose short life had been a troubled one and the joy that greeted it was worth far more than goals on a football field. But they have struggled since, and on Sunday they fell to a 3-0 defeat in Israel that leaves them winless after four games and will probably spell a messy end for coach Safet Susic, a provider of unfettered joy both on and off the pitch in times past. Bosnia were lacking their outstanding strike duo, Edin Dzeko and Vedad Ibisevic, and the coach\u2019s staggering unwillingness to name another centre-forward confirmed the fear that the squad\u2019s options run no deeper. Unfortunately their problems do, and an unbalanced, tactically lacking side is demonstrating the difficulty of relying on off-the-cuff attack when those who have made the side tick in recent years are unavailable, off form or \u2013 in Zvjezdan Misimovic\u2019s case \u2013 have retired from international football. Bosnia played well in drawing against Belgium last month and are not a lost cause, but something must change. \u201cThis can\u2019t go on. We can\u2019t continue like this. Everybody is guilty. Our FA, our coach, everyone,\u201d said the usually restrained Asmir Begovic after the game. The country lacks the resources, both in manpower and finance, of neighbours such as Serbia and Croatia so needs exceptional management to make the best of its lot. A period of reorganisation may be required before the Bosnians are capable of revisiting the heights of this time last year. NA  \u2022 Interview: Barry Glendenning meets Asmir Begovic  The Czechs are on for a quickfire qualification Most football watchers over 25 will be able to remember the wonderful Czech sides of 1996 and 2004. If the team that finished second to Germany at Euro 96 had probably performed to its limit, its successor eight years later was packed with top-class performers and missed a golden opportunity when losing to Greece in the last four. There is little likelihood of such feats being repeated quite yet but the Czechs are on the way back and, while their quarter-final appearance in 2012 owed more to perspiration and weak opponents than anything else, this side has a little more about it. Pavel Vrba\u2019s team were better than a much-lauded Iceland team in Plzen, winning through a strange own goal but controlling the game after falling behind early on, and now have four wins from four in Group A. They are six points clear of a third-placed Dutch side that they defeated 2-1 in September and, even if you suspect Guus Hiddink\u2019s men will return to their usual peerless qualifying form, will need a capitulation not to at least finish second. They host Latvia and Kazakhstan in two of their next three games, the other being a visit to Reykjavik, and will know that they have a golden opportunity to put things to bed soon enough to make the fiendish-looking match in Amsterdam that concludes their campaign an irrelevance.

If done properly, it broadens and enhances the way we see the world, getting us to think, feel and consider the space and issues around us in a new light. Below are 10 ads that we believe do just this. Despite often being coined as commercials, these ads are a real example of how the best advertising does more than sell things, it changes minds. 1. Nike: If You Let Me PlayThis film is a mini masterpiece which tackles a big issue in a very elegant way, with swagger and irony. The film has been often \u201cquoted\u201d in other work and even \u201cremade\u201d recently. But this is the real thing, which opened the way for many conversations about women and sport. It also changed the way sports brands address women in their advertising. 2. Benetton: HeartsOne of the most punchy ads ever made about racism. It\u2019s incredibly simple, almost clich\u00e9d, but it makes a great point and it\u2019s brilliantly executed. It\u2019s a very iconic image that has been used over and over throughout the years and still lives on as an internet meme. Google it. 3. Guardian News &amp; Media: Points of ViewAn excellent reminder of what the real role of a newspaper, and media in general, is in our society. A simple message that was delivered in a clever and provocative way. It\u2019s a powerful, almost perfect, short film that stays with the viewer for much longer than the 30 seconds it lasts. 4. Getup.org: It\u2019s TimeMany things have been said about gay marriage, with many individuals, brands and organisations involved in supporting equal marriage. This one piece of work has something unique to it in its simplicity. Not many words, not many statements. A matter-of-fact, uncontrived approach that goes straight to the point and ends up being very convincing. 5. Thai Health: Anti-SmokingThe great thing about this campaign is that there is no way you can disagree with its message and how it is delivered. Its logic is fantastic (it feels like you could apply it to other social issues too) and the execution is spot on. This campaign has been very impactful in Thailand but it could easily work around the world. 6. Honda: GrrThe interesting thing about this film \u2013 apart from being beautiful \u2013 is that it managed to speak in a fun, charming way about one of the major issues of our time. It made people smile and think about the impact they have on the environment. This campaign opened the way for other car companies to put eco-consciousness at the heart of their communication and vision. 7. Channel 4: Meet the SuperhumansChanging the general audience\u2019s perception of the Paralympic games was not an easy task. This excellent piece of work managed to do so \u2013 or started to do so \u2013 during London 2012. It\u2019s a powerful film that challenges our preconceptions. 8. The Conservative Party: Labour isn\u2019t WorkingThe best political ad ever? Stunningly simple, brutally effective, a classic bit of \u201880s work. Produced when the Tory-Saatchi partnership was at the top of its game. Whatever you think of the politics, this is a pollster\u2019s dream. 9. Jewish Council for Education and Research: The Great SchlepNot a one-off execution but a classic piece of ultra-targeted modern media. The beauty is in the impact \u2013 higher older voter turn-out and Florida goes to Obama. The combination of intelligence, humour and sheer chutzpah had a halo effect on broader culture, helping to position Obama as the distinct choice for progressive America. The Great Schlep is what a lot of campaigns try to be: it\u2019s effective, engaging and entertaining at once. 10. Westinghouse Electric: Rosie the Riveter \u2013 We Can Do ItA creation of the US Office of War in the second world war to spur on a newly female-powered economy, this advert might have glossed over reality (women were paid less to take on traditionally male jobs while also being expected to keep up the job of homemaker on the side and then promptly sent back home when men returned from the war and wanted to take back those jobs), but it remains one of the most powerful icons of feminism even today. If Beyonce mimics it fifty years on, an ads got staying power. A testament to the fact that the most powerful advertising isn\u2019t always perfect. These ads are all drawn from many different walks of life, subjects, industries and social issues. From politics and automotive, right up to energy and fashion, the unifying thread is their ability to help us think bigger than we otherwise would. At once witty, irreverent, deep and moving, these ads have and will not only stand the test of time, but have a genuine sociological impact.

Ride are to play their first shows in 20 years in May 2015, culminating in a headline show at the Field Day festival in London on Sunday 7 June. Though the band themselves had nothing to say about their return, the statement announcing it contained two messages in the form of quotes.  The first, from David Crosby, read: \u201cYour first band is like your first love; you never forget it, and you never feel quite the same way about any other band.\u201d The second, from the French economist Jacques Attali, read: \u201cIn noise can be read the codes of life, the relations among men. Clamour, Melody, Dissonance, Harmony; when it is fashioned by man with specific tools, when it invades man\u2019s time, when it becomes sound, noise is the source of the purpose and power, of the dream \u2013 Music.\u201d Beady Eye\u2019s split had led to strong rumours that Ride would reunite, and when photos of giant posters for next summer\u2019s Primavera festival bearing the band\u2019s logo were posted to social media on Tuesday, it appeared to be all but official. Now it is official.            The band \u2013 Andy Bell, Mark Gardener, Loz Colbert and Steve Queralt \u2013 formed in 1988, and signed to Creation in 1989. A series of three EPs \u2013 Ride, Play and Fall \u2013 made them indie sensations, followed by a self titled debut album in 1990, which became the first Creation album to enter the top 75. By the time the band split, before the release of their final album Tarantula in 1996, relations between Gardener and Bell were all but non-existent.  Their previous album, Carnival of Light, had seen the two men\u2019s songs appear separately on either side of the record. \u201cImagine an argument where the way you win, is by saying \u2018I don\u2019t want my songs on the same side of the album as yours,\u2019 and it actually happens,\u201d Bell later said. \u201cWe were allowed by the people around us to behave like total babies.\u201d            The tension did ease, however, and in 2001 Ride came together for a one-off performance for TV, and the pair appeared together on stage in Stockholm when Gardener played there in 2003. Bell has had the most high profile career since Ride\u2019s breakup. His band Hurricane No 1 were briefly successful before he joined Oasis as bassist in 1999. When Oasis broke up in 2009, he followed Liam Gallagher to High Flying Birds. As is so often the case, their reputation has grown in their absence, with Nowhere appearing in Pitchfork\u2019s Top 100 albums of the 1990s.

This film is avowedly inspired by Anton Chekhov, and since its appearance at this year\u2019s Cannes film festival, critics have specifically identified in it Chekhov\u2019s stories Excellent People (1886) and The Wife (1892), although in an interview with me, the director denied having intended or created any sort of adaptation. Winter Sleep won the Palme d\u2019Or, and that was a triumph about which I had complicated feelings, perhaps like those of Ian McEwan fans when Amsterdam won the Booker prize in 1998. There was a sense that this wasn\u2019t quite the best contender, nor quite the winner\u2019s own best work \u2013 but nevertheless clearly that of a supremely praiseworthy, prizeworthy artist. It\u2019s a film whose geography has a daunting grandeur: the vast and wintry plain, with its rocky forms, often looks like that of an alien planet, or a planet on which the characters we see are the last humans left. This gigantic setting creates a mesmerising, if slightly mis-matched context for the pain, pathos and absurdity of a sharply observed, intimate domestic drama. Haluk Bilginer plays the insufferably conceited Aydin, a retired, middle-aged actor who has inherited his late parents\u2019 provincial hotel out here, along with the freehold of surrounding cottages. Running the business and collecting rent is delegated to his manager Hidayet (Ayberk Pekcan), allowing Aydin the leisure to write a smug, preposterous column for the local paper called the Voice of the Steppe, to bore his guests with memories of having once met Omar Sharif, and to patronise his beautiful young wife Nihal (Melisa S\u00f6zen) and divorced sister Necla (Demet Akbag). They have come to hate Aydin \u2013 and themselves \u2013for being dependent on his unearned wealth and trapped with him in this icy wasteland, far from the Istanbul they dream about. Bilginer\u2019s performance shows how Aydin has cultivated the style of a worldly man. It is a mask of knowing condescension that does not conceal his own loneliness, disappointment and fear.         Watch the trailer for Winter Sleep    Winter Sleep fascinates, saddens and occasionally amuses, at various points on its vast canvas, although I couldn\u2019t help feeling that the landscape\u2019s enormity worked better for Ceylan\u2019s more violently disturbing film Once Upon a Time in Anatolia (2011), and that the bittersweet Chekhovian pastoral here might have been more intelligible in a more metropolitan or at least less isolated and more socialised setting, such as his Uzak (Distant) of 2002, although I accept the important point is that they are isolated. Tellingly, and touchingly, poor Aydin prides himself on the seriousness of his lost thespian career and on never having done a soap opera. Nihal asks the spiky and self-dramatising Necla if she hasn\u2019t perhaps been watching too many soap operas. The awful truth is that their life is like a soap opera, but played out with a dreary and glacial slowness, even more oppressive in the hotel\u2019s winter off-season. The movie has an oceanic swell, or surge of emotion that appears to be building somewhere in its depths, but never quite breaks into a wave. In fact, the film\u2019s one real dramatic flourish, when Nihal meets Aydin\u2019s resentful tenant Ismail (Nejat Isler), seems overstated and misjudged. The extended dialogue scenes ring truer. Aydin will have long, bitter, subdued conversations with Neclan and Nihal separately, which take place in flickering firelight, as if the end of the world has come and there is no more electricity. They are conversations for which the audience must readjust their sense of conventional dramatic pace, in order to appreciate the unbearable pain and anger that everyone is afraid to express fully, for fear of admitting to the world their own anguish. The first shot in Winter Sleep is of a smoke or steam wispily rising from the soil (oddly, I thought of the hellish vapour coming from the grate in Scorsese\u2019s Taxi Driver). The land is like a fen or a bayou, alternately icy and muddy, essentially hostile, habitable only at enormous human cost: a vision of its inhabitants\u2019 mental landscape. Ceylan paints an absorbing, compassionate portrait of people who are making a painful accommodation with each other, and with a world that rejected them long before they thought about rejecting it. \u2022 Xan Brooks\u2019 first-look review of Winter sleep \u2022 Nuri Bilge Ceylan on Winter Sleep: \u2018I don\u2019t like comedies \u2013 I don\u2019t like to laugh\u2019", "sentences": ["Winter Sleep won the Palme d\u2019Or, and that was a triumph about which I had complicated feelings, perhaps like those of Ian McEwan fans when Amsterdam won the Booker prize in 1998."], "title": "Winter Sleep review | Peter Bradshaw\u2019s film of the week", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/winter-sleep-review-nuri-bilge-ceylan", "tags": ["Winter Sleep", "Drama", "Film", "Culture", "Anton Chekhov"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-22T02:33:05Z", "article": "What is light rail, anyway? As the saying about good and bad art goes, it\u2019s the kind of thing that you know when you see it. It tends to defy strict definitions, though: there are streetcars that run on rails in the street, there\u2019s light rail that looks like train transport, but a bit smaller, there are trams that everyone knows about because they\u2019re old and heritagey. It\u2019s very difficult to draw meaningful distinctions.  What we do know about them is that they\u2019re very dominant in streetspace, and they\u2019re very definitely not cars, trucks, or buses. The one thing all these light rail modes have got in common is that they\u2019re very fashionable right now. People in every city seem to want some of them. Those cities that do have them \u2013 like Melbourne, with its ubiquitous \u201cLove Your Trams\u201d slogan \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. It\u2019s so fashionable to have opinions about trams that the ACT\u2019s next territory election is shaping up as a referendum on its capital metro light rail project. The 2015 election will pit the supporters (Labor and the Greens) against critics (the Coalition) of Canberra\u2019s planned line, from Civic along Northbourne Avenue to Gunghalin.  Last month David Hughes, an ex-treasury academic and economist, put a match under the already heated debate about Canberra trams, questioning the whole economic basis and the claimed benefits of the project. He may have a point, and it\u2019s always worth looking at actual numbers when we\u2019re talking about spending large amounts of public money. The numbers, though, aren\u2019t everything. Transport planning isn\u2019t \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 motivated by financial or planning evidence alone. The way we configure our cities in terms of the way we move about them, and the priority we give to different vehicles and modes in different areas of urban space, are critical parts of how we understand our own places. They\u2019re moving pieces of the city, and become, over time, deeply embedded in our collective understanding of what our cities are about.  It would be absurd to imagine, for instance, a modern London without its Tube or double-decker buses, or Los Angeles without its freeways, or Amsterdam or Copenhagen without packed crowds of cyclists. In each of those cases the use of technology (subways, highways, cycleways) drew from desires for progress and modernity at certain points: the late 19th century for Europe\u2019s underground rail, the car revolution for North American freeways, and the 1970s turn to environmentalism for cycling infrastructure. Right now, many Australian cities are exhibiting precisely this kind of desire for modernity in the form of light rail. The NSW government\u2019s minister for transport has defied that state\u2019s treasury by securing funding for the new CBD Light Rail, and is making supportive noises about another in Parramatta. The Gold Coast council boasts of its \u201cmajor step forward in transforming the [Gold Coast] into a modern, accessible destination\u201d, while Perth\u2019s Metro Area Express has retained its visionary language despite being \u201cdeferred\u201d by the state government.     \u2018Transport planning isn\u2019t \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 motivated by financial or planning evidence alone.\u2019  Photograph: AAP    It\u2019s a worldwide phenomenon. It\u2019s particularly prevalent in cities in North America, with their pattern of economically depressed central \u201cdowntowns\u201d and relatively sprawled suburban hinterlands. In places as disparate as Houston in Texas, St Louis in Missouri, Portland in Oregon, and Salt Lake City in Utah, pro-light rail groups have successfully argued for the introduction of streetcars and light rail to renew slumped economies, increase property prices, and to modernise their city centres. Light rail, the argument goes, is inherently attractive to to investors, developers, as well as passengers, in a way that other modes of transport aren\u2019t, because of its permanence and dominance in the streetspace. Jennifer Keesmat, the chief planner of Toronto wrote perhaps the best distillation of this prevailing attitude towards light rail technology:  \u201cWe will miss the mark once again if we treat this investment as simply a transit infrastructure project, as opposed to a critical city-building initiative ... We must transform our main transit avenues into the future city, the city we desire, the place that we are seeking to become.\u201d   Light rail is transformative, almost magically so. This kind of language, and desire for transformation and renewal, is about some very fundamental change to the urban form, and of the relationship of government to that space. It\u2019s no wonder it frustrates economists, who rightly see business cases being imaginatively enlarged upon, and the thumb of rhetoric lying heavily on one side of the cost-to-benefits scales.  It\u2019s about politics and imagination, and it always has been. Rail modes of transport, to an extent that almost no other mode does, requires the active involvement and support of government; in planning, in authorising new development and new density, in resuming land and consenting to thoroughfares, and not least in contributing money.  Trams are a physical symbol of specific kinds of local and state/territory government policy: long-term, because of rail\u2019s inflexibility; developmentalist, because the economics demands it; environmentalist, because they run on electricity; and pump-priming in a Keynesian way that, unlike the shiny vehicles themselves, has for 30 years been distinctly unfashionable. We argue about light rail against buses, against cars, and against an infinite number of other modes.  All the engineering and economic assessment will not change the fundamental argument, though: it\u2019s about imagination, and permanence, and commitment by the state to urban areas.", "sentences": ["It would be absurd to imagine, for instance, a modern London without its Tube or double-decker buses, or Los Angeles without its freeways, or Amsterdam or Copenhagen without packed crowds of cyclists."], "title": "Trams are back in fashion.

The conclusions of the all-party foreign affairs select committee \u2013 which says it is \u201cgravely concerned\u201d that allegations of torture are not being dealt with adequately and that families of Britons killed overseas often feel \u201centirely let down\u201d \u2013 will be a serious embarrassment to ministers. The report, based on evidence from members of the public who have had experience of consular services, former ambassadors, NGOs and other experts, suggests that cost-cutting and \u201cover-reliance on internet-based services\u201d risks dehumanising support systems in which personal contact should be central. The decision to end the issuing of British passports in FCO offices abroad, with all new applications now being dealt with in the UK, has also been deeply unpopular with the public, it says. The Foreign Office \u201cfailed to make clear the benefits of the new system or to address its drawbacks\u201d, the MPs say. Since 2010, the Foreign Office\u2019s budget has been slashed by 30%, from \u00a32.4bn to \u00a31.7bn, leading to the closure of many consular posts abroad and a drastic reduction in the number of permanent staff from the UK who are employed abroad. In early 2011 the FCO employed just over 5,000 civil servants from the UK, while 8,500 were hired locally in foreign countries. It now employs just over 4,600 permanent UK staff, while the number of locally hired staff has grown to 9,200. Since May 2010, the FCO has shut down 15 consular posts \u2013 nine of which are in Europe \u2013 while opening four new embassies with consular functions and upgrading others. The committee says it received \u201csubstantial anecdotal evidence\u201d to indicate that FCO services to bereaved families were \u201cinconsistent and have at times fallen well below the expected standards of the FCO, with repeated failures of communication and compassion\u201d. Diane Ashton, the mother of Stephen Ashton, who was killed, aged 22, at a full-moon party in Thailand on New Year\u2019s Eve 2012, told the inquiry that the level and nature of service from the Foreign Office following her son\u2019s death was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. \u201cMy experience is that the FCO, particularly in London, rely on detailed information being given over the telephone with no follow-up in writing. Taking in this detailed information and then remembering this days later is a huge task when you are in a complete state of shock. \u201cI recall at the time that I was in disbelief and found it quite incredible that we had received more formal correspondence from the Met police regarding my daughter\u2019s mobile phone that had been stolen just before Christmas than we had received from any public body about the death of Stephen.\u201d The FCO has also come under fire from the partner of a British man who is being detained in an African prison and has criticised the Foreign Office for in effect abandoning him to his fate. Florist Kirsty Thomas, 40, from Mottram in Greater Manchester, said Lee Talbot had been detained in Tunisia since early August with barely any support from the British government. So far, Talbot, 38, who works for Northern Rail, has received just one visit from an FCO official, with another due in mid-December. Thomas said: \u201cIt\u2019s beyond a joke really. There really isn\u2019t the help you\u2019d think that there would be. The consular service should be there to help, and help when you\u2019re in trouble, but it\u2019s not \u2013 you are on your own.\u201d     Lee Talbot has been detained in Tunisia since August.    Talbot was randomly drug tested while on holiday in Tunisia during the summer. The tests detected traces of cannabis ,which he had sampled during a trip to Amsterdam, two weeks earlier. Tunisia has mandatory sentencing for cannabis consumption, with serious charges that may even result in more than 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. \u201cThey [the Foreign Office] tell you one thing and then something else entirely. Their approach can be very contradictory,\u201d said Thomas. The handling of allegations by Britons of torture in prisons abroad was a particular worry to the committee. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the allegations we have received that the FCO has in some instances not responded adequately to protect and support those who said that they had been the victim of torture or ill-treatment. \u201cAny failure to support vulnerable nationals in such circumstances is deplorable. We recommend that the FCO launch an investigation into the allegations that have been raised during this inquiry, including identifying and interviewing staff involved, and that it present us with its findings.\u201d The MPs say that despite its shortcomings, the FCO can still be proud of what it does to help Britons overseas and their relatives. While they welcomed moves to offer more support online, the MPs said assurances from FCO staff that they were helping those who could not access digital services \u201cwere not borne out by the feedback we received\u201d. In a speech in April 2012 the then foreign secretary, William Hague, said the closure of some consulates had allowed new ones to be opened elsewhere. But the committee found there had been a clear net loss of services in the lifetime of the coalition government to date. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u201cThe committee\u2019s report recognises the high level of consular support staff provide to thousands of British nationals in distress overseas every year and the improvements we have already made. This is a priority for the Foreign Office. We have worked hard to improve our service and will continue to do so. This report will play an important role in this. We will consider the recommendations carefully and respond fully in due course. \u201cSome of the issues that the committee has identified, including our response to tragic murders abroad, are areas that we are already working to improve and we will consider the points that they have made.\u201d", "sentences": ["The tests detected traces of cannabis ,which he had sampled during a trip to Amsterdam, two weeks earlier."], "title": "Foreign Office condemned for failing Britons  in need of help", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/23/foreign-office-condemned-failing-britons-need-help", "tags": ["Foreign policy", "Politics", "UK news", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Tunisia", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-23T17:20:49Z", "article": "David Mackay, who has died aged 80, was a partner in the Barcelona architecture practice MBM (Martorell, Bohigas &amp; Mackay), which designed the athletes\u2019 village and harbour for Barcelona\u2019s 1992 Olympic Games and gained an international reputation for repairing and shaping cities. The career of the architect at the heart of the urban regeneration of Barcelona started in the 1960s, when he took a stand against the neglect and speculation that ravaged the city under Franco\u2019s dictatorship. It blossomed in the 80s, when the Socialist party that ran the city council responded to pressure from below to create more public space and convert post-industrial wastelands to housing and social use. The youngest of three brothers, Mackay spent his childhood in a series of boarding schools in England, Ireland and Scotland. His parents, Sonia and Fred, lived in India and Ghana (then the Gold Coast), where his father was a colonial administrator. Mackay\u2019s peripatetic early life made him feel he was from nowhere in particular. He would say that he contained some of all those countries and a large measure of Catalonia, where he lived for more than 50 years. After qualifying at North London Polytechnic in 1958, he moved to Barcelona with Roser Jarque, his Catalan wife, whom he had met when both were studying in London and married in 1957. In 1959 he started working with Josep Martorell and Oriol Bohigas, becoming a partner in 1962. The two architects, both eight years older than Mackay, were dedicated to introducing to Catalonia the ideas of the earlier modern movement \u2013 or rather, bringing them back: there had been a brief flowering of rationalist, social architecture between 1931 and 1936 under the Second Republic and before the civil war.     David Mackay. Photograph: MBM Arquitectes    In a city famed for its exotic Art Nouveau buildings, MBM followed a less glamorous path. The architects responded on social and ethical grounds to the uncontrolled speculative building boom of the 60s that destroyed much of Barcelona. Hostile to what Bohigas called the \u201cpersonalised exhibitionism\u201d of many famous architects, they fought for proper respect for, as Mackay defined it, a building\u2019s \u201cgiven environment\u201d. The 60s saw the building of many of their housing projects, such as the huge block on the otherwise bleak Meridiana Avenue, the main entry to Barcelona from the north. Mackay told me in 1998: \u201cArchitects have given up too easily their role in the architecture of cities, of the public space. It has been left to planning ... Most public space is addressed by engineers, trying to get a car somewhere as quickly as possible.\u201d MBM emphasised the social role of architecture: not just flashy buildings plonked anywhere, but the design of parks, such as the practice\u2019s magnificent Creueta del Coll in the 80s, libraries, schools and housing, which created space for pedestrians. In more than 500 highly varied projects, the majority in Barcelona, the architects did not insist on leaving their own stamp, but sought to respond to the social requirements of each commission. Mackay argued: \u201cWe\u2019re against urban planning, as it\u2019s known. There\u2019s a space between urban planning and architecture, which is urban design.\u201d MBM combated the then common zoning that has left many city centres empty at night, devoid of residents. They wanted a city where people could shop, live and work in any of its zones. Modern architecture, they believed, could be used to affirm creatively the identity of a city. Though never a member of any political party, Mackay took part in the 60s and 70s movement against the Franco dictatorship, dodging the riot police on demonstrations and helping activists to contact the foreign press. With his children packed into his Seat 600, he would on occasion interfere with police charges, making out he was lost or did not understand their instructions. In 1976 he was one of the founders of Amnesty International in Spain, an organisation that has frequently reproved the Spanish government for torture by its police forces. In the 80s MBM had the chance to design a whole neighbourhood. Mackay said: \u201cAfter observing the collapse of other cities due to town planning, there was the chance to put into practice the need to consider the city as a series of projects, as though it were a building. To design it.\u201d MBM was commissioned in 1984 to oversee the construction of the Olympic village. The most ambitious and complicated part of the Olympic building programme, the project involved rapidly creating a new seafront neighbourhood to replace abandoned factories and railways.     Design Museum of Barcelona, designed by MBM, 2013. Photograph: MBM    The Olympic village is not without its critics. It was supposed to offer cheap housing after the Games, but the Socialists\u2019 acceptance of market forces meant that the area became coveted and expensive. Yet it failed to attract businesses to its ground floors, making it a ghostly place, a residential ghetto \u2013 something that MBM sought to remedy in subsequent projects elsewhere. Mackay was an enthusiastic fan of the village, however, and had lived there with his family since the Olympics. In the past 20 years, MBM undertook various large urban regeneration projects, especially in locations by the sea, among them Rio de Janeiro, Amsterdam, Hastings, in Kent, Bexhill, in East Sussex, and Plymouth. Mackay wrote the report A Vision for Plymouth, and from 2003 to 2007 chaired the city\u2019s design panel. At times he expressed frustration with the British system, as public-private finance initiatives meant MBM lost control of its projects. Mackay published several well-received books, among them Modern Architecture in Barcelona (1985) and the autobiographical A Life in Cities (2009) and On Life and Architecture (2013). A kindly, reserved man, he had the gift of jargon-free writing and speaking. He flourished in recent years, giving several talks in the UK. He is survived by Roser, their four daughters and two sons, 13 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. \u2022 David John Mackay, architect and city designer, born 25 December 1933; died 12 November 2014", "sentences": ["In the past 20 years, MBM undertook various large urban regeneration projects, especially in locations by the sea, among them Rio de Janeiro, Amsterdam, Hastings, in Kent, Bexhill, in East Sussex, and Plymouth."], "title": "David Mackay obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/23/david-mackay", "tags": ["Architecture", "Catalonia", "Art and design", "Spain", "Amnesty International"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-25T13:30:02Z", "article": "Jacqueline Woodson was already the author of 28 children\u2019s books, most of them award-winning, when her Brown Girl Dreaming won the National Book Award for Young People\u2019s Literature last week. She is a three-time recipient of Newbery Honors, and she\u2019d been nominated for the NBA before. Her achievement, however, was swiftly eclipsed by coverage of the racist joke that Daniel Handler, aka Lemony Snicket, made after she got off the stage. In a phone interview with the Guardian she declined to comment on the firestorm, though she also said she will, eventually. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out how to think about it,\u201d she said. Such care is reflected in the way Woodson speaks: slowly and thoughtfully, and from a place of deep reflection about the culture she is in. Her books span many settings and situations, but they always express the experiences of young people of color. She is committed to making those stories visible, yet she writes her books within the frame of a very white industry. \u201cI feel like, as a person of color, I\u2019ve always been kind of doing the work against the tide,\u201d she said, though she is still optimistic. \u201cI feel like change is coming, and change sometimes comes too slow for a lot of us. But it comes.\u201d Woodson is 51 and lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with her partner and two children. She was born in Ohio, and lived there and in Greenville, South Carolina. When she was six, her single mother brought her brothers and sisters to live in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn. That early part of her life is what Brown Girl Dreaming tracks. In short lines of blank verse, it traces Woodson\u2019s life from birth to about the age of 10. The clean simplicity of Woodson\u2019s writing delivers beautiful and deep metaphors. A dying grandfather is comforted by young Jacqueline\u2019s stories, and she remarks: \u201cThis I can do \u2013 find him another place to be / when this world is choking him.\u201d The entire book is a love letter to the power of stories, in fact, though it doesn\u2019t overly sentimentalise how others react to storytelling. \u201cKeep making up stories, my uncle says,\u201d the narrator writes. \u201cYou\u2019re lying, my mother says.\u201d Woodson says she began writing the book when her mother died suddenly. She described the death as a \u201cwake-up call that the people I love, and the people who know my story, and the people who know my history are not always going to be here.\u201d Writing became a quest to make sure some kind of record existed. \u201cI just started writing down memories,\u201d she said, and gradually she came to realise there were holes in hers. Interviewing relatives, she said, allowed her to see her mother differently: \u201cThe strength of my mother is something I didn\u2019t pay attention to for so long. Here she was, this single mom, who was part of the Great Migration, who was part of a Jim Crow south, who said, \u2018I\u2019m getting my kids out of here. I\u2019m creating opportunities for these young people by any means necessary.\u2019\u201d There she hints at how entwined her own story is with the history of America. The book tracks young Jacqueline\u2019s experiences of racism in the deep south to her lessons, in a New York City school, about the divided history of the city: And all of New York was called New Amsterdam,run by a mannamed Peter Stuyvesant. There were slaves here.Those who could afford to owntheir freedomlived on the other side of the wall.And now that place is called Wall Street. For some, a book-length poem might look like a daunting read, but Brown Girl Dreaming glides down easily. And its subject matter clearly hits a nerve even if its form is unusual. Woodson said she\u2019d heard both \u201cfrom fourth-grade girls and from 70-year-old women\u201d who related to the book. In fact, one adult reader, Ashley Ford of Buzzfeed, has called the book \u201cthe realisation of a dream\u201d. Ford pointed out that one reason women of color flock to books like Woodson\u2019s is that their own childhood libraries were only sparsely populated with stories about people of color. \u201cI didn\u2019t know my absence until I saw myself,\u201d Woodson said on this subject. She read Judy Blume\u2019s Are You There God, It\u2019s Me Margaret? like everyone else. And she did find things in its protagonist to relate to, but it involved a search. \u201cI would have to find myself through those windows,\u201d Woodson said. \u201cBecause if not, then what did I have?\u201d But then she found Virginia Hamilton and John Steptoe, both writers of color. They wrote about city kids, and in their work she found \u201ca full body and a full story\u201d, Woodson said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I looked back and began to recognize the absence that had been there before.\u201d Woodson also lists James Baldwin and Rosa Guy as influences. \u201cThey were writing about young adults,\u201d she pointed out, and she read them when she was young herself. All these writers, she said, gave her a sense of her own \u201clegitimacy\u201d. \u201cThe longing [for those books] is in what\u2019s not said,\u201d she said, of her own fans. They write to her and tell her they love her books and that they\u2019ve never read anything like them, but the clear message is they want more of it. So to that end, Woodson is involved with an effort called We Need Diverse Books. The idea, she says, is to keep the call for diverse books from being \u201cjust a hashtag\u201d. She explains that the initiative has concrete plans to put diverse books in libraries and more importantly in publishing, by funding paid internships for example. After his racist gaffe, Handler contributed $110,000. And Woodson says what she always hoped to accomplish in her own work is to make books be a kind of companion for everyone. \u201cI want it to be there for the people who need it. I don\u2019t want anyone to walk through the world feeling invisible ever again,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in writing about all kinds of families, all kinds of people, writing across socioeconomic class and race, and gender and sexuality, you know it\u2019s hard not to come to a book and find some part of yourself in it. If the people who need it can find it then, I\u2019ve done what I needed to do.\u201d", "sentences": ["The book tracks young Jacqueline\u2019s experiences of racism in the deep south to her lessons, in a New York City school, about the divided history of the city: And all of New York was called New Amsterdam,run by a mannamed Peter Stuyvesant."], "title": "Jacqueline Woodson: 'I don't want anyone to feel invisible'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/25/jacqueline-woodson-national-book-awards-invisible", "tags": ["Books", "National Book Awards", "Awards and prizes", "Culture", "Children and teenagers"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-25T19:27:00Z", "article": "Sir Philip Green has brushed off a fall in annual profits at his his retail empire, which includes Topshop and Miss Selfridge, saying he could be \u201ca buyer or a seller\u201d of high street chains due to the strength of his group\u2019s balance sheet. Pretax profits for Taveta Investments, the group which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Burton and BHS, fell 3.4% to \u00a3189.3m in the year to 30 August despite a near 1% rise in sales to \u00a32.7bnas Bhs slid further into the red.

He is looking at putting grocery outlets in up to 80 of Bhs\u2019s stores in the next 12 to 18 months after he said trials in a handful of outlets had gone well. Asked if he would consider selling the chain, which has had a number of suitors of the years, Green said he was not marketing any of his brands. But he added: \u201cWe could be a buyer or a seller. As a company we are in good shape and have got all the flexibility we want to do what we want.\u201d Other parts of the group had a tricky year, with underlying sales up just 0.7% and profit margins down 0.3%, despite a strong performance at Dorothy Perkins and Wallis. But online sales rose 13.4% as Arcadia worked with 10 different international websites, including Germany\u2019s Zalando and China\u2019s Shangpin as well as selling via its own online stores.

This Sunday there are three more, but one has attracted more attention than most \u2013 because there are fears that if it wins majority support it could trigger a worldwide gold rush. Five million Swiss voters are to decide on a proposal that would force the central bank to triple its gold reserves. The vote is being watched closely by financial markets and governments around the world. Under the \u201cSave Our Swiss Gold\u201d initiative the Swiss National Bank (SNB) would be obliged to hold at least a fifth of its assets in gold within five years. The bank would be required to repatriate all Swiss gold held abroad and be banned from selling any of its holdings in future. A fifth of Switzerland\u2019s 1,040 tonnes of gold reserves are held with The Bank of England and nearly a third with the Canadian Central Bank. The organisers say they are motivated by wanting \u201csecurity and independence for Switzerland in times of uncertainty\u201d. They argue a policy change is necessary because attempts to constrain the strength of the Swiss franc to boost national exports have meant the SNB has too many euros at a time when that currency is losing value. The slogan for the initiative \u2013 which has gripped Switzerland and been displayed on posters showing hands holding a grinning piggy bank decorated with the Swiss flag \u2013 urges voters to \u201cprotect the people\u2019s wealth\u201d by voting yes. Its supporters come from the populist right-wing Swiss People\u2019s party (SVP), which says in its mission statement: \u201cMost Swiss don\u2019t even know that part of the nation\u2019s gold is stored abroad and that the SNB has already sold over half of the gold reserves.\u201d Switzerland, a country with a strong tradition of refining and trading gold, has the highest gold reserves per inhabitant of any country, equivalent to four ounces a head. For many this remains insufficient. If the Swiss vote yes on Monday, the SNB would be required to buy 1,500 tonnes of gold over the next five years, the equivalent of almost 70% of the global gold mined every year. Experts say the gold price would soar. \u201cIt would be an unforgettable day for the precious metal industry,\u201d according to German business analyst Michael Schr\u00f6der. Ahead of the vote the Swiss franc has risen to a two-year high. But support in the referendum has been waning as it draws nearer, with a poll a week ago suggesting only 38% were in favour, down from 42% last month. The debate has underlined the emotional and arguably romantic pull of the precious metal in an age where less tangible assets dominate. \u201cGold continues to trigger impetuous and irrational reactions in many people,\u201d Sergio Rossi, professor of macroeconomics and monetary economics at Fribourg University, told the Swiss news agency SDA. Others say it has rather emphasised the flaws in the monetary system. \u201cIt has shown just how unsustainable the debt-based monetary system we have is,\u201d said Koos Jansen, an Amsterdam-based gold analyst for the Singaporean precious-metal dealer BullionStar. \u201cThe Swiss initiative is merely part of a increasing global scramble towards gold and away from the endless printing of money. Huge movements of gold are going on right now. Recently the Dutch repatriated 122 tons, Germany is bringing home its gold from the US, whilst the Bric countries are accumulating large quantities of it for their banks. \u201cWhile those behind the Swiss initiative have often been portrayed as crazy, they\u2019re merely acting out of fear that their central bank is losing control of its monetary policy, and of the Swiss franc being sucked into this currency war and losing its value,\u201d he said. Switzerland left the gold standard only in 1999, the last country in the world to do so. \u201cThey regret what they did and want to get back to the safety of gold, especially in the current environment,\u201d Jansen added. The SNB chairman, Thomas Jordan, has warned of \u201cdangerous\u201d consequences if the vote goes through, arguing that if the bank were forced to boost its gold reserves, its costs would increase exponentially and its ability to move within the currency market would be severely hindered, putting its credibility at stake. \u201cThe initiative is dangerous because it would weaken the SNB,\u201d he told an audience near Zurich last week. \u201cThe connection between a minimum share and a ban on selling which it embraces would very severely impair our monetary policy room for manoeuvre.\u201d He added that the initiative was in danger of destabilising one of the SNB\u2019s main policies of not letting the euro weaken below 1.20 Swiss francs, which was introduced in an attempt to protect exporters as the Swiss currency gained strength against the troubled euro. Opponents of the initiative argue the bank would no longer be able to sell gold in the event of a crisis and so its gold reserves would no longer be considered a reserve in the traditional sense. But others say if Switzerland were to hold 20% of its assets in gold it would be better protected from the volatility of the currency markets. \u201cThe central bank would lose flexibility but long term it would bring the country more stability,\u201d said Jansen. Sunday\u2019s votes have also called into question Switzerland\u2019s status as one of the most business-friendly countries in the world.

The company said like for like sales in its retail business in the 17 weeks to 22 November had been hit by the unseasonally warm weather - not the first retailer to complain of that - and had fallen 5.7%. But margins improved, helped by a continued focus on full price sales. It closed three stores in the UK but opened two new concessions, and also expanded in Berlin, Amsterdam and Spain. Wholesale revenues - selling its products to retailers in 60 countries around the world - rose by 9%, and the spring 2015 order book was strong. The improvement in the wholesale division and in global licence income meant a strong reduction in losses for the period. So it repeated its guidance for the full year outcome. Chairman and chief executive Stephen Marks said:  As widely reported, trading in UK retail has been tough and while we still have the all-important Christmas period to come, I am pleased to report that the overall performance of the group continued to be positive, particularly in UK wholesale and global licensing with continued tight cost control, and we expect the results for the full year to be in line with market expectations.  French Connection has risen 5.5p to 56.5p, although the shares are fairly illiquid with Marks holding nearly 42%.     French Connection shares soar    Analyst Michael Campbell at Northland Capital said:  Despite UK retail impacted by milder weather, the improved wholesale and prudent cost control have helped offset the negative impact and this should be well received. Consensus has a loss of c. \u00a31.6m pencilled in for FY15 an improvement on the c. \u00a36.1m loss before tax in the prior year. Growth in UK/Retail sales would be a catalyst for the share price however the stock looks up to date with events with no reference to growth in this area in our view.  Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald also had a hold rating:  Following these results, we are, for the time being, retaining both our 2015 pre-tax forecast of break-even and our 2016 forecast of \u00a32.0m. The company\u2019s strategy, in our view, now has traction particularly in the UK and Europe. There is more clarity on pricing architecture between the \u2018good, better and best\u2019 ranges\u2019 particularly in womenswear. The accessories assortment has been strengthened, as there is a better focus on the \u2018best sellers\u2019 and there has rightly been a significant reduction in markdown activity. The company also has a number of valuable brands including Toast and Great Plains and has a relatively strong balance sheet with group cash forecast at \u00a330m at January 2015. However, UK/ Europe retail is still expected to be loss making. We are thus for the time being... reducing our target price to 65p from 80p.   But Numis issued a buy note:  We remain positive: In all, we leave our estimates unchanged, with an upgrade to our full year forecast for Wholesale offsetting the weather- affected retail outturn. Encouraged that numbers remain intact despite such a challenging trading period, we retain our positive stance, with clear benefits being seen from the sensible initiatives being implemented across the group.

It\u2019s 11am on the normally sombre walkway between Berlin\u2019s central station and the Brandenburg Gate, a route that is home to several dignified memorials commemorating the city\u2019s darkest days. But sombre is not on the agenda for the legions of Hamburger SV supporters who have descended on the German capital for this afternoon\u2019s encounter with Hertha Berlin. Almost everyone has a bottle of beer on the go. Several have two. We\u2019re barely past breakfast. But such prodigious intake carries no cause for alarm. German domestic football is renowned for its happy-go-lucky, celebratory atmosphere, where clashes between opposing fans are rare. German football is also applauded for its inexpensive admission prices. For instance, entry to a Bayern Munich home match \u2013 one of the top three teams in Europe, no less \u2013 can cost as little as \u20ac15. The cheapest ticket for one of Arsenal\u2019s top home games is more than \u00a365. In search of more affordable matches, I\u2019m taking my nine-year-old son Finn for a half-term short break to see how Europe does football. Our tickets, bought in advance from the club website to avoid disappointment on the day, are burning a hole in our pockets. Four days of father-son bonding, with lashings of football, trains and pizza. We\u2019re as excited as each other. As we\u2019ll be making good use of Berlin\u2019s excellent rail network for the next 24 hours, our base in the German capital is the smart yet comfortable Steigenberger Hotel Am Kanzleramt (doubles from \u20ac85), barely a goalkeeper\u2019s clearance from the city\u2019s Hauptbahnhof. The station is a fascinating destination in itself. It\u2019s like a scene from Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis, with trains of various sizes and colours crisscrossing the concourse on different levels. The match is a 20-minute ride across the city on the overground S-Bahn network, autumn\u2019s yellows and browns warming up the grey suburbs we see from the window. Hertha Berlin\u2019s home ground is the Olympiastadion, the venue for this season\u2019s Champions League final, and the crucible for the 1936 Olympics. I give Finn a rudimentary history lesson on the significance of that particular sporting event, a lecture that\u2019s helped by our seats being just along from where Hitler sat scowling as Jesse Owens collected his four gold medals. The Olympiastadion is still used for athletics, but the running track is now a strikingly modern blue in colour.     The Olympiastadion, during a Bundesliga game between Hertha Berlin and Borussia Dortmund in 2014. Photograph: City-Press via Getty Images    The track might separate crowd and pitch, but our view is faultless and, come kick-off, we\u2019re engrossed, especially Finn (\u201cmy heart is pounding,\u201d he tells me between mouthfuls of a hot pretzel the size of his face). Both sets of fans, almost 60,000 in total, are in full voice throughout, competing choirs doing battle using the weapon of song. Both sets of fans also appear to be keen advocates of mass pogo-ing \u2013 a way of showing devotion to their respective teams while also keeping out the biting Berlin chill. A sharply contested match is decided by three second-half goals for the home team. The Hamburg fans around us are far from despondent, though. Despite the result \u2013 and the amount of pre-match refreshment \u2013 there\u2019s little visible disgruntlement, no tense atmosphere ready to boil over. I don\u2019t see so much as a discarded beer can getting kicked in frustration. Then it\u2019s off for the second leg of our tour: Constant Vanden Stock Stadium in Brussels to catch Belgium\u2019s league-leaders, Anderlecht, in action. Finn and I have travelled west taking one of Europe\u2019s many sleeper trains: in our case, the 14-hour service that glides between Berlin and Paris. Last night, from the cosiness of our two-berth compartment, Finn watched the lights of eastern Germany flicker past our window. This morning, as he tucked into his complimentary breakfast of baguette, brioche and chocolate milk, his top-bunk view was of sunrise over the green fields of France. From Paris, another train takes us to Brussels by midday, where we press our noses up against the windows of the out-of-our-price-bracket designer shops of Avenue Louise, the city\u2019s upmarket retail district, before grabbing an hour or two of stamina-saving rest at our hotel. Just off Avenue Louise and a 20-minute walk from the Eurostar terminal, Hotel Zoom (doubles from \u20ac100) is a recently opened, photography themed boutique establishment that describes itself as \u201ccosy industrial\u201d. Finn is particularly intrigued by its huge collection of analogue cameras; to a nine-year-old\u2019s eyes, these are relics of a bygone era.     Finn meets the Hertha Berlin mascot. Photograph: Nige Tassell    If you\u2019re following a more relaxed itinerary than us, Brussels makes a perfect single-city destination for the UK-based football tourist. Closer to London by train than Manchester, it offers a host of cultural attractions with which to fill the weekend (see visitbrussels.be for more). Plus, you can get into an Anderlecht match for \u20ac25 (\u00a320); some non-league English teams charge almost that much every Saturday afternoon. This evening\u2019s visitors are bitter rivals Standard Li\u00e8ge but, as in Berlin, the pre-match mood is calm and fraternal. The stadium is in a residential neighbourhood and surrounded by several bars serving Anderlecht\u2019s fans, watering holes that you suspect do slow trade outside of match days, if they\u2019re open at all. Finn and I share a portion of frites and mayonnaise outside a bar called Le But (The Goal), before taking our seats in the main stand. The capacity may only be a quarter of that of Berlin\u2019s Olympiastadion, but a full house ensures the atmosphere is even more passionate. In a stadium reminiscent of QPR\u2019s tight Loftus Road ground, we\u2019re closer to the action too. Again, though, we\u2019re sitting with the losing supporters. Tonight Standard upset the form book, dishing out a 2-0 defeat to the top-of-the-table locals. It\u2019s deep sighs and disbelieving shrugs all around us. But Finn doesn\u2019t care who wins. He\u2019s more delighted that all five goals this weekend have been scored at the end of the stadium where we\u2019ve been sitting. I\u2019m just relieved that our 1,800-mile odyssey has avoided a pair of 0-0 draws. Next morning, arriving at Gare du Midi to take the Eurostar home, we make a pact to undertake a continental football pilgrimage every season. We\u2019re both hooked. But why wait another 12 months? I glance at the departures board. There\u2019s a train for Amsterdam in five minutes.

It ran for five days in February at a Los Angeles gallery. LaBeouf said that news of the incident \u201ctravelled through the line\u201d of people waiting, and reached LaBeouf\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cWhen she came in she asked for an explanation, and I couldn\u2019t speak, so we both sat with this unexplained trauma silently. It was painful.\u201d The piece was part of a wider series of performance art events by the actor, triggered by what he calls a \u201cgenuine existential crisis\u201d after he was accused of plagiarism when he lifted portions of a Daniel Clowes short story for a film he was working on. LaBeouf wrote streams of bizarre tweets, quoting notorious apologies from famous individuals, and hired a skywriting plane to etch an apology across the Los Angeles sky. He also wore a paper bag to the Berlin premiere of Lars Von Trier\u2019s film Nymphomaniac, and said he would be retiring from all public life.     Shia LaBeouf at the premiere for Nymphomaniac. Photograph: AP    In the Dazed interview, LaBeouf seems to regret some of these responses, saying: \u201cI am a deeply ironic, cynical person. I was raised on The Simpsons and South Park, it\u2019s my default setting... [our generation] want to change things, we want to have hope, we just don\u2019t know how or where to look.\u201d Of the assertion he would withdraw from public life, he explained: \u201cThe 80s and 90s fucked us; our culture became a product to be sold, and anyone in a tabloid is a product \u2013 an object. American culture is just about blowjobs and golf. I wanted to take back ownership. Fuck the money, that was never the impetus. I wanted purpose.\u201d His initial cynicism dissipated, and he began performance art in earnest \u2013 projects included writing #STARTCREATING with further skywriters, and running 144 laps around an Amsterdam museum. Following the Dazed email interview, his and journalist Aimee Cliff\u2019s face-to-face interview was conducted in silence, with each filming the other. In the emails he also skirts further controversy in a discussion of masculinity centred around his current second world war film Fury. \u201cEvery primitive culture has a puberty ceremony where children become men. Jews still have it, but it\u2019s all religious nostalgia,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the withholding of a puberty ceremony from young men in our society is a scheme which has been cunningly devised to make young men go to war.\u201d The actor is currently undergoing treatment for addiction, following his June arrest for disorderly conduct and harassment after he interrupted a performance of Cabaret with obscene language.", "sentences": ["I wanted purpose.\u201d His initial cynicism dissipated, and he began performance art in earnest \u2013 projects included writing #STARTCREATING with further skywriters, and running 144 laps around an Amsterdam museum."], "title": "Shia LaBeouf: I was raped during performance art project", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/28/shia-labeouf-raped-performance-art-project-dazed", "tags": ["Shia LaBeouf", "Film", "Fury", "Culture", "Rape and sexual assault"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-29T14:00:01Z", "article": "I grew a beard when I was 17 to cover some scars on my face, and I\u2019ve only shaved it twice: once for the army, and once when I was in Amsterdam, where beards were unusual. Children were following me around making sheep noises. At the age of seven I was evacuated from London to Essex, but came back in time for the Blitz and the Battle of Britain. Then at the age of 14 I went to art school. So my childhood was broken up into quite distinct parts. The humour in my work has been a mixed blessing. It\u2019s what I chose to do, using graphics and commercial art. To some purists it\u2019s offensive, but I\u2019m a serious painter, and I think within the art world my painting is respected. We weren\u2019t paid very much [\u00a3200] for Sgt Pepper, and when it took off I felt that the visual artist [Blake and his then-wife Jann Haworth co-designed the album cover] should have been rewarded like everyone was. But that\u2019s all in the past. It\u2019s gone. I saw Paul McCartney last night and we hugged; he\u2019s a friend. Now when people say it\u2019s the greatest cover of all time, I celebrate the fact. There\u2019s a perception that the 60s were all about drugs and free love. Well, maybe for some people. I\u2019ve never touched drugs. My 60s were about working hard and being a painter. There\u2019s a new atmosphere when I go out. I\u2019m being revered \u2013 people are saying: \u201cYou were more important than you were given credit for.\u201d At the Groucho Club the other day about six girls asked to kiss me on the cheek. I feel like I\u2019ve earned it. I am totally non-political. I have never voted. I know I am neglecting my responsibility and my right to vote, but I don\u2019t want to vote for any one party and then see them win or lose. I wish there was a better system. I\u2019m incredibly aware that I\u2019m in my last phase. There\u2019s a great interest in late periods at the moment, with Picasso and Matisse exhibitions this year. Usually critics decide what your late period is, but I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m in mine now. It gives me a licence to paint whatever I want. I\u2019ve shot myself in the foot a few times. When Charles Saatchi started out I vowed never to sell to him, because he was a dealer rather than a collector. That was probably not a wise decision. Fame is often chance. When I started out, the celebrity culture was just getting started. The war was a catalyst. Now people get famous for really silly things \u2013 a footballer can become remembered forever for a single kick. As a child I was pathologically shy. Later I would drink too much to overcome it \u2013 at one stage I probably had a bit of a problem, although I\u2019ve never been to AA or anything. I don\u2019t drink like that any more. I need new knees; I\u2019d be a liability if I got as drunk as I used to. Wherever I go there are men waiting with square plastic bags full of records for me to sign.

When the chancellor delivers his autumn statement this Wednesday, \u201cmore of the same\u201d cannot be an option. After a 40% reduction in funding during this parliament, our efficiency savings are coming to an end. Further reductions without radical reform will have a detrimental impact on people\u2019s quality of life and will lead to vital services being scaled back or lost altogether. Services such as libraries, leisure centres and road maintenance continue to buckle under the strain of cuts and the ever-rising cost of caring for our growing elderly population. Failure to address this will not only jeopardise other services, but will pass costs on to the NHS, which will have to pick up the pieces if we cannot protect adult social care or provide the services that keep people healthy. Last week, the Smith commission set out a better deal for Scotland, granting more control over funding and recognising the importance of devolving power down beyond Holyrood. It\u2019s England\u2019s turn now. There is compelling evidence that taking decisions closer to the people affected achieves better results and saves money. It is vital that the autumn statement sets out a new settlement for England, which puts powers beyond Westminster, and shares out tax and spending across the UK on a fair basis.

Having grown up in the 50s, I have always thought the notion that the period was irredeemably repressed, hidebound by convention and awash with bigotry an over-simplification, if only because of The Goon Show and the rise of skiffle, trad jazz and rock\u2019n\u2019roll, all of which meant a lot to me. I was thus pleased to see Rachel Cooke tentatively raise the question, \u201cIs it possible the 1950s were more tolerant?\u201d (Comment), based on the revival of Emlyn Williams\u2019s Accolade, a play from 1950. This play shows that there were always dissenting voices amid the allegedly stifling conformity. For example, my parents belonged to the Progressive League, a left-leaning libertarian body founded by HG Wells and others in the 1930s, which pressed for reform across an extraordinary range of issues, including homosexual law, penal reform, abortion law, sex education, abolition of capital punishment, opposition to \u201cracialism\u201d and the \u201ccolour bar\u201d, all things we take for granted now. My mother also regularly attended a PL \u201cman/woman relationship\u201d group, which addressed all sorts of sexual and emotional matters, often drawing on psychoanalytic thinking, all at variance with the common assumption that everyone was \u201cbuttoned up\u201d in the 50s. Giles Oakley  London SW14 Bridge is just a theme park Three cheers for Rowan Moore for exposing the vanity project that is the proposed garden bridge on London\u2019s South Bank (\u201cThis garden bridge is nothing but a wasteful blight on the Thames\u201d, Comment). This is a theme park in all but name and with none of the safeguards that such a proposal would normally require. If we really needed a garden bridge, it should be linked to Kew Gardens, which is suffering from massive government cuts and could benefit and support such an initiative. Paul Wheeler  London SE10 A case of mild and bitter Tory MP Damian Green hits the nail on the head when he states that 61% of Conservative voters are optimistic about the immediate future but it\u2019s only 19% for Ukip supporters (\u201cKeep calm and carry on: Tories must stick to their policies, not embrace Ukip\u201d, news commentary). The century-old Conservative coalition has been deconstructed: those who are complacently satisfied with their bonuses and the cut in top rate tax have stayed with the Mark I party, while the embittered losers who blame foreigners, ethnic minorities and gays for their plight have defected to the Mark II party.\u00a0 Christopher Clayton  Christleton, Cheshire Passport pandemonium Your article \u201cForeign Office condemned for failing Britons in need of help\u201d (News) reports widespread dissatisfaction with the abolition of consular services on which Britons abroad could previously call. It is a good illustration of the government\u2019s commitment to Europe that the large British population in Brussels, the EU\u2019s capital, can no longer obtain a passport on the spot. The removal of all but emergency services from Brussels has also brought retaliation. Because Indian citizens can no longer obtain UK visas in Belgium, the Indian embassy here now refuses to issue visas for India to UK passport-holders, obliging them to go to Paris or Amsterdam. I can imagine that such reprisals will proliferate, to the great inconvenience of British citizens already inconvenienced by their own government. Richard Condon  Brussels Scottish wildcats: genetic purity is not a credible aim We feel we must respond to Kevin McKenna\u2019s inaccurate and scaremongering piece about Scottish wildcats (Comment, last week). Inaccurate press coverage is causing confusion and sadly undermining public support which would otherwise go to Scottish wildcat conservation. The Scottish Wildcat Conservation action plan is backed by a broad partnership of organisations including the country\u2019s leading experts and practitioners. The steering group includes Scottish Natural Heritage, Cairngorms National Park Authority, National Museums Scotland, Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, Scottish Gamekeepers Association, The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies \u2013 Edinburgh University, National Trust for Scotland and the Scottish Wildlife Trust. SNH\u2019s work is subject to rigorous peer review, and our commissioned reports on Scottish wildcats have all been subject to independent and thorough scientific review. This includes the recently published evidence supporting selection of wildcat priority areas. We aren\u2019t aware of any scientific information which the Scottish Wildcat Association or Wildcat Haven have published that would challenge the work being taken forward by the partnership.\u00a0 SNH has consulted widely and taken the views of the broad conservation and land management community into account when agreeing the action plan. There are a minority of individuals, cited in Mr McKenna\u2019s article, who think attempting 100% genetic purity is what matters, whereas the balance of opinion among the 30 organisations signed up to the action plan is that this is not a credible aim. Domestic cats have been present in Scotland for more than 2,500 years. It\u2019s extremely likely that there will be some domestic cat DNA even in the wildcats in our most remote areas. We\u2019re not aware of any evidence produced by Wildcat Haven or anyone else which would support adopting a purity threshold that excluded wildcats with any level of domestic ancestry. At the other end of the debate, working closely with the partnership are renowned ecologists and naturalists who consider the genetic purity of individual cats is not the only consideration for effective conservation of this iconic species. As naturalist and author, Sir John Lister-Kaye OBE, states: \u201cThe consensus among those of us who have been active field naturalists in the Highlands for many years consider it most unlikely that we will find 100% pure wildcats anywhere. In that case we have to work with the best wildcat stock we have got, based on distinct wildcat appearance and a strong predominance of wildcat genes. The purist approach is much more likely to produce inbreeding problems \u2013 the last thing our remaining wildcats need.\u00a0 There has to be common sense from an ecological point of view.\u201d WJ (Ian) Ross, chairman  Scottish Natural Heritage Inverness", "sentences": ["Because Indian citizens can no longer obtain UK visas in Belgium, the Indian embassy here now refuses to issue visas for India to UK passport-holders, obliging them to go to Paris or Amsterdam."], "title": "Council leaders of all parties plead for no more cuts | Letters", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/nov/30/letters-council-leaders-across-spectrum-plead-no-more-cuts", "tags": ["UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-11-30T08:00:11Z", "article": "There comes a time in every man\u2019s life when he has to stand up and be counted. On Friday, that moment arrived for Simon Anholt, a 53-year-old political consultant who lives on the Norfolk coast. Anholt\u2019s stage was a TED conference in Amsterdam; he walked to the middle of it, and without undue fanfare, quietly launched a revolutionary political party.         Simon Anholt\u2019s TEDxAmsterdam speech, part 1    Talking to me in the week before that event, Anholt, an eminently rational man who converses in rounded paragraphs, was full of the spirited energy of the evangelist. One plan tumbled over the next. He sees his new party, like all would-be political iconoclasts, as a definitive answer to the single most pressing issue of our times. That issue is not the budget deficit, or the terror threat, or immigration, or schools. It is, he says, without hesitation, \u201cthe question of how the human race finally organises itself to work together\u201d. Anholt is the world\u2019s leading expert on \u201cnation-branding\u201d \u2013 a term that, for his sins, he coined in an academic paper he wrote in 1998. Since then he has travelled the planet \u2013 five times to the moon and back on BA alone \u2013 advising presidents and prime ministers in 53 countries from Austria to (tough call) Zimbabwe on how they might begin to change their national image. (Short answer: they probably can\u2019t, at least not quickly, and then only by behaving extremely well.) He has built his career in part as a formidable cruncher of data. In advance of launching his party he has, therefore, inevitably looked at the numbers. Making coffee in his kitchen, he tells me, with understated excitement, that at a conservative estimate his new party has a natural constituency of about 700 million people, one tenth of the planet\u2019s total population, scattered pretty uniformly across it. He calls these people, (his people!) \u201cnew cosmopolitans\u201d. New cosmopolitans are, Anholt suggests, true citizens of the globalised world. That is to say they are people who have lost faith in the insularities of the nation state, who are interested in innovative policies, not redundant ideologies (\u201cthey buy tracks, not albums\u201d he says), people who through social networks often feel they have more in common with a Facebook friend or blogger in Cape Town or Kathmandu than their next-door neighbours; people who, collectively, want to \u201cupgrade humanity\u2019s attitude to itself\u201d. If the idea of linking all these people together sounds a little ambitious, Anholt is unconcerned. \u201cThere is a tendency, particularly among journalists, to do a calculation which reads: \u2018simple plus ambitious means naive,\u2019\u201d he says, looking at me squarely. \u201cOccasionally, simple plus ambitious just means good.\u201d I suggest he sounds a little like a data-driven Russell Brand. I get the sense it\u2019s not precisely what he wants to hear.         Simon Anholt\u2019s TEDxAmsterdam speech, part 2    Anholt\u2019s party is called the Good Country Party. It has, so far, no logo or headquarters or manifesto beyond a website which will make its debut this weekend. It is based on a simple premise. Globalisation, the great shaping idea of our time, has so far, Anholt argues, been driven entirely by corporations and technology. Popular politics has failed to create super-national spaces or structures to balance and counter those forces, or find solutions to the problems they create. The Good Country Party will be, he hopes, the first such place. \u201cThere is,\u201d Anholt says, with certainty of the aphorist, \u201conly one global superpower these days: the public opinion of 7 billion people. The question is how to marshal that power. In my experience of dealing with governments they still, at heart, whatever they profess, pursue this 19th-century model of \u2018compete or die\u2019. It is ludicrous.\u201d When Anholt looked around to see who might lead a movement away from such narrowness of vision, who might create the first globalised super-party, he couldn\u2019t \u2013 cometh the hour! \u2013 honestly see anyone better qualified than himself.     Anholt with Given Lubinda, the former foreign minister of Zambia.    The boast \u2014 that he is well-placed to set this grand idea in motion \u2014 is not an idle one, though. On his sofa, he makes it with some tongue-in-cheek awareness of its potential for hubris. But he also sees his one-man United Nations as a natural progression from the work he has been doing for most of his adult life. The most visible part of this work has been a series of indexes that attempt to measure exactly what countries think of each other. In 2005 Anholt created the Nation Brands Index, an enormous annual global survey (which now has 200bn data points) that ranks 50 countries in order of how positively they are perceived by a representative sample of people on the planet. Earlier this year he launched the Good Country Index, which refined that question to ask which is the \u201cgoodest\u201d (not better or best) country in the world? Which nation, against a complex series of seven objective metrics, devised by Anholt, looks outward, fulfils its international obligations, innovates and spreads the most per capita positivity? (Ireland, since you ask). It was after the launch of that second \u201cgoodness\u201d index at another TEDx talk in Germany that Anholt started to develop the idea of his borderless party. His talk was a surprising viral hit. It reached 1m internet views more quickly than any other TEDx talk. And not only that: it prompted hundreds and then thousands of comments and tweets, which Anholt, nothing if not obsessive, devoted days to responding to, one by one. A few things became clear from those comments. First, that Americans, particularly young American men, were often \u201cincoherent with rage\u201d that their nation did not feature in the top 10 of goodness; and second that people \u2013 cosmopolitans \u2013 from all parts of the world thought it a tremendous start, but what next? \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to be too fixated on the index itself,\u201d Anholt says. \u201cI get dragged into long conversations about how I assembled the data and really it was a toe in the water to start a debate on how you make nations less selfish.\u201d The primary answer to that question in the first instance, he believes, the founding premise of the Good Country Party, is a culture change. \u201cThe habit I am trying to bring about,\u201d Anholt says, \u201cis a universal dual mandate, that says: \u2018In this global age, anybody who has any power or responsibility over any group of people has responsibility not only for them but also for all the other people on the planet\u2019. That might sound absurd but to a degree climate change has begun to teach us how to do that. If you go to your average meeting of Munich city council and they are talking about street lighting you would expect them to be referring constantly to the whole planet. What I am trying to do is to speed up the process whereby everyone speaks in those terms. It is not just energy and pollution, it is also poverty, it is also peace. In the way that we have learned not to have any conversation that might be even accidentally sexist or racist, so we need at every level of organisation, to be thinking globally, to be that instinctive.\u201d At the national level, he says, the role of the foreign minister becomes crucial. \u201cToday, even in smart countries, basically he is the guy \u2013 and it nearly always is a guy \u2013 whose job is to keep the foreigners at bay,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd foreigners in his eyes are basically either customers or enemies. It is still: how are we going to make money out of them or how are we going to kill them? The idea that they might actually be of equal importance with our own citizens, collaborators and co-humans remains very far away\u2026 \u201d It remains particularly far away, these days, I suggest, where we sit, facing Europe across the North Sea, a part of the country in which Ukip has lately rolled up its trousers, knotted a hankie on its head and planted its little union flag in the sand. It would be fair to say that Anholt is not a lover of the Farage tendency. \u201cNationalism is a disgusting, repellent trait. We can love our families, or our village, or even our city, because to love your home is natural. But to love your country is really just to love its army. It is as pathological as fundamentalist religion. I love my God to the extent I will kill for Him. I love my nation to the extent that I will kill for it. There is no difference.\u201d He warms to this theme in a manner you don\u2019t hear that often on the eastern margin of the nation. \u201cThe European Union is probably the noblest project that humanity has ever contrived. It is the first time in history that a bunch of grown-up nation states have had the wisdom and maturity to abandon some of their precious sovereignty for the greater good. The fact that we don\u2019t want to participate in it is a sickening lack of imagination. The idea that unilateralism can possibly bring about any benefit for us or for anybody else in the longer term is just extraordinary.\u201d Anholt has not voted in a domestic election for 20 years, he confesses. Why does he have no faith in national democracy bringing about change? \u201cThe reason I don\u2019t vote here is twofold,\u201d he says. \u201cFirstly I don\u2019t like the idea of being branded. The idea of describing yourself as leftwing or rightwing or liberal or communist seems to me preposterous in the world we live in. Our politicians argue over pointless irrelevances and then you pick up a newspaper and find the planet is melting, and people are starving and killing each other. That is the only politics that matters \u2013 how we organise ourselves as a species. The rest is technocratic detail. I don\u2019t want it mixed up with ideology and rabble-rousing by a bunch of overgrown schoolboys in parliament.\u201d As electoral turnouts prove, he is certainly not alone in that belief. He does not think that this trend shows us to be increasingly apolitical though, just that the current choices are irrelevant. \u201cPeople much younger than me in this country are even further away from the idea of being brought up in a defining class or with a particular ideology they must submit to,\u201d he says. \u201cThese citizens, mostly but not exclusively young, are very globally connected and they see what is going on in the world and that is the stuff that keeps them awake at night. Like me, the rest, party politics, 19th-century nationalism, leaves them cold.\u201d    The only politics that matters is how we organise ourselves as a species. The rest is technocratic detail    Those people can of course join Greenpeace and have some influence on climate change, or give money to Amnesty and make some difference for political prisoners, but it is, Anholt argues, too fragmented. \u201cFor the real single issue, about how we organise ourselves to determine the fate of the species, there is nothing. There needs to be a place those people can go where they look for solutions.\u201d You can see his logic. But how will the Good Country Party actually work? One of his ideas for the party is that every individual member creates \u201cmini-worlds. \u201cComing up with new ideas and solutions to problems is immensely difficult if people come from the same backgrounds,\u201d Anholt says. \u201cThat is why immigration creates thriving economies. Once you start getting five or six people together from different backgrounds, different ages, different nationalities, religions, whatever, then you find that your inspiration is generally much more interesting.\u201d Technology and globalisation put the tools of this mixing at everybody\u2019s fingertips. \u201cIn many people\u2019s social media groups there are maybe five or six people from very different backgrounds or countries,\u201d he suggests. \u201cI think people should start doing a deal with that group. Any time they are faced with a difficult challenge, they should promise to consult those five or six people about it. Create a mini-world and brainstorm.\u201d In part, the Good Country Party would be an aggregator of such brainstorming; Anholt describes it, in his admittedly still forming plans, as the \u201cWikipedia for policy\u201d. To begin with though, it will loosely be an institute, the Anholt Institute in Copenhagen (with seed funding from the Danish government), which will, among other things, keep the Good Country Index data live, and a website that will share the data Anholt has collected and videos he has made. It will not ask for anything \u2013 money, or signatures \u2013 it will \u201conly give\u201d. \u201cQuickly it will become an exchange,\u201d he says with impressive certainty. \u201cAt the most basic level I am trying to introduce that cosmopolitan cohort to each other, because there has to be one place where they all meet. The Good Country Party is really a hymn in praise of what the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins called \u2018dapple\u2019. Mixing up shit makes things work.\u201d Anholt\u2019s own background is an example of that dapple. He grew up in The Hague until he was five and then in rural Surrey. His mother was an academic, a literary critic. His father was European market research director for an American company, and trilingual (his German was so good that during the war his work for British military intelligence included impersonating Nazi officers in Germany, a fact he only told his son when he was close to death). His mother at one stage worked for the British Council in Sweden, so she spoke that language and Finnish. They both spoke good French and Italian. \u201cI was always surrounded by chattering in different tongues,\u201d Anholt recalls. \u201cI grew up believing that foreigners might be more interesting than the people where I was growing up.\u201d He went to boarding school and Oxford where he studied languages and anthropology. He did a year in Italy, felt more at home there than here, went back after graduating and married an Italian with whom he has three grown-up children. After university he took a job in advertising, \u201cmainly because my father told me not to\u201d. He became international creative co-ordinator for the global agency McCann Erickson, and they sent him around the planet trying to figure out whether they were doing global campaigns properly. They weren\u2019t \u2013 because mostly what they were doing was just translating them from the English. Anholt left and started a company called World Writers, which instead of translating advertising campaigns into other languages, used native-language copywriters to culturally adapt them. He ran that business for 14 years and at the time he sold it in 2000, it had 45 people from 39 countries in an office in Soho. \u201cTranslation and mistranslation is how creativity starts,\u201d he says. By this time he had written his paper for the Journal of Brand management called \u201cNation Brands of the 21st Century\u201d \u2014 and created something of a monster. \u201cAll I really meant was: countries have images, and in the age of globalisation your country can sell more products and exchange more culture if you have a positive image,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you have a weak national image everything is difficult for you, everything is expensive. It was quite unfortunate because I picked the wrong term for it. Branding implied something you could spin.\u201d Ad agencies and PR people saw it as an opportunity to sell their services to governments and provide a short cut to greater international standing. \u201cThey approached countries as you might approach rebranding Toilet Duck,\u201d Anholt says. Cool Britannia comes to mind. Sometimes the governments called for Anholt himself. Wasn\u2019t he being brought in under false pretences? \u201cI often was,\u201d he says. \u201cI would disabuse them of the idea they had only an \u2018image problem\u2019 in the first meeting. The last thing you should do if you are concerned about your reputation is to obsess about your reputation. You have to figure out what you have been doing wrong and put it right. Reputation is reality with delay.\u201d The thing about the image of nations in people\u2019s minds, the data shows, is that people don\u2019t think about most other countries that often, and when they do they don\u2019t easily change their settled view. Most people don\u2019t go to bed at night reassessing their idea of Finland. \u201cWhat we do is ignore information that contradicts our view of a country until it becomes too insistent; government propaganda is never going to change international opinion,\u201d he says. \u201cImages of South Africa really did change because of Nelson Mandela and the end of apartheid. Or, for example, this year Germany is No 1 in the Nation Brands Index; it is the most admired country on earth. Seventy years is pretty quick to go from the bottom to the top. It started with the reliable products, then the political stability, the Europeanness. And then gradually the tourism and culture\u2026 The only thing that changes your national reputation is if you do real things to make the world more glad that you exist.\u201d Since the millennium year Anholt has delivered this message directly to the presidents \u2013 \u201cI always deal with the boss\u201d \u2013 in projects that have extended for months and years: \u201cMexico, Finland, Chile, Latvia, Austria, Greece, South Korea\u2026\u201d he could go on.     Anholt with Prince Alexander and Princess Katherine of Serbia.    After a decade of doing this strange work, in 2012 he found himself sitting down and taking stock. One of his most proactive relationships, trying over a period of years to help Felipe Calder\u00f3n, then president of Mexico, create policy \u2013 international leadership on climate change, for example \u2014 to counter the overwhelming negative news of drug wars, had come to an end. Looking at what he had achieved, Anholt had to conclude that, despite his efforts to make national governments more collaborative, in the end, \u201cone way or another, what I was doing was helping these countries to shaft each other. To be competitive.\u201d He took a year off. And in that year began digging down into his personal data mine. \u201cI was asking it a simple question,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat makes people like one country more than another?\u201d He produced something he called the MARSS model; MARSS stands for Morality, Aesthetics, Relevance, Sophistication and Strength, the \u201cfive drivers of national reputation\u201d. And when he examined the data he discovered \u2014 to his surprise, really \u2013 that of those five, by far the most significant one was the first: morality. \u201cI am not a cynic but I expected that people might admire Germany more than Poland, say, because Germany had more wealth,\u201d he suggests, \u201cor had a more beautiful landscape. Turns out that the most significant driver is: is this country a force for good? And when you think about it that is really motivated by self-interest. We admire countries that we don\u2019t have to worry about.\u201d Having made this discovery Anholt realised he could not go back to what he had been doing. \u201cIt was not enough for me to be telling governments to \u2018be good\u2019 privately. They needed their populations to tell it to them publicly. We need crowds demanding that they live in a good country, a country that fulfils its obligations. We needed people with the confidence that they were not alone in demanding that.\u201d Hence: the Good Country Party. Does he have any qualms about setting himself up as its architect? \u201cI\u2019m a little bit nervous about it,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a bit of experience of exposure. When the Nations Brand Index has discovered some controversial facts, for example that the country that is preferred by all Muslims across the world by a huge margin is the United States, I have got a lot of hate mail. Or when we included Israel for the first time and it ranked lower than Iran I was accused and threatened on the same day of being both a Zionist and an anti-Zionist. So I know how it might feel.\u201d He seems to believe that if he does not try this no one else will. \u201cI think there is a place for something positive,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the Occupy movement \u2013 experience teaches us that people don\u2019t like to be in angry or outraged places for a long time. They want the means to work toward a solution.\u201d He is nothing if not an idealist (as I talk to him I find that line from Imagine, \u201cYou may say I\u2019m a dreamer, but I\u2019m not the only one\u2026 \u201d looping in my head). How does he see the next few months shaping up? \u201cWell,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201conce we have the 700 million the question will be: \u2018How do I keep them entertained?\u2019 It\u2019s like sending out a Facebook invitation and finding 2,000 people on your lawn. You need some snacks to offer them. And there will be a crunch point about money at some point quite soon.\u201d At the moment, beyond the seed money from Denmark, Anholt is providing the finance himself (\u201cI\u2019m mortgaged to the hilt for this\u201d he says brightly). He is talking to one or two philanthropic organisations; he half imagines NGOs might want to pay a small stipend once he is up and running; but for the time being \u201cpeople find it hard to believe in something before it exists\u201d. Build it and they will come. But what if only 700 people turn up? He laughs at the very idea. \u201cWell that just means changing the world might take a bit longer,\u201d he says. goodcountry.org", "sentences": ["Anholt\u2019s stage was a TED conference in Amsterdam; he walked to the middle of it, and without undue fanfare, quietly launched a revolutionary political party.", "Simon Anholt\u2019s TEDxAmsterdam speech, part 1    Talking to me in the week before that event, Anholt, an eminently rational man who converses in rounded paragraphs, was full of the spirited energy of the evangelist.", "Simon Anholt\u2019s TEDxAmsterdam speech, part 2    Anholt\u2019s party is called the Good Country Party."], "title": "Simon Anholt interview: \u2018There is only one global superpower: public opinion\u2019", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/30/simon-anholt-good-country-party-global-superpower-public-opinion", "tags": ["Politics", "Globalisation", "Ethics", "World news", "UK news", "TED", "Internet", "Technology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-01T07:01:05Z", "article": "Jessie Burton, whose debut novel The Miniaturist was named Waterstones book of the year on Monday, has spoken of her frustration that \u201cstrong women\u201d are still considered a novelty in fiction.

Very few male novelists get asked: \u2018You\u2019ve put some really strong males in your book, why is that?\u2019 Or: \u2018You\u2019ve got a lot of men in your book\u2019.\u201d Set in 1688, the protagonist of The Miniaturist is 18-year-old Nella Oortman, a country girl who marries Johannes Brandt, a wealthy Dutch merchant trader twice her age. The story revolves around a miniature replica of their cloistered, controlled home given to Nella as a wedding gift. The idea came to Burton in 2009 when she was inspired by an intricate doll\u2019s house that sits in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. As well as Nella, oOther female characters that sit at the heart of the story include her sister-in-law Marin, her servant Cordelia and the illusive miniaturist herself. \u201cFor me, it was natural to create these women, all of whom are different and none of whom are perfect but who are also capable of great kindness and bravery and love,\u201d said Burton. \u201cEvery time I put pen to paper, a woman comes out.\u201d She said that much of the contention she had encountered with The Miniaturist centred on the supposedly inauthentic concept of having several strong females in a book set in a time when a woman\u2019s realm was almost entirely domestic. It was an allegation, said Burton, that she really took issue with. \u201cIt\u2019s been one of the biggest debates around the book, is it too contemporary?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the world is suddenly full of 17th century experts about what women may or may not have thought. My research had shown that women at the time had a mobility, certainly rich women, that they would not have had 100 years previously \u2013 women would often take over their dead husband\u2019s businesses and could even join certain guilds. It was something I wanted to explore.\u201d Even though Burton once herself referred to the The Miniaturist as \u201cgolden age feminist fiction\u201d, she said she looked forward to the day when \u201cthe book is not defined by that, just because there are lots of female protagonists.\u201d \u201cI certainly don\u2019t take issue with it being called a feminist book,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a long way to go for equal representation for women in business and in the media and the debate has to keep going. And while some people say it\u2019s a loaded term, I don\u2019t think it has frightened off any male readers I know. In fact I\u2019ve had quite a few men getting in touch to tell me how much they\u2019ve loved the book, people I would never have expected to pick it up.\u201d Burton, 30, was an actress before she turned to writing, and wrote most of The Miniaturist whilst balancing her sporadic appearances on stage and various temping jobs in the City. Much of the book was penned in what she called a slow and often laborious process over three years, typing up a few paragraphs on the commute to work, reading 17th-century Dutch recipe books on her weekends, and secretly redrafting chapters while working as a PA. It was an exhausting gamble that paid off. The Miniaturist earned Burton an impressive six-figure advance after 11 publishers desperately bid for her book and it went straight to the top of the bestseller lists the fastest-selling debut since EL James\u2019s Fifty Shades of Grey. The author has already begun work on her second novel, titled Belonging, which is set between 1930s Spanish Civil War and the London art scene of the 1960s. It tells the story of a promising artist who goes missing in battle in 1937 and whose works re-emerge on the London art market 30 years later. Yet despite the global success of The Miniatures, Burton said throwing herself fully into another book was a deeply daunting prospect, a view she also voiced on a recent blogpost on her website. \u201cEvery time I write a sentence, tiny weights seem to latch, slipping over words like lumpen clogs across the page, ungainly, worrisome,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNothing is good enough. It will never be good enough. It is completely terrifying.\u201d", "sentences": ["Burton\u2019s delicately woven tale of 17th-century Amsterdam is one of the most successful novels of the year.", "The idea came to Burton in 2009 when she was inspired by an intricate doll\u2019s house that sits in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam."], "title": "Jessie Burton frustrated \u2018strong women\u2019 still considered a novelty in fiction", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/01/jessie-burton-frustrated-strong-women-still-considered-novelty-fiction", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "UK news", "Waterstones", "Booksellers"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-01T11:25:43Z", "article": "Four leading UK entrepreneurs have called for better travel links to help expand the technology cluster beyond London to the \u201cgolden triangle\u201d between Cambridge, Oxford and the capital. A report commissioned by the Cambridge-based entrepreneurs, which includes the UK semiconductor industry founder Hermann Hauser, angel investor Sherry Coutu, biotechnology head Andy Richards and telecoms businessman David Cleevely, claims that poor infrastructure connecting the south-east region is holding Boris Johnson\u2019s golden triangle vision back. \u201cDrawing lines between places on a map does not make them connected,\u201d said Cleevely. \u201cWe need to connect people and ideas and back this with infrastructure to match.\u201d  \u2018Exist in relative isolation\u2019 Having twice as many technology startups per head than any other city in the EU makes Cambridge Europe\u2019s leading technology cluster, according to the report. However, current connectivity inhibits Britain from competing with Silicon Valley or Shanghai. \u201cUnlike their counterparts in Silicon Valley, Cambridge, Oxford, London, and their neighbours exist in relative isolation,\u201d wrote the authors, who said that it was easier to work with people in Manchester, Amsterdam or Paris than between cities in the south east.  \u201cAs well as connecting people and ideas within a single city, we need to be thinking about connecting nearby cities with a modern and effective infrastructure,\u201d they said. \u201cWe do not have the concentration of humming, continuous, multidirectional, and mutually reinforcing corridors of innovation, spilling-over with people, ideas, investors and promise. That is what it would look like if the fabled \u2018golden triangle\u2019 were a reality,\u201d The report points to King\u2019s Cross as a suitable rail \u201cmega-hub\u201d connecting London, Oxford, Cambridge and the surrounding areas including Stevenage, Stansted, Milton Keynes, the Thames Valley and Martlesham. \u2018Integrated scale of Silicon Valley\u2019 More people, 744,000, according to recent research by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, are employed in the technology industry in the golden triangle than work in Silicon Valley. Foreign investors see London, Oxford and Cambridge as broadly the same area. \u201cGreater integration across the south east to achieve the integrated scale of Silicon Valley would spur the economy and accelerate inward investment into the UK,\u201d the authors state. But to do that the authors insist that transport links must be enhanced to ensure travel time between the south east, Oxford and Cambridge is reduced to less than 40 minutes within 10 years. Current travel times can be between two and three hours, which prevents the chance encounters that foster innovation within clusters. In the short term, the authors suggest that more hubs, like Google\u2019s Campus in London, which provides space and expertise for startups to get a foothold, are needed to provide a safe place for companies to take risks on projects and innovation. They also provide space for developing ideas through informal meetings, the kind of innovation that isn\u2019t found in the boardroom, according to the authors. \u201cHubs don\u2019t need to be in fixed places; let\u2019s have special carriages on trains designated as informal meeting places, and start with Oxford-London and Cambridge-London,\u201d the authors said. Technology in the form of giant interactive screens could also aid informal mingling. \u201cWalking past such a screen, you might see someone you know (and had been meaning to have a chat with). You attract their attention \u2013 wave and say hello,\u201d the authors speculate. \u201cThe system should then allow you to talk as if you had met in the street or cafe, and to transfer that conversation seamlessly to your own smartphone or tablet.\u201d \u2022 British government urged to support \u2018scale-ups\u2019 not just startups", "sentences": ["\u201cUnlike their counterparts in Silicon Valley, Cambridge, Oxford, London, and their neighbours exist in relative isolation,\u201d wrote the authors, who said that it was easier to work with people in Manchester, Amsterdam or Paris than between cities in the south east."], "title": "Poor travel links 'stop UK tech competing with Silicon Valley'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/01/poor-travel-links-stop-uk-tech-silicon-valley", "tags": ["Technology startups", "Technology", "Technology sector", "London", "Oxford", "Internet", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-02T18:52:37Z", "article": "If the words of Martin Luther King have always encapsulated an era of great struggle and change, the same is true of the images. In sepia tones, we see him at the front of the march in Montgomery, Alabama, where the bus boycott by African Americans claimed world attention. We see him at the Lincoln Memorial, sharing his dream with millions around the globe. We see him on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, next to Jesse Jackson, hours before the assassination. Jackson smiles, King oblivious to what was to happen, nevertheless looks pensive. Much less familiar, but undoubtedly potent and closer to home, is the image being celebrated in London on Thursday 4 December of King in the capital. Fifty years ago, on 6 December, as he travelled from the US to Oslo to collect the 1964 Nobel peace prize for his leadership of the civil rights movement, King broke his trip to preach a scholarly sermon in front of a 3,000-strong congregation at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. His evensong address, The Three Dimensions of a Complete Life, is not one of the speeches best known by the wider public, but it underpinned his theological career. It was the sermon he first preached as his trial address at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery in 1954. He subsequently gave versions of that sermon every year until his assassination in 1968. St Paul\u2019s, grand and imposing, seemed an unlikely stopping point for a man of establishment-shaking politics, but it was the perfect London platform for King\u2019s sermon. The cathedral had long before thrown its weight behind the fight against racism with the recruitment of the radical Anglican priest John Collins to the cathedral chapter in 1948. Collins, a co-founder of War on Want and CND and very much the internationalist, was heavily involved in South Africa\u2019s anti-apartheid movement and the support network for the King-led civil rights movement. Dogged, brave and resourceful, Collins \u2013 like King \u2013 saw his role as extending far beyond theology and the pulpit. Eight years earlier, he had run a campaign to raise funds to help anti-apartheid activists in South Africa \u2013 including Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu \u2013 fight treason charges. He arranged for the African-American superstar and activist Paul Robeson to sing spirituals in the cathedral, but fundraising was only part of the achievement. The key was smuggling \u00a3100,000 into the apartheid state with its hugely oppressive security infrastructure. Collins was very much the point man for radical activists. After Dr King\u2019s death, Collins organised the visit by Dr King\u2019s widow, Coretta Scott King, who became the first woman to preach in the cathedral.     In the pulpit \u2026 Martin Luther King at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, London, 6 December 1964. Photograph: Terry Disney/Getty Images    But on that crisp Sunday in 1964, with all seats taken and hundreds standing, it was King himself centre stage. Official pictures show him in the pulpit, having negotiated the curved wooden staircase in his severe black robe. This was the other Dr King, the teacher and lecturer; studious, deliberate. \u201cAt times his voice was a slow, soft southern drawl,\u201d said the Times. \u201cThen the tempo would increase and the words would come tumbling out in a flood of oratory. Quotations rolled off his tongue. He was actor, poet and preacher all at the same time.\u201d King took his theme from the Book of Revelation and John\u2019s description therein of the dimensions of a city: \u201cThe length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.\u201d This was symbolism, said King. \u201cHe\u2019s saying at bottom that life as it should be and life at its best is a life that is complete on all sides.\u201d At his conclusion \u2013 after a weave of quotations and homilies described by the Times as \u201cspellbinding\u201d, he said of the Three Dimensions: \u201cWhen you get all three of these together, you can walk and never get weary. You can look up and see the morning stars singing together, and the sons of God shouting for joy.\u201d \u201cWe must not seek to rise from a position of disadvantage to one of advantage, substituting injustice of one type for that of another,\u201d he told the congregation. \u201cGod is not interested in the freedom of white, black or yellow men, but in the freedom of the whole human race.\u201d Theological duties complete, he descended the staircase to give a press conference in the St Paul\u2019s chapter house. Wearing a smart suit, this was King the passionate activist, emphasising the common social traits between the struggle he knew best in the US and the situation here. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fact now, and everybody knows it, that there are growing racial problems in Britain as a result of the large number of coloured persons from the West Indies, from Pakistan and India who are coming into the country,\u201d he told ITN. \u201cAnd it is my feeling that if Britain is not eternally vigilant and if England does not, in a real sense, go all out to deal with this problem now, it can mushroom and become as serious as the problem we face in some other nations.\u201d He spoke of the iniquity of immigration laws based on colour, condemning the practice \u2013 according to the Times \u2013 as totally contrary to \u201cthe laws of God and with the trends of the 20th century\u201d. Left unchecked, he said, such failings would \u201cencourage the vestiges of racism and endanger all the great democratic principles which this country held dear\u201d. The parallels were there to be drawn with the US, he said. Attention needed to be paid to education, housing and employment in the UK, \u201cif the nation was to prosper in spirit and in truth\u201d. His tone was stark. \u201cMorality cannot be legislated, but behaviour can be regulated. The law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him lynching me, and that is quite important.\u201d The Times was entranced by the pulpit rhetoric, but also conveyed the tough message delivered subsequently. \u201cDr King\u2019s racial warning to Britain,\u201d its headline said. Watching King that day, Canon Collins\u2019s wife, Diana, saw a complex figure. \u201cHe gives the impression of a deeply solitary person, a man who has wrestled with God \u2026 he came to London from a sick bed and was clearly exhausted. But the feeling of his inner strength remains with one; he moves through the crowds, through both execration and exclamation, his eyes fixed on a distant goal.\u201d If he was exhausted, this couldn\u2019t be allowed to impede his schedule. King made headlines again the next day, when he travelled to the City Temple hall in central London, where his message was broader in scope, touching on racism in apartheid South Africa, as well as Britain. That he spoke with authority was not the result of a rushed briefing about the state of race relations in the UK. King \u2013 always conscious of how international opinion affected his struggle in the US \u2013 sought to keep abreast of the shape and progress of battles elsewhere. In 1957, on his way back to the US from Ghana, he travelled through Nigeria, Rome, Geneva and Paris and stopped in London, where he had lunch with social theorist CLR James. The event is recorded in Frank Rosengarten\u2019s biography of James, Urbane Revolutionary. \u201cA high point in James\u2019s life in relation to his belief in the capacity of ordinary people to be agents of their own liberation was a five-hour conversation that he, together with his wife, Selma James, and the novelist George Lamming had at the Jameses\u2019 home on the afternoon of 24 March 1957, with Martin Luther King and his wife, Coretta Scott King,\u201d writes Rosengarten. \u201cKing\u2019s description of his experiences during the year-long Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56 made a powerful impression on James.\u201d Now 84, and still steeped in activist campaigns, Selma James well recalls the marathon lunch. She served fish. King was famous then, she says, but not yet entirely comfortable with the limelight his activism had attracted. \u201cHe was extremely modest in 1957. The story of his work was told by Coretta, not him. He just listened for long periods and bowed his head. He was quiet. You could see that he could be angry, but he kept it in check.\u201d She saw him again in London in 1965, at a Hilton hotel meeting of UK activists to discuss setting up an anti-discrimination campaign body. \u201cThen he was the maestro. He was definitely in charge. He was not in any way arrogant, but he was chair and didn\u2019t seem anything like the novice he had been.\u201d     Martin Luther King, on right, with fellow civil rights activist Ralph Abernathy, in a London park, September 1964. Photograph: Bentley Archive/Popperfoto/Getty Images    It took King a while to grasp the complexities of discrimination in the UK as compared with the US. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he immediately understood what it meant that the victims of discrimination here were immigrants,\u201d says Selma. \u201cIn the US, you cannot say black people are not American, but here people did question the Britishness of black people. There were questions about the extent to which the UK was like the US, but it was different because we didn\u2019t have the whole weight of slavery and lynching. But there was the common thread of persecution and how to confront it.\u201d While British activists took from him experience and encouragement to mobilise, King saw in the UK how victims of discrimination from many ethnicities suffered jointly but could also work together; a scenario more complicated than the black/white fissures in the US. One direct result of his advocacy here was the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination, a body formed by activists including CLR James and Anthony Lester, now the Lib Dem peer Lord Lester of Herne Hill. It launched in 1964 and lasted three years. The government\u2019s own Commission for Racial Equality was created 12 years later. With race relations a sensitive issue for government in the 1950s and 60s, King might have been seen by the British establishment as a troublesome agitator, but for the most part he was not. Selma James believes his status as a churchman and advocate for peaceful protest shielded him, as did public sympathy here for the US civil rights movement. It meant the UK was an amenable platform for King. During a four-day visit in 1961, he recorded a landmark edition of the BBC interview programme Face to Face, a wide-ranging encounter with the celebrated interrogator John Freeman. Indeed, his St Paul\u2019s address was actually the highlight of two trips to the UK in 1964. He also visited in the autumn; a detour from his attendance at the European Baptist Federation conference in Amsterdam.     King signs the degree roll at Newcastle University after receiving his honorary doctorate in civil law, November 1967. Photograph: Express Newspapers/Getty Images    Five months before his assassination in April 1968, King headed to the north of England \u2013 to Newcastle upon Tyne to receive an honorary doctorate in civil law. The Duke of Northumberland \u2013 then vice chancellor \u2013 officiated as King received the only honour he would receive from a UK university in his lifetime. Accepting the award, King was as clear as he had been three years earlier at St Paul\u2019s \u2013 that the racism he sought to confront blighted societies and crossed borders. \u201cWhether it exists in the United States of America, whether it exists in England, or whether it exists in South Africa, wherever it is alive it must be defeated,\u201d he said. \u201cSomewhere along the way, in this sometimes sick and often terribly schizophrenic world, we have got to come to see that the destiny of white and coloured persons is tied together.\u201d \u2022 Additional research: Katy Stoddard.

Only Facebook was valued higher as a private company \u2013 $50bn \u2013 by investors when it raised money ahead of floating on Nasdaq. The social network is now valued at almost $210bn. Uber is not expected to become a public company for at least another 12 months. Travis Kalanick, its co-founder and chief executive, said the new funding would allow the company to expand, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. He said in a blog post that Uber is now six times larger than it was 12 months ago, operating in more than 250 cities in 50 countries. However, Kalanick admitted that the pace of expansion experienced by the company had resulted in \u201csignificant growing pains\u201d. He added: \u201cThe events of the recent weeks have shown us that we also need to invest in internal growth and change. Acknowledging mistakes and learning from them are the first steps.\u201d Uber has had to fight fires on a number of fronts this year, including negative stories about its corporate culture and the alleged behaviour of some of its drivers. One driver was charged in San Francisco with assaulting a customer in June. It has also had to deal with attempts to limit its operations in a number of cities. Last month the company apologised after a senior executive suggested the company hire a team of researchers to dig up dirt on hostile journalists. The apology came in the same week that Al Franken, the television comedian turned Democrat senator and chairman of the Senate sub-committee on privacy, wrote to Kalanick asking Uber to explain how it dealt with users\u2019 data. Its employees are able to track customers because its smartphone app relies on GPS technology to connect users with drivers. \u201cThe reports suggest a troubling disregard for customers\u2019 privacy, including the need to protect their sensitive geolocation data,\u201d Franken wrote. \u201cUnder what circumstances would an employee face discipline for a violation of Uber\u2019s privacy policies?\u201d He gave Uber 28 days to respond to his questions. The company said it would do so and had instructed law firm Hogan Lovells to review its data privacy rules. The San Francisco-based firm also said on Thursday that it had set up a software development team in Amsterdam, its international headquarters. Conrad Whelan, Uber\u2019s second employee and first engineer, said he had begun working with a team of 10 Dutch mobile software experts and hoped to expand that number to as many as 40 in the coming year.

Van Gaal did confirm that Wayne Rooney is fit to face the Saints. Van Gaal had a dispute with Koeman in 2004 when the latter was in charge at Ajax and he was the technical director. This led to Van Gaal leaving the Amsterdam club. He would not be drawn on Koeman, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t have to describe my relationship with the trainer of the opponent. That\u2019s more private, I think. We play against Southampton and we have to speak about Southampton and not the trainer-coach.\u201d Van Gaal bristled when it was suggested Koeman\u2019s achievement in taking Saints to third is more impressive because the club did not have United\u2019s financial muscle in the summer after losing several key players at that time. \u201cI have heard that in the media. Do we know how many players we lost?\u201d said the 63-year-old. \u201cI have never read that. We have lost more players but Ronald Koeman is a very good coach and I know that he can do it. \u201cIt\u2019s always surprising that a club like Southampton is in that position now but that\u2019s always a matter of coach, players and staff and when you do that it\u2019s very good. I don\u2019t think money is the question in this. When Manchester is coming clubs are always asking more money and we have to pay because we are Manchester United. \u201cDo you think Southampton pay too much for players? I don\u2019t think so, because they are Southampton. There is always a relationship between Real Madrid and Manchester United and teams like Aston Villa and Southampton.\u201d However, Van Gaal suggested that Southampton are also a surprise package that all leagues can have at the start of a campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s the same in every country. Every country always has at the beginning of the season a surprise. Zwolle \u2013 a club in the Netherlands \u2013 was leading the competition in the Dutch league for six or eight matches. It\u2019s always like that. \u201cBut as I have said earlier, what always matters is the end of May. That counts. Now it\u2019s not so important.\u201d Van Gaal then claimed some of the opposition could have been at Old Trafford by now, in addition to the \u00a328m summer signing Luke Shaw. \u201cThey have a very good squad. I know a lot of players and a lot of players were offered to us.\u201d Liverpool travel to Old Trafford six days after Monday\u2019s match but Van Gaal said: \u201cI believe I am always occupied with the first match and that\u2019s Southampton. Southampton play better at this moment. They have more points than Liverpool so I think the sequence is good that we have to play Southampton now.\u201d Van Gaal confirmed Rooney can start at Southampton and said Jonny Evans is set to return after an ankle injury. \u201cThe news is very good [about Rooney], he shall play. Evans is coming back. He is fit to play. [Phil] Jones is coming back but not fit to play. He needs training sessions and maybe also matches in the second team. But he is coming back. He is fit to train. That is also very good. We are seeing already light in the tunnel.\u201d He was cautiously optimistic regarding \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda\u2019s hamstring tear: \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad injury, but I am not a doctor.

Except, of course, for Richard Flanagan\u2019s The Narrow Road to the Deep North (Chatto &amp; Windus \u00a316.99), a profound and affecting masterpiece about a Japanese POW camp on the Burma death railway, which richly deserved its Booker win. Not an easy read, but a hugely rewarding one. And a favourite for me because it\u2019s the first time I have read a Booker winner ahead of the book actually winning the prize. Usually if I\u2019ve read your book, it means you will lose. This was a year for books that comfortably bridged the literary-commercial divide. Which is exactly where Sarah Waters\u2019s hugely enjoyable suffragette-era The Paying Guests (Virago \u00a320) fits in alongside Kate Mosse\u2019s excellent page-turner The Taxidermist\u2019s Daughter (Orion \u00a316.99). Both are tightly-woven psychological thrillers, with Mosse offering a characteristic hint of the gothic and Waters painting a jaw-droppingly detailed historical portrait of a doomed love affair. The romantic-comedy-in-novel-form, Us (Hodder \u00a320) by David Nicholls, falls neatly into this category too: not quite literary, not overtly commercial, Us is an entertaining and clever crossover read. For my money, it\u2019s one of the best portrayals of the complexities of a long-term relationship I\u2019ve seen in a contemporary novel as well as being a rather wonderful whistlestop tour around some of the great cities of Europe. InterRail meets marriage guidance. Original, thought-provoking and, importantly, fun. Martin Amis\u2019s The Zone of Interest (Jonathan Cape \u00a318.99) was easily the most underrated, almost ignored, novel of the year. Rejected by Amis\u2019s German publisher and rubbished by key critics, it is supremely, wantonly funny and breathtakingly audacious. (Note: I am not an Amis obsessive.) Worth buying just to read the acknowledgments, where he goes to great lengths to attempt to justify the arrogance of writing a quasi-satirical novel set in a Nazi concentration camp. There\u2019s something extraordinarily touching about the fact that Amis has evidently been building up the courage to write this book for decades and has dutifully done all the background reading to prove it. He didn\u2019t need to justify it: it\u2019s a brilliant feat of imagination and chutzpah. If you are a fan of the darkly, obscenely comic, you\u2019ll be able to stomach it. Not exactly overlooked but hardly overhyped either was The Bone Clocks (Sceptre \u00a320) by David Mitchell. It had a mixed reception from critics (and, like Us, didn\u2019t make it past the Booker longlist). This is a fantastical, ambitious, bold and exuberant read involving time travel and immortality. Its playful eccentricity and lightness of touch are reminiscent of Bulgakov\u2019s The Master and Margarita. Also needlessly damned with faint praise: The Children Act (Jonathan Cape \u00a316.99) by Ian McEwan. Taut and concise, this explores the personal and professional dilemmas faced by a family court judge. The reading year culminated with two hotly anticipated books: Jane Smiley\u2019s masterful, lyrical Some Luck (Mantle \u00a318.99), the first of a multi-voiced trilogy which opens on a remote farm in Iowa in the 1920s, and Elif Shafak\u2019s The Architect\u2019s Apprentice (Viking \u00a314.99), the story of an elephant tamer in the sultan\u2019s court of the Ottoman empire. Turkey\u2019s most successful female novelist, Shafak has been flirting with mainstream commercial success. This could (and should) be the novel that changes everything for her. Finally the book of the year has to go to The Miniaturist (Picador \u00a312.99) by Jessie Burton, the fastest-selling debut since Fifty Shades of Grey. The writing is fluid and addictive and the story grows out of the most irritatingly brilliant idea imaginable: in 17th-century Amsterdam, a bride receives a doll\u2019s house that is an exact replica of her new household. The Miniaturist is not the perfect novel (and rightly so \u2013 it\u2019s a debut) but its success represents a much-needed shot in the arm for the publishing industry and is a ray of hope for new writers everywhere.", "sentences": ["The writing is fluid and addictive and the story grows out of the most irritatingly brilliant idea imaginable: in 17th-century Amsterdam, a bride receives a doll\u2019s house that is an exact replica of her new household."], "title": "The best fiction of 2014", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/07/best-fiction-2014-flanagan-nicholls-waters-amis-mitchell-mcewan", "tags": ["Fiction", "Best books of 2014", "Richard Flanagan", "Sarah Waters", "David Nicholls", "Martin Amis", "David Mitchell", "Ian McEwan", "Jane Smiley", "Books", "Culture", "Books"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-09T19:02:28Z", "article": "  Uber has been banned in Spain and Thailand, adding to a week of woes for the US-based taxi service that has also seen bans in India and the Netherlands and a lawsuit from the city authorities in Portland, Oregon. In Spain a judge upheld a claim by the Madrid Taxi Association that Uber\u2019s drivers were not authorised to provide the service, which amounted to unfair competition. In his ruling the judge said that by not adhering to the norms governing the taxi service market Uber drivers were competing unfairly with licensed cabs. In Thailand the government said Uber drivers were neither registered nor insured to drive commercial vehicles. It added that its credit card system didn\u2019t comply with regulations. Meanwhile the City of Portland moved on Monday to shut down the service only days after it launched there. The latest troubles for the US tech company come after the Indian government stopped web-based, unregistered taxi companies from operating after a female passenger claimed that she was raped by an Uber driver in New Delhi. The driver, who has confessed, allegedly already faced rape charges but had a forged character reference signed by a police officer. This week a Dutch court banned the cheaper UberPop service, warning drivers they could face fines of \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,000) if they violate the ban. The premium UberBlack and UberLux services remain in operation in Amsterdam. Uber said it would fight the ban. The Spanish service began in Barcelona where the regional government has said it will ban it from 2015, threatening drivers with \u20ac6,000 fines. That has now been overridden by the judge\u2019s ruling which will also cover Valencia, the other Spanish city where Uber operates. \u201cWe believe we are offering a service within the spirit of the law. We will continue to offer safe, competitive, quality services to consumers,\u201d Uber spokesman Thomas van Oortmerssen said. \u201cThe law is out of date and that means the technological service we offer had not yet been invented,\u201d he added. \u201cThe law needs to be changed to make it possible and it is now up to the politicians to do that.\u201d The San Francisco-based service has faced opposition almost everywhere it has set up shop but has taken an aggressive stance against a sector that is almost universally heavily regulated and deeply protectionist.

Matisse: The Cut-Outs | Tate Modern, London This show took us from the late 1930s to the artist\u2019s death in 1954. At its heart was Matisse\u2019s sinuous cutting and slicing, not just of paper but of space itself; the scissor-sharp separation of colour and blankness, flatness and depth. Given their simpleness, Matisse\u2019s cut-outs had an extraordinary variety and inventiveness, yet the exhibition reminded us that the most expansive of them were made in a room that was both the artist\u2019s studio and his bedchamber. There, all the elements \u2013 pinned to the wall, piling up on desks and tables and doubtless the floor \u2013 were suspended in flux. Paper curled and drooped from the wall, trembled in draughts, and changed as light and shadows shifted round the walls. There is a flight from his infirmity and increasing physical limitations in these later works. They are so full of life.     Something much more than \u00adpicture-making \u2026 Henri Matisse\u2019s The Sheaf Photograph: PR    I imagine the sound as his big scissors carved through paper already stiffened by the gouache paint that had been applied to it. And Matisse, seated in a wheelchair, directing his assistants as they first helped him rotate the sheets as he cut the big shapes, then, under his direction, positioned them on the wall, hammering them to plaster with panel pins. Matisse admitted that he started pinning such shapes to the wall without much idea where it was all heading, though the essence of the technique had been with him for decades, as an aid to his painting, his collages, prints and book designs. Yet he did have a prescient awareness of their implications. \u201cIt seems to me I am anticipating things to come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will only be much later that people will realise to what extent the work I am doing today is in step with the future.\u201d The simplicity of means led to something much more than picture-making, or what some mistakenly saw as the scrapbook play of an elderly artist\u2019s second childhood. More fool them. Matisse had no time to spare in these late works, and nothing to prove. His awareness that time was limited gave these weightless works a paradoxical gravitas, as well as filling Tate Modern with the pulse of light and life, and the dance of the imagination. Loveliness proliferated. 2.

To the southwest is Lake Van, Turkey. It is also a high mountain lake but it does not freeze in the cold winters, because it is saline. Greenish waters mark Lake Urmia in Iran. Just two decades ago Lake Urmia was the largest saltwater lake in the Middle East and was home to a wide variety of species, such as pelicans and flamingos. Today the lake has shrunk markedly, and is little more than large salt flat.

The lake fluctuates from year to year due to natural variations in snowmelt and rainfall but human activity has played a key role in drawing down the lake over the past five decades, according to research published by scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Nearby Bole, a city of 425,000 people in the Boertala Valley, seen to the west of the lake, consumes significant amounts of water.

It\u2019s peak at 867 meters (2,844ft) is high enough to disrupt the clouds flowing around it producing a distinctive cloud pattern.

The crests of these waves raised and cooled the air enough to form clouds, while the troughs remain too low and warm for cloud formation.

The burn scars taper towards the north, indicating that winds from the south likely drove the fires away from start points on the agricultural fence line. For scale, the length of the fenceline is roughly 15km (9 miles).Burn scars are often the most arresting and dominant patterns visible from aircraft and spacecraft when flying over semi-arid regions. At least five fire episodes can be identified by their feather-like shapes in this image. Fires often start at or near rural, agricultural population centers.

By the following evening lava had overtaken the nearby National Park Headquarters, according to the Smithsonian\u2019s Global Volcanism Program.  New volcanic activity on 27 November, brought concerns that the nearby town of Portela may be entirely engulfed by lava. The approximately 1,000 residents were evacuated to safety.

Researchers have long studied these features, yet mystery continues to enshroud them. What is the source of lake water? How do the megadunes develop and evolve? The Badain Jaran in the Alxa Desert region of Inner Mongolia gives rise to megadunes that tower between 200 to 300 meters (660 to 980ft) tall. The tallest, at 460 meters (1,500ft), is about the same height as New York\u2019s Empire State Building. Scientists have recently combined Landsat images with gravity measurements of the hilly bedrock below to show that the dune\u2019s height is influenced by local geology rather than wind conditions and sand characteristics, as previously thought.

Geologists call it \u201cglacial flour\u201d or \u201crock flour.\u201d This substance often finds its way into rivers and lakes, colouring the water brown, grey, or aqua. When water levels are low, the flour can dry out on riverbanks and deltas and become dust for winds to lift into the air.A satellite captured this image of northerly winds blowing dust from the Copper River Delta over the Gulf of Alaska. Dust events are most common in this area in the fall, when river and lake levels in south central Alaska are at their lowest.

The extremely high salinity means fish cannot live in this water body, although there are bacteria and fungi. With the Jordan River as its main source of water, the Dead Sea is an \u2018endorheic\u2019 basin, meaning that the water has no outflow. Nonetheless, the water level has been dropping, an effect of the diversion of incoming water from the river. The greenish rectangles just south of the Sea are a large complex of mineral evaporation ponds used to produce sodium chloride and other salts for the chemical industry and human and animal consumption. These ponds are separated from the northern part of the Dead Sea by what once was the Lisan Peninsula but lowering water levels have exposed the sea bed, dividing the two sections completely. In the lower-left corner of the image, we can clearly see the division between Israel and the Gaza Strip not only by the outline of the border, but in the difference in agricultural practices.

Made more joyous by the Rio-based teen trio Pearls Negras, whose cutting verses and spliced-in ad-libs spiral the original from joy into a state of emergency, it\u2019s a fitting transformation for a song meant to support Garbus\u2019s new charity, dedicated to supporting water-related causes.

The mob contained many of the usual suspects from Israel\u2019s far right, including members of the religious extremist movement Lehava. What was more surprising was the identity of the man who coordinated the attack: Yoav Eliasi, better known to the Israeli public by his rap name, The Shadow. Eliasi took to Facebook to encourage his followers to fight against \u201cIsrael-hating leftists\u201d and was pictured in newspapers marshalling the mob. The assault came less than a year after Eliasi\u2019s former recording partner Ya\u2019akov \u201cKobi\u201d Shimoni AKA Subliminal, in the wake of the murder of an Israeli soldier by a Palestinian man, had called on Israel to \u201cburn the prisons\u201d housing Palestinians and \u201cdestroy [the Palestinian city of] Jenin\u201d. For some critics, Eliasi and Shimoni\u2019s outbursts are indicative of what Asher Schechter, a journalist for the English-language newspaper Haaretz, describes as \u201ca deep process of right-leaning radicalisation\u201d in Israel, where the term \u201cleftist\u201d has assumed negative connotations and talk of reconciliation with the Palestinians is seen as defeatism. Yet, while Eliasi and Shimoni\u2019s viewpoint may chime with populist opinion, within Israeli hip-hop theirs is far from the only political stance. Unlike much of the national discourse, the scene is allowing voices from all sides of the spectrum to be broadcast, some confrontational, some conciliatory. Sameh Zakout AKA Saz is in the latter group. A Palestinian rapper who lives in Israel, he preaches a form of hip-hop that, while frank and frustrated about the treatment meted out to Palestinians, largely eschews the political minutiae for a wider message of unity. Last month, he was the lone Palestinian performer at Tune In Tel Aviv, a showcase designed to promote Israeli artists to the western market. Saz describes himself as an \u201cinternational ethnic rapper\u201d, and has the ambitious aim of being \u201cthe first Arab sex symbol to the world. It sounds corny, but I\u2019d rather be the bridge to bring people together than be the bomb that divides them.\u201d            The history of Israeli hip-hop runs back to the mid-90s, when the advent of cable TV introduced the likes of Tupac and Notorious BIG to a culture weaned on rock. \u201cBack then, everything was love songs with guitars,\u201d explains Khen Rotem AKA Sagol 59, a Jerusalem rapper considered to be one of Israeli hip-hop\u2019s progenitors. \u201cThere was no Hebrew hip-hop at all. We had to invent a language from scratch.\u201d A new style was forged in the clubs of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, where MCs would freestyle in both English and Hebrew. The first artists to capitalise on this nascent scene were Subliminal and The Shadow. \u201cIf you equate these things [to US hip-hop] they were like 50 Cent or Jay Z,\u201d explains Rhotem. \u201cBig beats, parties, swagger, but with a bit of nationalistic stuff. They cemented in the Israeli media the way an Israeli rapper should look and sound.\u201d That look and sound was unapologetically rightwing Zionist, supportive of the military and antagonistic towards both Palestine and the Israeli left. Such sentiments proved popular with Israeli audiences; Subliminal built a Jay Z-style empire, including a record label and a clothing line. Around the same time, the Palestinian hip-hop crew DAM emerged, led by rapper Tamer Nafar. Hailing from the impoverished Israeli city of Lod, DAM\u2019s worldview was strikingly different from that of Shimoni and Eliasi. They rapped in Arabic and their focus was on the plight of Palestinians, not only in Gaza and the West Bank, but also the significant number who, like them, lived in Israel and felt marginalised. In the early years, Nafar and Shimoni were friends. However, the events of the second intifada [2000\u2019s Palestinian uprising] intensified the political streak in both artists. Subliminal and his crew amped up their nationalist rhetoric, while DAM became more outspoken about the Israeli occupation. The relationship between the two crews deteriorated rapidly, a falling-out that is captured in the 2005 documentary Channels Of Rage.            If Subliminal and DAM are evidence of Israeli hip-hop\u2019s capability to divide, others are looking to use the scene as a unifying force. Sagol 59, a left-leaning rapper who grew up in a kibbutz, has spent much of his career trying to create a dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian rappers. He devised the Corner Prophets initiative, a regular club night in Jerusalem where anyone could MC. \u201cThere\u2019s no hierarchy,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf an Arab guy wanted to come and do his thing or an ultra-orthodox girl from a settlement wanted to say her thing, they could.\u201d Sagol 59 has also collaborated with Palestinian rappers, most recently in September at a concert arranged by the MasterPeace initiative in Amsterdam, where he took the stage with Saz in front of an audience of 17,000. While Sagol 59 and Saz are relative veterans, fresh voices are beginning to be heard in the region. System Ali are a collective featuring Israelis, Palestinians and Uzbeks who formed in a bomb shelter in the historic city of Jaffa. Rapping in Hebrew, Arabic, English and Russian, they rail against inequality in their home town, where forced demolitions have made both Jews and Arabs feel like second-class citizens. Elsewhere, groups such as Kafe Shahor Hazak represent the country\u2019s sizeable Ethiopean-Israeli population. Not everyone is political, though: Itay Lukach is an overweight rapper who makes comedy songs about his love of food and Pro Evolution Soccer. For Sagol, the growing plurality of voices on all sides is evidence of a decisive shift in the genre, one that allows people of all political stripes to express their views clearly and openly. \u201cI always say that Israeli hip-hop moved backwards to American hip-hop. American hip-hop started out on the streets and went really commercial. Here it was at first commercial and now it\u2019s going back to the underground stuff.\u201d Saz agrees: \u201cThere are young people who are coming up now and they\u2019re great because they\u2019re coming from the bottom of hip-hop. The golden rule they all adhere to is \u2018be yourself\u2019. Do not try to mimic American hip-hop. Be honest.

Prior to its first opening, in\u00a01748, classical music had been performed in churches, royal courts and artistocratic houses. But the\u00a0emerging middle classes needed something more: they were making music at home but wanted to hear it in\u00a0public spaces, to meet like-minded people and to put their cultural tastes on show. Societies of music lovers sprang up in major cities with the purpose of setting up orchestras and building concert halls. In 1813, the newly formed Royal Philharmonic Society of London commissioned the\u00a0architect John Nash to renovate the\u00a0Argyll Rooms opposite what is now\u00a0the\u00a0Apple Store on Regent Street, London, and created a concert hall. Similar societies in Leipzig, Vienna and\u00a0Liverpool were responsible for the\u00a0building of new halls for music. As the industrial revolution progressed, the concert halls got bigger, with venues such as Birmingham\u2019s Greek temple-style town hall of 1834 and steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie\u2019s famous \u00a01891 concert hall in New York, becoming symbols of civic pride and industrial new money. More recently, concert halls have been conceived with broader social purposes in mind. The Royal Festival Hall was built as part of the Festival of\u00a0Britain to raise spirits after the war; Birmingham\u2019s 1991 Symphony Hall was seen as crucial to the regeneration of an economically depressed city and Sage Gateshead opened in 2004, providing a world-class concert hall and a focal point for community music and education in the north-east of England. The latest concert hall project with far-reaching social ambitions is the Philharmonie de Paris, which will open next month on the eastern edge of the French capital.     An exterior view of the Philharmonie de Paris. Photograph: Atelier Jean Nouvel    The Philharmonie is a huge, organic structure rising up in the Parc de la Villette, the arts and science park built just inside the boulevard p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique on the site of the old Paris meat market and abattoirs. It is the latest and, sadly, possibly the last major manifestation of the energy and willpower of Pierre Boulez, composer, conductor and the godfather of music in France. For more than half a century, Boulez has used his influence to get concert halls built, ensembles founded and music research centres established. At 89, he is now in\u00a0poor health, but his spirit is everywhere throughout this project. The neighbouring Cit\u00e9 de la Musique (which will come under the management of the Philharmonie and will be renamed Philharmonie 2) opened in 1995 and realised Boulez\u2019s dream for a flexible concert hall fit for the 21st century: wired for electronic sound, capable of changing shape and layout to accommodate contemporary works such as his own spatial masterpiece, Repons, and incorporating a museum and education spaces. But, with 900 seats, the Cit\u00e9 was too small for big symphony orchestras, and Boulez was\u00a0soon planning a bigger version.     \u2018Godfather of music\u2019 \u2026 Pierre Boulez. Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images    Its construction has sparked controversy \u2013 over the location and, especially, the escalating costs to the city of Paris and the French government. Priced at an estimated \u20ac381m (\u00a3303m), it will rank among the most expensive concert halls in the world. And even before its opening, the Philharmonie\u2019s artistic lineup is\u00a0attracting complaints both of elitism and of dumbing down. But the venue is a glamorous architectural statement, designed by French star architect Jean Nouvel, whose credits include the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly and the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris as well as concert halls in\u00a0Lucerne and Copenhagen. From a\u00a0distance, it looks like a great, geological mound, as if some seismic event had created a mountain. Move nearer and you can see its external walls, billowing like folds of cloth. From yet another angle, the building looks like a huge bird that has landed on the park - and Nouvel continues the avian theme by cladding many of the outside surfaces, underfoot and on walls, with\u00a0200,000 tiles in the shape of flying birds in what must be 50 shades of grey aluminium. But most classical music lovers will tell you that it\u2019s the inside of a concert hall that counts: the great halls are the ones with great acoustics. It\u2019s all highly subjective, but the top three acoustics are generally agreed to be the Musikverein in Vienna, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and Symphony Hall in Boston. All three were built during the second half of the 19th century, the first building boom for purpose built concert halls when cities saw them as a source of civic pride. In those days, acoustics was still one of the dark arts rather than a precise science, but these halls have in common the shoebox shape, a long rectangle in which the performers are positioned at one end and where straight, high walls reflect and blend the sound.     Berlin Philharmonie. Photograph: Dennis Gilbert/View Pictures    By the mid 20th century, architects believed that the formal, hierarchical layouts of these concert halls were outdated, reflecting the social order of their times. In the ruins of postwar Berlin, Hans Scharoun built the Berlin Philharmonie (opened in 1963) to reflect a more democratic ideal, a \u201cnew society\u201d in Scharoun\u2019s words: the performers are in the centre and the audience encircle them in sloping terraces, an arrangement that came to be known as\u00a0the vineyard model. Scharoun employed the latest acoustic science to ensure that the Berlin hall sounds as glorious as it looks, and its vineyard design became the inspiration for many new halls around the world: from Disney Hall in LA to Manchester\u2019s Bridgewater Hall, Suntory Hall in Tokyo and the long delayed and still unopened Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg. Simon Rattle insisted on the 19th-century shoebox shape for Symphony Hall in Birmingham, built in 1990 when\u00a0he was in charge of the City of\u00a0Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. The\u00a0Philharmonie de Paris has the best\u00a0of both worlds. The basic design is\u00a0vineyard, but some very sexy technology means that banks of seating can disappear into walls to create a shoebox, or a standing venue for rock and pop concerts. As with the Philharmonie in Berlin, the acoustic is enhanced by floating \u201cclouds\u201d, wooden acoustic reflectors that control the sound in the space. And there is an ingenious solution to one of the key tensions in concert hall design: the need for a large volume of space for the sound to resonate, while allowing the audience to be close to the action. The Philharmonie\u2019s banks of seating are nested inside the much larger shell of\u00a0the hall, floating free of its walls, making for an intimate experience in a\u00a0large space: \u201cno audience member will be more than 32 metres away from the performers,\u201d says chief executive Laurent Bayle, \u201cbut the room is large enough to be very resonant.\u201d But the new building must fulfil a social as well as a musical function, and when visiting I am reminded that the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique is more than a traffic artery. It is a social barrier: on one side, the Haussmann boulevards and creamy beige limestone of the ancient centre of Paris, home to cultural institutions and wealthy urbanites; on the other, the banlieues, the edgier, poorer, multicultural suburbs French politicians are trying to bridge this divide with a vision of \u201cGrand Paris\u201d, an integrated city with more equality of opportunity. The new tramline that weaves its way in and out of the suburbs and has a stop outside the new concert hall is symbolic of this ambition, and so, too, is the Philharmonie de Paris.     Sage Gateshead. Photograph: Mark Pinder    The views from the roof terrace, 37 metres above street level \u2013 whether of the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur and central Paris to the west, or of the suburbs and the hills to the east \u2013 offer a reminder of Bayle\u2019s desire to embrace new horizons. \u201cThis is a new vision for a concert hall \u2013 and one of the most important things about it is the location. Classical music has been concentrated in the west of the city, which is wealthy; the Salle Pleyel, Radio France [which has itself just opened a new concert hall], the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs Elys\u00e9es. From this place, we can reach out to a whole new audience \u2013 we can unite the suburbs and the city centre \u2013 it\u2019s Grand Paris,\u201d he says. The East wall of the building quite literally does reach out to the suburbs: a giant, digital screen will project images and words across the Peripherique towards the banlieu of Pantin. In the brochure for the opening season, Bayle opposes the idea that classical music should be linked to social class. He wants to \u201cbreak down the barriers, shake up the ritual of the concert, prioritise education programmes for young people and make links between musical genres\u201d. To do all this, he will have at his disposal a\u00a02,200-seat concert hall, rehearsal rooms with public galleries, extensive workshop spaces which can take school groups and staff who can look after children while parents attend a concert. There will also be a gallery space, whose first exhibition will be the V&amp;A\u2019s David Bowie show, as\u00a0well as cafes and restaurants. But what of the music? It will be a\u00a0more diverse mix than is usual in French musical institutions. Classical will dominate, with the Orchestre de Paris and Ensemble InterContemporain in residence, and it will provide a Paris venue for visiting European orchestras such as the LSO, the Royal Concertgebouw of Amsterdam, the Berlin Philharmonic, as well as the New York Philharmonic, the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Orchestra of Venezuela or the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra. But weekends will also be themed on topics such as New York, Bowie, science fiction, the human voice, amateur music and love stories, exploring ideas across all genres of music in concerts, workshops and talks.     Orchestre de Paris. Photograph Jean Baptiste Pellerin    If all this seems familiar to British audiences already au fait with eclectic programming of Southbank Centre, the Barbican, Sage Gateshead, Birmingham or Glasgow Concert Halls, it represents a radical step in France, where classical culture has enjoyed far higher state support and its importance has gone largely unchallenged. Last month, a study from the University of Limoges found that the average age of classical concertgoers in France has risen from\u00a036 in 1981 to 61 today: Bayle\u2019s desire to shake things up\u00a0is timely. Glamorous design, great acoustics and a classy programme guarantee that\u00a0the Philharmonie de Paris will be a\u00a0major new landmark in Paris and a great asset to the international community of musicians and music lovers who will enjoy its gleaming new spaces. But its ambitions are greater than that. It is aiming for nothing less than social transformation through the arts. Gillian Moore is head of classical music at London\u2019s Southbank Centre.

Benchmark Brent crude has dropped 47% since June and fell to just over $61 a barrel as the IEA warned of the threat of global social instability and the potential for financial defaults in big producer countries such as Venezuela and Russia. The oil price has plummeted in response to a massive buildup of shale-derived oil in the US, reduced fears of fighting in Iraq disrupting supplies, and slower growth in demand as the world economy falters. A decision by the Opec two weeks ago to keep its production at existing levels has been taken as a signal by traders and shippers that the producers\u2019 cartel is happy to see prices fall for the forseeable future. The IEA said in its December monthly oil report that it was cutting its 2015 demand growth forecast by 230,000 barrels a day to 900,000, partly because of falling output in former Soviet countries. It believed surging US oil supply would push total non-Opec output to a record increase, averaged over the year, of 1.9m barrels a day for 2014, but predicted \u201cthe pace is expected to slow to 1.3m barrels a day for next year.\u201d It also warned: \u201cThe resulting downward price pressure would raise the risk of social instability or financial difficulties if producers found it difficult to pay back debt.\u201d The Paris-based IEA singled out Russia and Venezuela as potential flashpoints for trouble and the warning came as the rouble, which has lost 40% in value against the dollar so far this year, hit a fresh record low. One dollar now buys more than 57 roubles, compared with 35 in the summer. But while the oil-producing countries face lost revenues and budget shortfalls, lower energy prices are expected to have a beneficial impact on the world economy. Many countries, particularly in Asia, are desperately dependent on foreign oil and gas imports, so cheaper prices should cut inflation and give impetus to manufacturing output and consumer spending. Analysts at investment bank ING said: \u201cThe recent fall in oil prices may not be sustained but, in the meantime, it provides a very welcome boost to real incomes for most major economies. In time, low oil prices themselves should be their own undoing, as supply withers, although politics will remain a further layer of uncertainty.\u201d Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, said: \u201c[Oil] is following the trend lower. The market has reacted strongly to the Opec forecast cut, and it is focusing only on the negative.\u201d Lower energy prices will cause havoc in the UK North Sea, where companies such as BP and Shell are cutting jobs at a time when exploration levels have already dropped to very low levels. But householders will welcome the falling gas price cutting heating bills, while motorists will be glad of lower costs at the pump. High home and transport costs are a big influence on inflation and affect the production and distribution of food and other items. Asda, Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s all announced they were reducing the price of their petrol by 2p a litre and knocking 1p a litre off diesel. The Tesco cut took effect from lunchtime on Friday , while the other three big supermarkets will introduce the lower prices from tomorrow. The average UK price of petrol has now dropped below \u00a31.20 a litre and is at its lowest level since December 2010, according to government figures. Airlines have said they expect air fares to fall next year if the lower prices continue, but have warned that there are unlikely to be immediate reductions because fuel is bought a long time in advance of use. There are strong signs in the US that lower energy prices are having a big effect on consumer spending with store and restaurant sales rising by 5% in November against the same month the previous year. One reason for lower prices is the weak state of the global economy, and no one can predict with accuracy whether oil prices will stay at the current levels or fall further. Tom Kloza, co-founder of the US-based Oil Price Information Service, has warned that the world could be heading for $45 per barrel oil, although he maintained that this kind of price was not sustainable longterm.", "sentences": ["In time, low oil prices themselves should be their own undoing, as supply withers, although politics will remain a further layer of uncertainty.\u201d Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, said: \u201c[Oil] is following the trend lower."], "title": "Oil price plunge continues as IEA forecasts weaker demand in 2015", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/12/oil-price-plunge-brent-crude-iea-forecasts-weaker-demand-2015", "tags": ["Oil", "Commodities", "Business", "Oil", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Environment", "Oil and gas companies", "Energy industry", "US economic growth and recession", "Economics", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Economic policy", "Russia", "Venezuela", "US news", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-14T05:06:13Z", "article": "What\u2019s striking about the so-called refugee debate is that, for all the acres of newsprint devoted to arguing about asylum seekers, there\u2019s so little discussion of the most basic questions.  Yes, if Australia set out to make seeking refuge safer rather than more dangerous, more people would come here. Why would that be bad? The usual argument for maintaining Fortress Australia takes for granted that the arrival of desperate people represents a problem. Yet the available academic work suggests that, on the contrary, immigrants stimulate the economy, create jobs, and generate tax revenue.  Michael Clemens argues, for instance, that \u201cthe world impoverishes itself much more through blocking international migration than any other single class of international policy\u201d.  Of course, the research is complicated. Yet the anti-refugee consensus seems to have cohered without any engagement with the literature at all. The debate has shifted so much that, at the moment, any suggestion that refugees aren\u2019t deserving of punishment merely for seeking refuge sounds utterly utopian. But, of course, it\u2019s not. In 1886, the Statue of Liberty was constructed in Manhattan, a gift from the people of France to the people of the US. The iconic monument contains lines from the poet Emma Lazarus, in an explicit welcome to refugees:  Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!  Strangely, the statue says nothing about imprisoning the masses indefinitely in camps outsourced to impoverished neighbours. If such ideals could be engraved in stone in the 19th century, what makes them so unthinkable today?  Certainly, it\u2019s never been clearer that we need a different approach.  Daniel Webb, from the Human Rights Law Centre noted of Scott Morrison\u2019s recent refugee amendments:   Morrison\u2019s tactics quite literally made these children the hostages of his political agenda. Their rights and liberty in no way hinged on a principled assessment of the necessity for their detention. Their freedom didn\u2019t depend on any assessment of their wellbeing or of the harm being caused by their incarceration. Their futures had absolutely nothing to do with any consideration of their human rights.  Give me more power \u2013 or the kids will never see daylight. It\u2019s the conduct of a kidnapper, as Julian Burnside said. This kind of moral blackmail has underpinned Australia\u2019s harsh refugee policies for years, with the drownings of asylum seekers used to justify each new piece of bastardry. Those who hesitate about endorsing the camps are told that the sinkings will be on their conscience. It\u2019s a striking piece of rhetorical ju-jitsu, a move that doesn\u2019t deny the cruelty of the detention regime so much as present that oppression as a force for good. Actually, we\u2019re told, Australia\u2019s stopping the boats to stop the deaths. Why, we\u2019re helping the refugees \u2013 it\u2019s for their benefit that we construct the gulags. Moreover, once you accept the logic of deterrence, escalation becomes inevitable, because lesser evildom legitimises almost any measure that leaves refugees alive \u2013 and even some that don\u2019t. By definition, a policy of the lesser evil still mandates evil, which should, in and of itself, be a warning. A commitment to cruelty surely represents a fundamental social failure, whatever its justification. So how did we get here? Refugee advocates often accept the government\u2019s framing, for fear of appearing utopian. It seems more politically realistic to accept the bipartisan commitment to deterrence and then just haggle around the edges. But from the perspective of the asylum seekers themselves, the whole debate seems crazy. For they can\u2019t help be aware that the government itself generates the dangers from which it claims to be saving them. Asylum seekers do not drown because of natural disasters. The crossing between Indonesian and Australia presents no particular perils. Thousands of people go back and forth between the two nations every year without incident. Asylum seekers die because of illegality. Since they\u2019re breaking the law, they can\u2019t travel in a safe vessel. They must rely on criminals, men using clapped out fishing boats that avoid routes where they might be seen. That\u2019s why people drown. They\u2019re on leaky craft organised by criminals, and they\u2019re too scared to call for help when they get into trouble. As I\u2019ve argued elsewhere, the best analogy for the war on refugees is the war on drugs. By and large, addicts aren\u2019t killed by the drugs they take. It\u2019s perfectly possible to inject drugs safely. Doctors do it all the time. Addicts die from adulterated mixtures; they die because they\u2019re scoring from other addicts in back alleys and no-one really knows what each shot contains. Statistics show that in nearly half the cases of overdose in the US, no-one calls an ambulance, out of fear of arrest if the authorities come. Because drugs are banned, users buy from criminals, meaning that an addiction often leads to a broader delinquency. To put it another way, the illegality of the drug trade creates the tragedies then used to justify further anti-drug crackdowns.  For the last 40 years, most of the world has been trapped in this vicious circle, with the resources poured into policing narcotics fuelling an ever-worsening problem. Of course, critics of the war on drugs have been silenced by the same kind of moral blackmail used in the refugee debate. Reforming politicians are told that, unless they support tough laws, they\u2019re personally responsible for the 13-year-old schoolgirl overdosing behind the shelter sheds. Fortunately, that\u2019s now changing. You\u2019ve probably seen the widely-shared example of what a different approach to drugs looks like: the image of a flyer from Amsterdam warning against a bad batch of cocaine. \u201cYou will not be arrested for using drugs in Amsterdam,\u201d the leaflet reads. It offers practical tips for keeping victims of an overdose conscious until help arrives. It\u2019s called harm minimisation, an approach entirely missing from our remarkably narrow refugee \u201cdebate\u201d. People are going to take drugs; people are going to flee oppression. You can\u2019t prevent men and women in fear for their lives from seeking safety \u2013 not unless you are willing for them to die.  Even if you construct the most fearful deterrent, all you\u2019re doing is ensuring they succumb to a threat that otherwise they might have escaped. There is no humanitarian dividend from the system of detention camps: it just shifts the deaths from one place to another. Again, we need a new conversation about refugee policy, one that begins with harm minimisation. What would that mean? For a start, it would mean accepting \u2013 truly accepting \u2013 the right to seek refuge. No politician will come out openly to say that the persecuted should not be permitted to escape their tormentors, because that would be an outrageous argument \u2013 essentially, a justification for oppression. In practice, however, Australian policy operates to make seeking asylum as difficult as possible, hence the close co-operation with the murderous Sri Lankan regime. Yet, in a globalised world, with the international economy restructured to facilitate the circulation of commodities, you cannot prevent population flows. All you can do is make them more dangerous and more deadly. Why should that be a policy goal? Authoritarian policies normalise themselves and grow, until they no longer distinguish between citizen and non-citizen.  You can already see the process at work. As Ben Doherty argued in Guardian Australia a few days back, Morrison has now become \u201cthe most powerful person in the Australian government\u201d, with \u201cunprecedented, unchallengeable, and secret powers to control the lives of asylum seekers\u201d. A few years back, an Australian politician used the freedom of little children as a bargaining chip would have been hounded from office as monster. In 2014, however, Morrison is lauded as a potential leader, one of the few stars in Abbott\u2019s galaxy of duds. Today, the imperial powers granted to our refugee king seem anomalous. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll find other ministers equally keen to be divested of annoying checks and balances. Australia\u2019s treatment of refugees isn\u2019t simply a humanitarian failure. It\u2019s an ugly cancer on the body politic \u2013 and cancers have an alarming tendency to spread.", "sentences": ["You\u2019ve probably seen the widely-shared example of what a different approach to drugs looks like: the image of a flyer from Amsterdam warning against a bad batch of cocaine.", "\u201cYou will not be arrested for using drugs in Amsterdam,\u201d the leaflet reads."], "title": "On asylum seekers, a 'lesser evil' approach still mandates evil.

Rembrandt: The Late Works | National Gallery, London This was staggering: the kind of show you never ever expect to see, for which museums all over the world yield up their most treasured possessions just so that the gallery-goers of one country can witness Rembrandt\u2019s last decade in all its concentrated intensity. It set countless masterworks before you, from the overwhelming tenderness of The Jewish Bride to the fantastically alert Syndics, each one eyeballing the viewer from a different direction; from the tragic Anatomy Lesson to the haunting nightmare of Lucretia about to stab herself (not once but twice, in before-and-after pictures), knife in hand, sleepwalking towards death.     Tragic \u2026 The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Joan Deyman, 1656. Photograph: Amsterdam Museum    There were surprises throughout, though, no matter how well you thought you knew Rembrandt. Sweden sent a picture never shown in Britain before: The Conspiracy of the Batavians Under Claudius Civilis, which stopped visitors in their tracks with its shadow-play of raw-faced warriors illuminated from below and dominated by the towering Civilis, who had one eye working but the other a horrendous gaping socket. It was a commission for Amsterdam town hall, but Rembrandt wouldn\u2019t compromise on the outlandishness of the picture. He was never paid; the picture was taken down almost immediately. This defiance was everywhere apparent at the National Gallery: in the magnificent impasto of the husband\u2019s sleeve in The Jewish Bride, nubs of paint fully an inch thick, but setting off such a twinkling interplay of golden-yellow light; in the strange, rheumy-eyed Christ child looking up at Saint Simeon in the freezing cold of Christmas; in the weird self-portrait at the start, a tiny etching in which Rembrandt shows himself pig-eyed, flaccid and confused, otherwise nearly faceless where he has simply wiped himself out of the plate. There was an unexpected intimacy to the whole event. It showed Rembrandt out in the countryside \u2013 from which he seems to recoil \u2013 in tiny drawings; visiting his friends and neighbours in their diamond-paned Amsterdam homes; taking a boat to sketch the corpse of a maid, dangling pitifully from the gallows. But I couldn\u2019t help circling back to the self-portraits in the first room time and again, with their inexhaustible range of emotional nuance. They represent the fons et origo of everything to come: the artist in all his doubt, courage, shambolic pathos, humanity, profundity, shrewdness, sadness and power.

We learned that tourism is now the main foreign exchange earner, supplanting sugar. Che Guevara, Ernest Hemingway, vintage cars, Havana cigars and the Buena Vista Social Club have all been co-opted as attractions. But most people\u2019s lives are marked more by hardship than by romantic memories. The UN estimates Cuba\u2019s per capita income at $6,300 in 2012, just above that of China and Thailand. Income is mainly in the form of a food ration and free social services. Most wages are paid by the government and amount to no more than pocket money. But when Fidel stepped down from the presidency to be replaced by his brother Raoul \u2013 duly elected by parliament \u2013 there was a shift away from political ideology towards economic pragmatism. Many businesses are now privately owned and pay taxes. One capitalistic habit has been embraced enthusiastically: tipping. At every restaurant our guide reminded us to tip 10% of the bill, in addition to what we paid the strolling musicians. We accumulated pocketfuls of small coins to pay our way in public toilets. Chambermaids left us handwritten notes, exhorting us to enjoy our stay. We took these to be friendly invoices for their services.

He suggested that at that time of year we had nothing to celebrate. This is very far from the point (literally). Yule is the opposite point on the wheel of seasons from midsummer. To celebrate yuletide is to celebrate the day after which the hours of sunlight increase. Many modern countries celebrate this rather than Christ\u2019s birthday. The only word in some Baltic nations for Christmas is the translation of yule. Jul in Denmark, joulu in Finland, and Sweden\u2019s is julen. So in the land of Father Christmas, Finland, he is called Joulupukki, which translates as the yule buck. But, as stories mutate he is just the man in red who arrives pulled by the yule buck.Andrew YoudTurku, Finland We must save the NHS We are very fortunate to have the NHS and in no way would I wish to see it privatised (5 December). However, I see a problem that every government kicks down the road. The very success of the NHS contains the seeds of its own destruction. When the NHS was established in the 1950s medicine was a great deal simpler. You got your medicines, then much cheaper, or you went to hospital to have broken bones healed, or to die. Now scientific advances have made operations much more complex and expensive, with new hips, kidney, liver and heart transplants. Dying is not an option. In addition, because we are living much longer the care and other costs are mounting exponentially. Scientific advance will continue so the NHS will become a bottomless pit of expense. So what is the solution? One could cap the type of operations available on the NHS to limit the cost. However, we do not want health only available to the wealthy and that would be the inevitable effect. This problem cannot be solved by paying the NHS staff peanuts, which is the present policy. Nor can it be entirely solved by automation. No one wants their hand held or brow mopped by a robot. Similarly it would not be acceptable to limit treatment to those under a certain age. I do not see the answer to the problem, but it needs to be faced by us all and not just left to the government of the day to find an ad hoc solution.Geoffrey H LevyAndover, UK Truth about cats and humans The article in your 21 November issue about the domestication of cats has no clue about ecology. The closing remark about cats killing lovable little creatures is astonishing. Whatever effect kindness and affection may have had on the human-cat relationship, the way it started is that humans, by storing food in primitive shelters, made their habitations into breeding places for rodents, which raided their grain stores. The wealth of rodents made people\u2019s farms into feeding places for small felids. The relationship between cats and people started out as strictly business and even today most farmers are not inclined to feed the cats. That would be bad for business! That contemporary cats are lovable may of course have developed as the article avers \u2013 but as a byproduct.Dave SchmalzAmsterdam, the Netherlands There is more danger now Since this year marks the 100th anniversary of the horrors of the first world war, aversion to war should be high. Yet there\u2019s little questioning of the sanity of continually erupting wars perpetrated by western powers on Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia. These wars, costing trillions of dollars, divide and damage countries, causing misery, chaos and cycles of continual violence. The new Ukraine conflict, with the US and EU baiting Russia, terrifyingly risks annihilating all life on earth through the potential use of nuclear weapons, which can also be released accidentally, especially under conflict pressures. Your story, A cold war for the 21st century (28 November), claims the worst excesses of the original cold war are largely absent. But a huge increase in US military bases worldwide has stimulated a nuclear weapons arms race and the modernisation of nuclear weapons; they can be released now in a few minutes, rather than the longer time it used to take. There\u2019s more danger now with less time for correcting errors of judgment. Kay WeirWellington, New Zealand Groupthink is the problem Owen Jones (28 November) seems not to have noticed the basic fact about humanity: we live in social groups. It is within these groups that \u201cselflessness and cooperation make evolutionary sense\u201d but in conflicts between groups (ie wars) that we are \u201ccapable of sickening cruelty against other human beings\u201d. These groups are defined by the information they share. Originally they were extended families and all the information was in their DNA, but every advance in communication from language itself (some 50,000 years ago) to writing (5,000) to printing (500) and television (50) allowed them to get bigger by facilitating that sharing. The bigger the group, the more unequal its members became, and attempts to remedy it by violence ended badly. Hence, the gradual social democratic approach favoured by us Guardian readers.Graham AndrewsSpokane, Washington, US Briefly \u2022 Eric Schlosser (5 December), rightly fearing the dangers posed by nuclear weapons in war or via accidents at a base, says that Iran, for these reasons, must never get the bomb. His concern for the Iranian people doesn\u2019t seem to extend to Israel, where an accident would not only endanger the Israelis, but also those in lands it has annexed, built on, and occupied.Ivor TittawellaUme\u00e5, Sweden \u2022 Mike Selvey is right that the bowler will be as devastated as anybody over Phillip Hughes\u2019s death (5 December). But why was he bowling at the batsman\u2019s head? The principle of cricket is to bowl towards the stumps for the chance of a wicket for the bowler or of a score for the batter. Too wide of the stumps is disallowed, so why not too high equally?Adrian BethamLondon, UK \u2022 Dirty supermarket chicken (5 December) is one episode in a decade-long row of abominable scandals in the meat industry. Judging by consumer watchdogs\u2019 publications, spoiled meat has been the new standard for a long time. Supermarket bosses should be ashamed, indeed. It is time, however, to also raise the following question: why is it that countless well-informed consumers are still so eager to buy what is evidentially of very poor quality when literally everybody has what it takes to live on better foodstuffs?Karim AkermaHamburg, Germany Please send letters to weekly.letters@theguardian.com", "sentences": ["That contemporary cats are lovable may of course have developed as the article avers \u2013 but as a byproduct.Dave SchmalzAmsterdam, the Netherlands There is more danger now Since this year marks the 100th anniversary of the horrors of the first world war, aversion to war should be high."], "title": "Guardian Weekly Letters, 19 December 2014", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/dec/16/weekly-letter-christmas-nhs-cats-war-food", "tags": []}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-16T14:30:00Z", "article": "Few business ideas are trending so widely right now as the sharing economy \u2013 the term for a new breed of peer-to-peer services and collaborative consumption models with the potential to disrupt the status quo. Last week saw the publication of an independent review (pdf) aimed at \u201cunlocking\u201d the sharing economy. We ask author Debbie Wosskow, founder of home exchange club Love Home Swap, to select her top 10 recommendations. Here they are. 1. Industry representation Sharing economy entrepreneurs should join together to form a trade body, Wosskow insists. Such an association would play three primary roles: provide a single voice to government, attract inward investment, and boost the collective buying power of its members. Wosskow would also like to see such a trade body issuing a kitemark system to ensure sharing economy businesses are meeting professional standards. \u201cThat way, consumers who are looking at joining the sharing economy can get comfortable with the kind of platform they might use\u201d, she says. 2. Insuring the risks According to background research commissioned as part of Wosskow\u2019s review, 80% of people pinpoint worries about insurance as the biggest barrier to engaging in the sharing economy. Accessing insurance is problematic for many sharing economy firms, especially the smaller ones, so Wosskow suggests that firms negotiate insurance coverage jointly, ideally via her proposed trade association. She also points companies to a new guide on insurance and the sharing economy, produced by the British Insurance Brokers\u2019 Association and released in tandem with Wosskow\u2019s report. 3. Making tax easier Another major barrier in the uptake of sharing economy businesses is the confusion around tax. It\u2019s a question of clarifying existing rules, not setting new ones, Wosskow argues. Ideally HM Revenue and Customs and HM Treasury should create a guide to tax in the sharing economy, she says. Also of benefit would be an online tax calculator to help users of sharing economy services to easily work out their tax liabilities. 4. Fair market access The UK government should set clear minimum standards for health and safety, including fire safety, for all providers of accommodation. \u201cRegardless of whether they have been part of the traditional B&amp;B market for years or if they are part of the sharing economy, everyone should be treated in the same way\u201d, she insists. Such a measure should help address a perceived bias against small hoteliers and other hospitality providers who feel they face tougher health and safety requirements than sharing-based platforms such as Airbnb. 5. Size matters Regulations for those providing accommodation should be proportionate to the scale of operation, continues Wosskow: \u201cThere is a clear difference between someone who is renting out a spare room for a couple of nights a year and a business that is renting out hundreds of homes all year round.\u201d It\u2019s unfair that these two radically different sized businesses should be subject to the same regulations, she says. This doesn\u2019t contradict her call for minimum standards on health and safety standards. Instead she envisions a sliding scale, with smaller players treated less onerously. 6. Living wage Skill-sharing platforms should ensure that workers are paid at least a living wage, currently set at \u00a37.85 per hour in the UK. This would comprise one of the base compliance measures for Wosskow\u2019s proposed Kitemark. \u201cThere\u2019s a responsibility [on the part of sharing economy businesses] to ensure that we\u2019re protecting workers through these new ways of doing business\u201d, she says, \u201cbut also consumers want to be aware that workers are being paid properly and not exploited.\u201d 7. Time banks Wosskow argues that government departments should embrace time banks as a way to give their staff volunteering opportunities, as well as providing civil servants with a novel means of training and personal development. She also believes that JobCentre staff should be given clear guidance on how to promote time banking and task-sharing platforms too. 8. Integrated transport Government departments need to lead by example when it comes to sharing-related transport solutions, insists Wosskow. At present, rules governing public sector authorities prevent them from considering solutions such as car sharing and ride sharing while on official business. That needs to change. In addition, the UK government and regional transport authorities should integrate car clubs into public sector transport systems, she adds. 9. Ridesharing profits At present, rules prevent car drivers involved in ride sharing from charging a fee. \u201cIf you are driving to Glastonbury and you take four people with you, you ought to be able to make some money from that\u201d, Wosskow maintains. The recommendation comes with several caveats. First, that the drivers undergo appropriate safeguarding checks. Second, that taking passengers isn\u2019t the primary reason for the driver journey. 10. Sharing city pilot Of all Wosskow\u2019s recommendations, the one that has stirred up most public discussion is the idea of a sharing city pilot. The idea is to showcase the joining up of transport, shared office space, accommodation and skills networks in one place. She cites similar experiments in Seoul and Amsterdam, among others. Wosskow refuses to be drawn on her preferred location, although she does concede it should be \u201csomewhere outside London\u201d.

These Japanese macaques, or snow monkeys, live in the mountains of Jigokudani Yean-Koen. In the early 1960s, a lady who ran one of the spa resorts spotted some and started feeding them \u2013 she felt sorry for them out in the harsh winter. A group started coming down from the mountains every day to bathe and stay warm. It wasn\u2019t hygienic for visitors, so eventually a separate pool was built just for the monkeys. It\u2019s not a zoo \u2013 they are still wild animals, but people come by the busload to watch them. And they all want to take the same picture \u2013 the monkeys with their heads popping out of the water. I wanted to show them in a completely different way. Over the last few years, I\u2019ve spent a month and a half photographing them. The pool is in the Japanese alpine region, in a valley called Jigokudani, which translates as Hell\u2019s Valley. It\u2019s named that because of the area\u2019s volcanic activity. There\u2019s no sunshine, the only light is the reflection of the snow on the mountains and you can smell the sulphur coming up from the thermal spas. Every time I\u2019m out in the field I ask myself what it is about a place that makes me smile or makes me cry. Here, I wanted to emphasise that mystical quality. This photo was taken during a blizzard that had come on suddenly. The fog (caused by the temperature difference between the hot water and freezing air) started swirling around the water. This happens a few times a week. The bottom of the pool is black so the water surface looks dark. The conditions were perfect \u2013 but there was no monkey. There are usually about 30 animals in the water all at once, but that day there were none. So I waited. Suddenly, one jumped up on to this rock and started shaking himself to get the snow off his back. This particular rock had been my nemesis the whole time I had been there. It\u2019s so oddly shaped, almost a square, it doesn\u2019t look natural, and it always seemed to be in the background. But when he jumped on it, that all changed. Combined with the fog, the blizzard and the black water, it suddenly became a monkey floating through the galaxy on a magic carpet. That\u2019s the mythical quality I was hoping for. Macaques communicate a lot through facial expressions. They really show their characters with their eyes and teeth. They are usually very relaxed when they shake their fur so this is his calm, zen face.  You can\u2019t control nature photography; you\u2019re a guest in a habitat. Things will never happen the way you expect them to. That means there are very high highlights but very low low points, like when the weather takes over and you are soaked to the bone waiting around for something to happen. But you have to deal with the lows to get highs like this. And it feels so pure when you get to see the world as if it has never been touched by man. CV Born: Vlaardingen, The Netherlands, 1979.

But when I mentioned this glorious innovation to my wife, she replied: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with asking someone else to take your picture?\u201d Oh. Oh yeah. Asking someone to take your picture. It\u2019s sort of a nice, shy way of interacting with your fellow human beings. I\u2019d forgotten about that. Fifteen years ago, a book called Bowling Alone by Robert D Putnam analysed the breakdown in community in America, based on the chilling phenomenon of going bowling on your own. Maybe Putnam will write a sequel: Selfie Stick Society. Vermintrusion   A very unwelcome visitor has appeared in our house. A mouse. And you would be amazed at how very unlike any episode of Tom and Jerry this situation is. The mouse itself is not an adorable little character, but a tiny, shifty, nasty, objectionable little figure to be seen scuttling across the kitchen floor. You have to make an effort of will to treat its presence with ironically bemused hilarity \u2013 rather than the hysterical fear and disgust that comes naturally. At a local shop I bought four mousetraps: two of the \u201ccompassionate\u201d kind which (supposedly) capture the mice without harming them; and two of the old-fashioned nasty snapping kind, which might actually get the job done. We have also got a specialist to lay down poison. Like Captain Ahab, I am brooding about my prey. Perhaps it will just leave of its own accord.

That\u2019s right: coffee with butter in it. Milk in coffee is apparently passe. The coming thing is sticking a baby-fist-sized gob of Yeo Valley butter in your coffee, along with a generous dollop of something called MCT oil. Or possibly coconut oil will do. Tragically eager to be up with all the latest things, I tried it in a specialist hipster coffee shop in London: it\u2019s called \u201cbulletproof\u201d coffee, which is ironic because drinking it felt like being shot. Sipping my buttery drink I sort of felt like one of the people in Evelyn Waugh\u2019s Vile Bodies wearing black suede shoes with tuxedos, the bogus fashion mischievously proclaimed in the Mr Chatterbox gossip column. Or rather one of the very few people wearing bottle-green bowler hats \u2013 the subsequent hoax trend in Waugh\u2019s satire that fails to convince and earns its author the sack.

The Copenhagen-born, Berlin-based artist, known for his enormous, immersive installations \u2013 he once installed a gigantic, glowing sun at Tate Modern \u2013 included simple instructions: residents of the crumbling Albanian capital, which was recovering from the end of communist rule in 1990, were to construct their visions for the city\u2019s future out of Lego. \u201cBuilding a stable society,\u201d Eliasson said, \u201cis only possible with the involvement and co-operation of each individual.\u201d As the days passed, everyone from kids to adults, passers-by to committed users, gradually turned the plastic rubble into a glistening white Lego metropolis. Part art installation, part crowdsourced sculpture, part urban intervention, the success of the Collectivity Project was a sign, perhaps, of our desire to become more involved in imagining the possibilities for our cities, even if our bricks-and-plastic creations will eventually be taken apart and packed up in a box. But it also signals the Lego Group\u2019s desire for its products to be thought of as more than a child\u2019s building blocks. In little more than a decade, the Danish company has gone from a $300m loss to overtake Mattel, the makers of Barbie, as the world\u2019s largest toy-maker. It has achieved this through a canny mixture of movie franchising (The Hobbit, Star Wars, Harry Potter and, of course, The Lego Movie), an ever-expanding universe of video games (including Lego City for Nintendo) and even a forthcoming CBeebies TV show in 2016 based on its long-running Lego City line \u2013 featuring sets such as Lego City Museum Break-In and Lego City Prisoner Transport.     MIT CityScope: Beta testers use CityScope to explore the feasibility of placing new buildings in Kendall Square (Cambridge, Massachusetts). Photograph: MIT Media Lab    But Lego has also made an effort for the bricks to travel from the playroom to the boardroom, with the company appealing to artists, architects and other creative professionals to use their product as the building blocks for innovation. The Lego City video game may be just that, a game; but the company also donated 1m bricks to Dutch architect Winy Maas, who created 676 scale-model skyscrapers for the 2012 Venice Biennale. (They also gave Eliasson those three tonnes of bricks.) This October, the Lego Group held a workshop in Copenhagen, ahead of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that tasked close to 700 children with building ideas for a sustainable future out of their products. Then there\u2019s the recently released Lego Architecture Studio, a \u00a3149 instruction-free kit of white blocks that lets AFOLs (adult fans of Lego) play Frank Gehry and create their own architectural masterpieces. Lego even sponsors an urban planning project at MIT in the hopes that city planners, like architects before them, might use the bricks as tools to solve issues such as transportation and walkability. It\u2019s at this point that one could be forgiven for raising an eyebrow. Urban areas are bigger, denser, more complex and more reliant on technology than ever before. Can this most analogue of toys \u2013 dreamed up by an entrepreneurial carpenter in Billund in 1932 \u2013 really teach us how to build better cities? Or is this just a smart extension of the Lego brand, to persuade well-heeled parents that an expensive Lego City Monster Truck is a serious educational toy? Surely urban planners themselves, laden with degrees and sophisticated insights into the ebb and flow of urban life, aren\u2019t actually plotting our cities using Lego City Train Station? The answer might be found in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where MIT\u2019s CityScope has created what managing director Ryan Chin calls an \u201curban observatory\u201d. It\u2019s a 30x60in Lego model of the city\u2019s Kendall Square, on to which research scientists project digital data. For example, geolocated Twitter feeds from people working and studying in the real Kendall Square are mapped on to buildings; traffic information is projected on the brick roads. The idea, explains Chin, is to get a sense of how people live and work in the city. \u201cWe can look at flows of traffic, goods and people, and flows of energy,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat are the passive solar gains on a building? What are the shadows cast from a building on to a roadway?\u201d Details about household sizes, population numbers and walkability can be programmed to provide, as he puts it, \u201ca finely grained geospatial view of where things are happening in cities\u201d. In fact, software like this already exists: Autodesk or Esri CityEngine allow planners to map all kinds of data on to virtual 3D models of buildings and cities. Urban areas are intricate, shapeshifting ecosystems that presumably can\u2019t be clicked together in an afternoon. Common sense suggests that a plastic city is too pixellated and limited to help planners design resilient cities that can adapt to climate change or find solutions to demographic changes and land use. Chin argues, however, that it is precisely a lack of refinement that makes Lego useful as a design tool. He\u2019s a fan of the malleability, interactivity and three-dimensional properties of the Lego model at CityScope. A former architect who has worked in automobile design, Chin sees flaws in traditional photorealistic renderings, which are often \u201cPhotoshopped to death\u201d, he says. \u201cYou can hire the best photographer to make a house look beautiful, and you can hire the best 3D-renderers to make a model look beautiful.\u201d     MIT Media Lab\u2019s CityScope merges tangible models with digital information    Lego, on the other hand, he describes as \u201cpre-architecture\u201d. The featureless bricks represent a city in progress, rather than a finished metropolis. By relocating a Lego office tower a few streets over or, say, widening a Lego road, they can instantly test the consequences of planning ideas. The addition of a sports stadium may affect the location of a bus stop or subway station; moving building X in front of building Y may disrupt traffic. Virtual reality technology such as Google Glass offers visualisations but not the same group interactivity, he says. And while 3D printing, touted as the future of design, could eventually offer both the interactivity and benefits of rapid prototyping, it is still out of reach: a resin maquette of San Francisco made earlier this year took two months to construct, cost $20,000 and you can\u2019t move the Golden Gate Bridge. But outside the lab, are any urban planners actually sitting around their offices with piles of blocks? Just as it is hard to imagine Zaha Hadid whipping out a Lego set when dreaming up her Dongdaemun Design Plaza for Seoul, it\u2019s difficult to picture planners in London or Paris or Tokyo sitting crosslegged on the floor, mapping out a new business district from plastic plates, tiles and minifigs. This is where you suspect it could all be a clever move on the part of Lego: an extension of the brand that fits perfectly with how a company devoted to the concept of constructivist play wants itself to be seen. \u201cOne of Lego\u2019s strengths is its impermanence,\u201d says Paul Bailey of the London brand consultancy 1977 Design. \u201cIt\u2019s being used in things like urban planning because, at its core, Lego is about building and innovation. It was never about making toys that looked exactly like a spaceship.\u201d A partnership with a group like MIT strengthens that image of innovation and creativity, and reconnects the company to its original identity, back in the days before the film franchising and the brand partnerships. \u201cI think what Lego is potentially doing here is reiterate, \u2018We are a creative platform.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s that accessibility that gives Lego a bit of credibility in urban planning. Chin at MIT admits the blocks are most valuable to use in participatory design, rather than for their technical specifications. The CityScope team was just hired to create an interactive Lego model for a new transit system in Boston, designed to show residents and other stakeholders how the new transit will affect their community, such as its impact on commuting time and land value.     The completed city created in Olafur Eliasson\u2019s The Collectivity Project in 2005 in Tirana, Albania. Photograph: Olafur Eliasson    Other planners have also used Lego to bring regular people into the planning process. Earlier this year, a workshop in London used the Lego Architecture Studio kits to get participants aged four to 84 to create a city from scratch. \u201cIt was a fascinating exercise,\u201d says Finn Williams, who led the event. \u201cOver six hours you could almost see the classic stages of the evolution of a city.\u201d Williams, an instructor at the Royal College of Art\u2019s School of Architecture and a self-confessed \u201cLego fundamentalist\u201d \u2013 he jokes that he took the Lego consultant gig because they paid him in bricks \u2013 started his career working for architects such as Rem Koolhaas, but switched to planning because he saw an opportunity to influence not only buildings but neighbourhoods. \u201cI felt like there was something going wrong in the system before architects picked up a commission,\u201d he says. \u201cThe wrong questions were being asked in briefs.\u201d Part of the solution to poor planning decisions, he explains, is to involve the people who will be affected. Lego is just one piece of the puzzle \u2013 or brick in the wall \u2013 but he believes it allows local residents to see first-hand the implications of design decisions. \u201cNot many mediums allow people to engage on level platforms in such an engaging and satisfying way.\u201d He is a fan of Eliasson\u2019s Connectivity Project for that very reason: \u201cWhere Lego is most successful in urbanism is when is starts a conversation about the bigger issues of planning.\u201d In this sense, it doesn\u2019t matter that Lego can\u2019t accurately model cities. The professional \u201cLego builder\u201d Warren Elsmore, who organised the Brick 2014 Lego conference in London last month and has created everything from St Pancras Station to Amsterdam canal houses, told me the realism of his models relies on the same kinds of tromp l\u2019oeil effects you see in the castles at Disneyland.  Indeed, there is something uncanny about the way Lego can mirror our real cities. At his workshop in London, Williams gave the participants a few rules, a level playing field and then set them loose to create their cities from scratch. Yet a pattern quickly emerged. \u201cThere were large, flat Lego baseplates that immediately took up all the space in the city and left no public realm,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe swiftly had to remove all these big plates so people would be forced to think about their building in relation to the other people\u2019s, instead of building as much as they possibly could.\u201d Eventually, the participants began to demolish structures that didn\u2019t fit the emerging cityscape. They had faced the same perils, possibilities and problems in their Lego city as they might if working on a real one.", "sentences": ["The professional \u201cLego builder\u201d Warren Elsmore, who organised the Brick 2014 Lego conference in London last month and has created everything from St Pancras Station to Amsterdam canal houses, told me the realism of his models relies on the same kinds of tromp l\u2019oeil effects you see in the castles at Disneyland."], "title": "Lego: can this most analogue of toys really be a modern urban planning tool?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/18/lego-toys-urban-planning-tool-architects-mit", "tags": ["Cities", "Art and design", "Design", "MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Lego", "Toys", "Life and style", "Culture", "Education"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-19T10:03:03Z", "article": "Paul Baggaley Publisher, Picador The book that made my year: The commercial publication of Picador\u2019s year was The Miniaturist by Jessie Burton, which has just been crowned Waterstones book of the year and was a Sunday Times No 1 bestseller. It is a magical novel that effortlessly transports the reader to 17th-century Amsterdam, in a story of obsession, love and betrayal. We also launched first novels in the UK by two brilliant and very different writers: Emily St John Mandel, with Station Eleven, her remarkable post-apocalyptic paean to the civilising effect of art, and Zia Haider Rahman, whose In the Light of What We Know may be the most ambitious and thought-provoking novel of the year, touching on the great financial, military and migratory upheavals of our century through a story of friendship, maths and philosophy.          Our book that deserved to do better: We published a first novel, Life Drawing, by Robin Black, that united its readers in awe and admiration. I believe it is a masterpiece \u2013 a novel about two creative spirits whose narrator, Gus, is one of the most arresting women in recent fiction. Claire Messud\u2019s review in this paper perhaps explains why it hasn\u2019t yet broken out: \u201cIt is at once quiet and memorable. This makes it far from fashionable, and all the more to be applauded.\u201d I wish I\u2019d published: I was overwhelmed by Cynan Jones\u2019s The Dig, a novel that somehow transforms the unlikely raw material of badger-baiting and the death of a spouse into a shocking, brutal yet poetic novel. I then went back to his first novel, The Long Dry, a beautiful, melancholic meditation on farming life. To me this is the first fictional nature writing to match the qualities of its much lauded non-fiction counterparts. Richard Beswick MD, Little, Brown and Abacus The book that made my year: The resurgence of Jane Gardam\u2019s books has given me as much pleasure as anything this year. Last Friends, the final book in her brilliant trilogy which began with Old Filth, was shortlisted for the Folio prize and her Collected Stories was rightly showered with praise. Our book that deserved to do better: Gabrielle Zevin\u2019s The Storied Life of AJ Fikry has been a huge success in hardback everywhere in the world apart from the UK. We are hoping our spring paperback publication will awaken British readers to its immense charm. I wish I\u2019d published: I thought Michel Faber\u2019s The Book of Strange New Things was superb. It took familiar tropes from dystopian fiction and did something adventurous and imaginative with them (not least the creation of lovable, yet distinctly unlovely, aliens) to create a serious, morally questioning novel about our attitudes to the \u201cother\u201d. One for Nigel Farage\u2019s Christmas stocking?          Lee Brackstone Creative director, Faber The book that made my year: Over the last few years there has been a definite shift in publishing towards making books beautiful again. Two months ago we published So this Is Permanence, the lyrics and notebooks of Ian Curtis, a beautifully and lovingly assembled book put together with the help of his band, Joy Division, Jon Savage and Ian\u2019s widow, Deborah Curtis. The book frames Ian\u2019s handwritten lyrics \u2013 which remain some of the most powerful in the rock\u2019n\u2019roll canon \u2013 as a literary journey, with a visual appendix presenting the books that survived from Ian\u2019s library: Kafka, Eliot, Ballard, Burroughs. Our book that deserved to do better: William Atkins\u2019s The Moor was written about by Blake Morrison in this paper as Review\u2019s book of the week. It records a journey taken across England\u2019s moors from Bodmin and Dartmoor to North Yorkshire and Northumberland. It is a literary history of the moors (Conan Doyle, Ted Hughes etc) but also a magnificent piece of landscape writing. Big success for the book remains tantalisingly out of reach: perhaps the paperback will connect with readers who love writers like Robert Macfarlane and books such as H Is for Hawk. I wish I\u2019d published: The standout book for me this year was published by an enterprising crowd-funded publisher called Unbound. Paul Kingsnorth\u2019s The Wake is written in a shadow tongue of Anglo-Saxon and it gatecrashed the Man Booker prize longlist and won the Gordon Burn prize. The prose is mesmerising, incantatory. The antihero at the heart of the book \u2013 a delusional paranoid rebel called Buccmaster \u2013 is a compelling, awful yet noble, and sometimes comic creation. It is a novel that says as much about the Age of Farage as it does about the 11th-century Norman conquest. Jamie Byng Publisher, Canongate The book that made my year: One of the most rewarding publishing relationships I have had, and will ever have, is with Michel Faber. It began in 1997, and working with this highly original and brilliant writer and his beloved wife, Eva, has been illuminating, surprising and a huge privilege. And so publishing The Book of Strange New Things, his magnificent new novel, has meant more to me than any other book I\u2019ve been involved in this year. Eva\u2019s death this summer only added to the intensity of the experience. Our book that deserved to do better: If I had to pick out one it would be Russell Brand and Chris Riddell\u2019s Trickster Tales: The Pied Piper of Hamelin. It is a stunning book that has yet to be fully appreciated. I wish I\u2019d published: Three that stick out are Atul Gawande\u2019s Being Mortal, Helen Macdonald\u2019s H Is for Hawk and the anthology Poems that Make Grown Men Cry that Anthony and Ben Holden edited together. They are all accessible and moving. And all three were published with great conviction and skill. Andrew Franklin Publisher, Profile Books The book that made my year: The book I\u2019m most proud to have published this year is Atul Gawande\u2019s Being Mortal. Not many books change how we think about something important, but this one does: it revolutionises our thinking around death and dying. It has already started a long overdue conversation about what really matters at the end of life, a subject that has proved so tough to confront. That Gawande gave this year\u2019s BBC Reith lectures is testament to his compassion and clear-sightedness when it comes to medicine and how it should be used to improve our lives. His Checklist Manifesto transformed surgery, lowering death rates and improving recovery rates, and I am certain that Being Mortal will be as significant in changing how we care for the dying.     Atul Gawande. Photograph: Alamy    Our book that deserved to do better: Andrew Martin is a wry, witty and authoritative social historian and an accomplished novelist. His latest book Belles &amp; Whistles: Five Journeys Through Time on Britain\u2019s Trains should be read by every railway-operator boss and disgruntled commuter as a reminder of how great and glamorous British rail travel used to be. And if you are stuck waiting for the signal failure to be sorted out or for a platform to become free, the book has the great virtue of being funny, entertaining, amusing and just a little nostalgic. The book I am most proud NOT to have published (and most ashamed for my fellow publishers for signing up): Girl Online by Zoe Sugg. The great Penguin Books has an unhappy history of publishing cringeworthy books. Remember Diana\u2019s butler Paul Burrell\u2019s A Royal Duty? Then there was Pippa Middleton\u2019s Celebrate. And now there\u2019s Zoella\u2019s ghost-written confection, cobbled together from her dispiriting blog and her superficial life spent shopping and stressing about makeup. When there are so many great YA books and writers, it is horrible that such effort should be put into churning out an offshoot of a blog that is essentially about \u2026 nothing. Adam Freudenheim Publisher and MD, Pushkin Press The books that made my year: The Brethren by Robert Merle is the first volume in a bawdy and swashbuckling historical fiction series set in 16th-century France which has been described as \u201cGame of Thrones meets The Three Musketeers\u201d. I\u2019m thrilled that The Brethren had such a good reception from critics and readers alike: volume two is out next summer. On our children\u2019s list, The Letter for the King by Tonke Dragt, a thrilling and adventure-filled classic quest novel, continues to capture the imagination of readers young and old more than 50 years after its first publication in Dutch. Our book that deserved to do better: Peter Fr\u00f6berg Idling\u2019s poetic and political thriller Song for an Approaching Storm, set in 1950s Cambodia and describing a (real-life) love triangle that involved Miss Cambodia, the deputy prime minister and the future Pol Pot as a young man. Beautifully written (and beautifully translated by Peter Graves), it\u2019s an accomplished debut that puts you in the heads and hearts of these three characters and provides great insight into the recent history of this troubled country. I wish I\u2019d published: Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan Novels. I\u2019ve been recommending these to everyone I know since I read the first book, My Brilliant Friend, at the beginning of 2014. When the third book came out in September I had to put aside all submissions for a few days to continue the saga. These feminist novels are the best modern portrait of a female friendship I\u2019ve come across in literature. I\u2019m impatient for the fourth and final book which is out in autumn 2015. John Mitchinson Co-founder &amp; Publisher, Unbound The books that made my year: Paul Kingsnorth\u2019s The Wake, and Shaun Usher\u2019s Letters of Note. Between them, these two books \u2013 beautiful, brave and challenging in different ways \u2013 have made crowdfunding feel not just legitimate but unstoppable.          Our book that deserved to do better: Simon Napier-Bell\u2019s Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay, which honestly should be by the bedside of every one who wants to do more than just listen to music. Beautifully written, it wears its considerable scholarship well. I wish I\u2019d published: Two books stand out: Meadowland by John Lewis-Stempel because it made me fall back in love with my own soggy, nettle-choked field; Richard Ford\u2019s Let Me Be Frank With You, because he is a true master and they are rarer than flower meadows. Nicholas Pearson Publishing director, 4th Estate The book that made my year: Lena Dunham\u2019s memoir, Not That Kind of Girl, was much anticipated and didn\u2019t disappoint \u2013 the book itself, the critical reaction and its sales all met expectations. Compressing her publicity schedule into three days is just the sort of crazy challenge we love. Our book that deserved to do better: Many read Joseph O\u2019Neill\u2019s Netherland a few years back, but not enough have read his new one, The Dog. Modern life, with its spawning anxieties, has rarely been picked apart so brilliantly. I wish I\u2019d published: Karen McCarthy Woolf\u2019s collection of poems An Aviary of Small Birds, her elegy to a stillborn son; Marius Szczygiel\u2019s Gottland, non-fiction stories from Czechoslovakia, which show a country more fantastical than even its wildest literature led us to believe; and I\u2019ve just started Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s Nora Webster \u2013 superb. Thomas Penn Editorial director, Penguin The book that made my year: It is neck-and-neck between two brave, brilliant books that in their different ways are having an explosive impact on public debate: Flash Boys, Michael Lewis\u2019s white-knuckle expos\u00e9 of high\u2011frequency trading; and Owen Jones\u2019s searing, eye-opening The Establishment: And How They Get Away With It.     French economist and academic Thomas Piketty. Photograph: Reuters    Our book that deserved to do better: Eduardo Galeano is a visionary genius, and reviews of his magical Children of the Days: A Calendar of Human History placed him, rightly, in the same bracket as fellow Latin American fiction writers such as Borges, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Bola\u00f1o. Despite this, he remains largely undiscovered to British readers. I wish I\u2019d published: French economist Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital in the Twenty-First Century, a monumental \u2013 and beautifully translated \u2013 work of epic scope and rich, rigorous detail that explores, and explains, how the rich are getting richer and the poor, poorer. Alexandra Pringle Editor in chief, Bloomsbury The book that made my year: Publishing Richard Ford is a joy, an honour and a privilege. There are very few living masters of fiction \u2013 he is one of them. And for those of us who grew up and are growing old with Frank Bascombe, to have his ruminatory, mordant, charming, mercurial voice in our ears again is an utter pleasure. Let Me Be Frank With You, the fourth in the Bascombe series, is pitch perfect. Our book that deserved to do better: Esther Freud is one of Britain\u2019s finest writers and in Mr Mac and Me we have her major work. It received fabulous reviews, it has sold beautifully. But it didn\u2019t make the Booker or the Costa lists. Freud is the subtlest of artists. I remember that when Hideous Kinky was published, Gabriele Annan in the TLS said she has \u201cthe art that conceals art\u201d. So perfectly concealed is her art that year after year the prizes ignore her. She is easily as important a writer as Penelope Fitzgerald, whom the world is scrambling over to applaud \u2013 after her death \u2013 in the light of Hermione Lee\u2019s biography. Why can\u2019t we do this with our major women writers while they are alive? Had Ishiguro, McEwan or T\u00f3ib\u00edn written Mr Mac and Me it would have been a different story.          I wish I\u2019d published: Honey &amp; Co: Food from the Middle East by Itamar Srulovich and Sarit Packer, because I love their restaurant that is like a Middle Eastern home, I love their food which is heaven on Earth, and most of all I love Itamar and Sarit. If I could, I would be married to both of them. Simon Prosser Publisher, Hamish Hamilton The book that made my year: Ali Smith\u2019s joyfully inventive How to Be Both \u2013 a gift of a novel which drew on her many strengths as a writer and then added something even more powerful and new. I still don\u2019t know how Smith does it; she writes with an intuition that is thrillingly unique. Our book that deserved to do better: Eliza Granville\u2019s highly original Gretel and the Dark \u2013 a dark intertwining of two apparently unrelated stories, set in fin-de-siecle Vienna and 1940s Germany, and inspired by the appropriation of Grimms\u2019 fairytales in Nazi propaganda. I wish I\u2019d published: The new Knausgaard, Boyhood Island, of course. One of the most interesting and addictive writers alive, he has the uncanny effect (on me at least) of unlocking memories, bringing the reader\u2019s past back into view alongside his own. Sigrid Rausing Publisher, Granta &amp; Portobello The book that made my year: This year is the anniversary both of the beginning of the first world war and of the fall of the Berlin wall, so perhaps it is appropriate that my books of the year are about the bleak era between these two events. A Brief Stop on the Road from Auschwitz is Swedish journalist G\u00f6ran Rosenberg\u2019s tender and measured memoir addressed to his father, a Holocaust survivor. The Impossible Exile: Stefan Zweig at the End of the World by George Prochnik is an intensely poignant account of Zweig\u2019s exile and, in the end, suicide. Our book that deserved to do better: Our debut novel Dust by Kenyan writer Yvonne Ahiambo Owuor is a beautifully written state-of-the-nation novel about her homeland, and how the violence of the past \u2013 colonial and post-colonial \u2013 haunts the present, and particularly the election of 2007. I wish I\u2019d published: I was fascinated by Siri Hustvedt\u2019s novel The Blazing World \u2013 a dense psychoanalytic exploration of a woman artist, who was married to a once highly successful, now deceased, art dealer. It is about female submission, silence and rage, but it\u2019s also an ironic and playful narrative about the New York art scene. Robin Robertson Deputy publishing director, Jonathan Cape The book that made my year: I was pleased to see John Burnside reaffirming his position in the front rank of British poetry with his new collection All One Breath, but dismayed that I Put a Spell on You, his thrilling, disquieting book of memoir and \u201cdigressions on love and glamour\u201d, didn\u2019t sell in serious quantities. I can think of no other writer who moves as freely, and brilliantly, through the forms: the novel, the essay, the story and the poem. Our book that deserved to do better: It was a grim year for literary publishing. Both Adam Foulds\u2019s magisterial In the Wolf\u2019s Mouth and Elizabeth McCracken\u2019s effervescent stories, Thunderstruck, deserved more readers, but the one that really got away was Other People\u2019s Countries by Patrick McGuinness: a gloriously sui generis book about childhood, place and memory that manages to be profound, moving and very funny, sometimes in the same sentence. I wish I\u2019d published: John Berryman\u2019s complete Dream Songs, with a new introduction from Michael Hofmann, and The Heart Is Strange: New Selected Poems, introduced by Daniel Swift, have both just come out from Farrar, Straus and Giroux as part of a programme to mark the centenary of the birth of this great and greatly troubled poet. Puzzlingly, it seems that Berryman\u2019s UK publishers are not following suit.", "sentences": ["It is a magical novel that effortlessly transports the reader to 17th-century Amsterdam, in a story of obsession, love and betrayal."], "title": "The publisher\u2019s year: hits and misses of 2014", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/19/the-publishers-year-hits-and-misses-of-2014", "tags": ["Publishing", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Biography"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-21T09:00:11Z", "article": "You can not only find someone online willing to rent you a room in their house, but someone who will share their car, their desk, their power tools, their child\u2019s toys. You can find someone to walk your dog, deliver your dinner, assemble your furniture, lend you clothes or hold your place in a queue for the latest iPhone. This is the \u201csharing economy\u201d, hailed by the government for creating \u201cmicro-entrepreneurs\u201d and by economists for putting \u201cexcess capacity\u201d to use. Traditional businesses and workers \u2013 from hotel owners to taxi drivers \u2013 have been less welcoming.  The sector is growing fast. Airbnb claims to have more than 1m rooms available, compared with the 13m rooms provided by formal hotel chains (not including bed and breakfast rooms). Uber can claim thousands of drivers \u2013 some poached from other lift services, or working for more than one. Not all companies are doing so well: TaskRabbit, which puts you in touch with vetted \u201ctaskers\u201d to take whatever chore you want off your hands, has struggled to grow beyond its current 19 cities, which include London. As poster children for the sharing economy (even if Uber shrugs off the title), both Uber and Airbnb have been accused of riding roughshod over the regulations other companies have to play by. The list of places where Uber has been banned now runs to Berlin (and later Germany), the state of Virginia, New Delhi, Belgium, the state of New South Wales in Australia, Spain, Portland in Oregon (it went ahead anyway), Thailand and Seoul in South Korea. A number of those bans were later lifted. The ride-hailing service, started by Travis Kalanick after he found he couldn\u2019t use his smartphone to hail a cab in Paris, has been the lightning rod for much of the anger at the disruption being caused by these new companies. In a number of cities, including London and Paris, taxi drivers have protested at the presence of the firm, claiming its avoidance of many regulations enables it to undercut them on price; in other cities, Uber \u201cdrivers\u201d \u2013 the company insists they are not its employees \u2013 have protested too. Meanwhile Airbnb, started by two designers who in 2008 hosted three people looking for a temporary place to stay, has had a series of run-ins with US regulators. New York state in particular has taken the company to task over whether its activity constitutes sub-letting, thus breaking the leases of many residents who offered rooms or homes. In April 2014, New York state authorities found that two-thirds of the apartments being offered there broke the law in that way. In Amsterdam last week the company agreed to collect potentially millions of euros in tourist taxes after complaints from hoteliers. But for Patrick Robinson, Airbnb\u2019s public policy director in Europe, there\u2019s no question its users should enjoy lighter regulation than some other businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s manifestly obvious to me that somebody renting out their flat shouldn\u2019t have to obey the same rules as a Park Lane hotel,\u201d he says. His views were echoed by a government-commissioned report in November that recommended \u201c[existing] regulations must be examined to ensure they are still fit for purpose and meet peoples\u2019 expectations \u2013 particularly for accommodation and task-sharing platforms\u201d. The recommendation was that regulations should change, but only for those small groups \u2013 and the government seems broadly sympathetic: in a foreword to the report, the Tory business minister Matthew Hancock said that new services such as Airbnb and PeoplePerHour \u201care unlocking a new generation of micro-entrepreneurs\u201d. The report itself was written by Debbie Wosskow, who runs Love Home Swap, described as a \u201cpeer-to-peer travel club\u201d. That fact itself irked the British Hospitality Association, whose members view many \u201csharing economy\u201d participants as enjoying a free ride, with no oversight apart from the cumulative reviews on the site itself. By contrast, hotels and B&amp;Bs, the BHA\u2019s members, face constant scrutiny. The court cases hoteliers have faced in recent years over whether they can turn away would-be clients are in stark contrast to the laissez-faire approach of internet-based rivals which are free to reject anyone, risking nothing worse than damaging their online reputation, which may affect future bookings. The key that has enabled all this is the internet and smartphones: as commerce moves online and the internet pervades so many areas of life, it has become easier to create businesses linking people who want to be on either side of a deal. In effect, it seems every transaction can be managed by a sort of dating site. A classical economist would argue that these systems are releasing surplus capacity into the economy: there are car seats going begging on various journeys that could be more efficiently shared, and the exchange of value (read: payment) between participants would be good for all. It should increase efficiency and lower the price of those goods; so you might expect that the arrival of ride-sharing services would drive down prices for existing, regulated services. There are signs that this is happening in some areas. In New York the cost of a \u201cmedallion\u201d for an official yellow cab has fallen from its million-dollar peak recently. But both Robinson and the BHA say there\u2019s no sign that Airbnb is pushing down the price of hotels, or official bed and breakfast accommodation. Tony Greenham, head of finance and business at the New Economics Foundation, cautions that in many cases the label of the \u201csharing economy\u201d is a fig leaf for companies that are just as rapacious as any around now. \u201cThe starting point has to be realising that the label has been used to describe wildly different things. At one end there\u2019s Uber, which is trying to dress a traditionally capitalist business model in the cuddly clothes of \u2018sharing\u2019. But that doesn\u2019t mean the whole area is just marketing.\u201d There are also potential downsides, or what economists call \u201cexternalities\u201d. Greenham says: \u201cDriving down the cost of taxis encourages people off buses and into taxis. That means you\u2019re actually using more resources, at an overall higher cost to everyone because you have all these people owning and running cars.\u201d He also points to the fact that every driver (and every passenger) is rated by each other; if a driver\u2019s rating falls too far below 5/5, they are liable to be dropped. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to question whether these services make the relationship between people more or less uneven,\u201d Greenham cautions. \u201cUber has all the power in this relationship. It reminds me of nothing so much as longshoremen turning up at docks a century ago hoping to be hired by the foreman \u2013 the sort of situation that led to the formation of unions.\u201d With accommodation services, there are other immediate concerns: Jackie Grech, legal and policy director at the British Hospitality Association, cites loud parties disturbing neighbours, even premises being used as brothels. For Airbnb, Robinson argues the company has brought benefits through the hiring of cleaners for accommodation. And he argues that \u201ca two-bedroom bed and breakfast has the same requirements placed on it as a two-bedroom Airbnbhost\u201d. There are no compulsory safety inspections on either. He also says that the expectation placed on the company is far higher: \u201cInviting somebody into your home is a big step.\u201d But what would happen if an Airbnb guest was harmed by fire, or a carbon monoxide leak \u2013 a constant concern for hotels. Airbnb\u2019s site says owners \u201cshould\u201d make sure they have a functioning CO detector and are following gas safety regulations. But although the money for any stay is paid via Airbnb, Robinson says he doesn\u2019t know who would be responsible if someone were injured that way. \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer,\u201d says Robinson. It seems surprising that the eventuality hasn\u2019t come up in business meetings, but Robinson declines to discuss it. It\u2019s a scenario that has exercised insurance companies, which are wrestling with the question of who is liable in a collision involving a car being driven on an Uber journey, or one of the other car rental services, or a complaint involving Airbnb clients. Premiums might rise, or need extra tweaking. Everyone involved agrees that these businesses look unstoppable. The question is how far regulations will shape them to behave more like the traditional businesses that they\u2019re trying to supplant. \u201cWhat I would be impressed by is the \u2018sharing economy\u2019 companies trying to get social justice,\u201d says Greenham. \u201cThe whole concept of sharing isn\u2019t very compatible with the accumulation of private capital, after all. \u201cWhat\u2019s irreversible is the technological element. But maybe some of these platforms would be more socially responsible if they were owned by the users, rather than venture capitalists in Silicon Valley.\u201d", "sentences": ["In Amsterdam last week the company agreed to collect potentially millions of euros in tourist taxes after complaints from hoteliers."], "title": "Why the sharing economy could be the internet\u2019s most divisive revolution yet", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/21/sharing-economy-divisive-uber-airbnb", "tags": ["E-commerce", "Uber", "Airbnb", "Internet", "Technology", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Travel & leisure", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-24T07:00:00Z", "article": "One of the most famous stories about John Osborne concerns a meeting with Kenneth Tynan, who had just been appointed literary manager of the National Theatre. \u201cCome and join us at the National and make history,\u201d said Tynan. \u201cI\u2019ve already made it,\u201d snapped Osborne, turning on his heel.  It is perfectly true that if Osborne, who has died aged 65, had written only Look Back in Anger his place in the history books would be secure: its premiere at the Royal Court in May 1956 not only put the English Stage Company on the map, but proved to a generation of writers that it was possible to put contemporary Britain on stage. But there was more \u2013 much more \u2013 to Osborne than that single resonant play.   He was, in my view, a much misunderstood writer. Because of Look Back in Anger, he was instantly dubbed an Angry Young Man \u2013 a phrase coined by the Royal Court\u2019s press officer \u2013 and seen as a flame-throwing socialist who eventually turned Right.   The truth is that Osborne was a congenital outsider: a truculent individualist with a gift for lacerating invective and with little time for political parties or handed-down truths. I always saw him as a somewhat Byronic figure, viewing the passing world with satirical disdain. He once recorded how one of his wives described him \u2013 probably more accurately \u2013 as a Welsh Fulham upstart. Either way, he was a compulsive non-joiner whose gift for rhetoric re-charged British drama in the 1950s and 1960s and who ultimately produced two outstanding, self-punishing volumes of autobiography.   As with all writers, his upbringing explains his later attitudes. He was born in Fulham in 1929, the son of an advertising agency copywriter and a barmaid. Describing Christmas get-togethers in A Better Class of Person, he writes that, \u201cWhat the two families shared was the heart pumped from birth by misgiving. Not a proud misgiving of the spirit but a timid melancholy or dislike of joy, effort or courage.\u201d It was a world of lower middle-class bitterness which Osborne sought to escape, but by which he was always partially claimed.   From the start, he was always a rebel. When a master struck the 16-year-old Osborne at school, he responded by striking back \u2013 a gesture for which he was expelled and which suggested his permanent symbol was the untugged forelock.      John Osborne, right, with Kenneth Haigh who played Jimmy Porter in Look Back in Anger in 1956. Photograph: Frank Pocklington/Getty Images     A desultory period as a journalist working for trade papers \u2013 Gas World, Nursery World and the Miller \u2013 was followed in 1948 by entry into the theatre as assistant stage manager on a 48-week tour of No Room at the Inn, and by a long, productive period as a rep actor. He may not have been a brilliant actor \u2013 he once described his Hayling Island Hamlet as \u201ca passable impersonation of Claudius after a night\u2019s carousing\u201d \u2013 but he learned his craft, co-wrote a couple of plays, and married his first wife, Pamela Lane. In a revealing letter about that period, he once wrote to me that he joined his wife in Derby, where she was playing Hester Collyer \u2013 a woman almost destroyed by her inability to find an answering passion in her lovers \u2013 in Rattigan\u2019s The Deep Blue Sea. \u201cMy notional role in life,\u201d said Osborne, \u201cwas that of Freddie Page (the object of the heroine\u2019s love). In fact, I was Hester.\u201d   It is a revealing remark because it shows Osborne\u2019s affection for the older generation of writers \u2013 Rattigan especially \u2013 whom he was to displace. But it also explains a lot about Osborne\u2019s most famous hero: Jimmy Porter in Look Back in Anger, which George Devine bravely put on at the Royal Court in 1956. Jimmy is, in some ways, a male Hester: his tragic flaw is that he seeks in others a passionate enthusiasm to match his own. Of course, as memorably incarnated by Kenneth Haigh in Tony Richardson\u2019s production, he also became a symbol of angry, alienated modern youth railing at the English class system and the whole gummed-up Establishment. But Jimmy\u2019s rage and rhetoric is also part of a quest for what he himself calls \u201ca burning virility of mind and spirit that looks for something as powerful as itself\u201d.   However you look at it \u2013 as social document or Strindbergian study in self-torment \u2013 it remains a great play. It also turned Osborne into an overnight celebrity. The 26-year-old playwright was endlessly interviewed, courted and nibbled at by gossip columnists \u2013 one of whom described him, libellously, as \u201cthe original teddy-boy\u201d.   Amidst all this, he found time to write a second play for the Court, The Entertainer, which elicited from Olivier one of his greatest performances as the seedy, third-rate music-hall comic, Archie Rice. Those of us lucky enough to have seen it will never forget Olivier\u2019s leering, painted public mask or his private howls of self-loathing. What subsequent revivals have shown is that it is also a brutally bitter play about family life: the Rices\u2019 endless recriminatory rows must have owed a lot to Osborne\u2019s own Fulham origins.   Osborne\u2019s life was changed by fame and success. He married Mary Ure. He bought houses in Chelsea and the Kent countryside. He earned a bob or two. But, at heart, he remained a natural dissenter and he soon learned that he had not won the affection either of Fleet Street or the theatre-going public. In 1959, he wrote a musical about gossip columnists, The World Of Paul Slickey, which earned vitriolic reviews and which led, on the first night, to Osborne being pursued up Charing Cross Road by parties of irate theatre-goers. Osborne\u2019s vivid description of the scene in Almost A Gentleman suggests he got a high from being so hated.      A leering, painted public mask and private howls of self-loathing \u2026 Laurence Olivier as Archie Rice in Osborne\u2019s The Entertainer. Photograph: Hulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis     Through all the private traumas of the 1960s \u2013 in 1963 he married Penelope Gilliatt, and in 1968 Jill Bennett \u2013 he continued to write plays and one famously successful, money-spinning film script, Tom Jones. But his work was still characterised by unassuaged discontent. In 1961, he wrote a Brechtian chronicle play about the founder of Protestantism, Luther, but once again the hero seemed like a projection of Osborne himself. As Tynan shrewdly noted at the time, \u201cLuther in Christendom, like Mr Osborne in the microcosm of the theatre, was a stubborn iconoclast of lowly birth, resentful of authority and blind to compromise.\u201d   It was followed in 1964 by an even more remarkable play, Inadmissible Evidence, in which Nicol Williamson gave an unforgettable performance as a middle-aged solicitor watching the total disintegration of his life \u2013 \u201ca kind of Willy Loman in striped English serge\u201d, as Ronald Bryden wrote. But in the hero\u2019s blistering rhetoric and punitive self-laceration it was again not difficult to detect something of Osborne\u2019s own private rage and sense of being permanently wounded.   But Osborne\u2019s biggest play of that period, A Patriot for Me, was also one that in 1965 fell foul of the Lord Chamberlain\u2019s arbitrary power of censorship. Staged at the Royal Court as a club production for consenting theatre-goers, it was a turbulent epic about Alfred Redl, a homosexual spy in the Austro-Hungarian army. It allowed Osborne to write on a big canvas, to pursue the subject of sexual ambiguity \u2013 by which he had always been fascinated \u2013 and to create one brilliantly theatrical scene in which a group of exquisitely-gowned figures dancing to Mozart turned out, on close inspection, to be men. One of Osborne\u2019s richest plays, it had to wait until Ronald Eyre\u2019s 1983 Chichester production, with Alan Bates, to achieve the success it deserved.   After the high peak of A Patriot for Me, Osborne enjoyed fluctuating fortunes. The Hotel in Amsterdam \u2013 written in 1968 and scarcely revived since \u2013 was an elegant tone-poem about a group of six friends, all fleeing from the influence of a tyrannical film producer. West of Suez, in 1971, was seen by many as the moment when Osborne turned Right. Set in a former British colony, it was widely viewed as a hymn to lost empires: one of the first plays I ever reviewed in these pages, I wrote at the time that it was actually about \u201cthe break-up of any civilisation that no longer puts its trust in reason, in respect for other people\u2019s values and, above all, in language\u201d. It was a view from which I gather Osborne himself did not entirely dissent.   But where Osborne had once been claimed as the spokesman for a generation, he came in later years to be seen as a rancorous theatrical Thersites. A Sense of Detachment, in 1972, with its attack on the corruption of language and the prevalence of pornography, found few supporters. Watch It Come Down, staged at the Old Vic in 1976, was an intriguing but intellectually muddled attempt to do a latterday Heartbreak House. And Deja Vu, a 1992 update on the life and times of Jimmy Porter, while full of vintage Osborne bile, failed to take the West End by storm.   So how important a writer was John Osborne? Without a shadow of doubt, he helped to change the face of postwar British theatre, and nothing can take that away from him. He also wrote at least half-a-dozen plays that will have a claim on posterity. But I suspect he will be remembered as well for his two volumes of autobiography, A Better Class of Person and Almost a Gentleman, which reveal him as one of the most incandescent prose writers of his generation. And to those who object to the vicious assault on his former wife, Jill Bennett, I can only quote the remark of a friend who said to me that he must have once loved her a lot to have hated her so much.   As for the man himself, he was a bundle of contradictions. From my slight acquaintanceship, I found he could be as charming and courteous in private as he could be blisteringly rude in print. And in later years, though he achieved domestic happiness with his fifth wife, Helen Dawson, there was something saddening about his alienation from the current theatrical scene. In the course of a very funny letter to me about Terence Rattigan, he reflected on the short period of popularity most dramatists enjoy, and remarked: \u201cI seem to incite only dislike and indifference in whatever I attempt. I never did have much of a following. Now even that remnant is apparently gone. It\u2019s a mistake to stick around too long.\u201d   But though Osborne fell out of theatrical fashion, the best of his work will survive. He once described his plays as \u201clessons in feeling\u201d. And his unique gift was to create fiercely articulate dramatic heroes who embodied his own wounded and damaged spirit. He was, to the very last, a man with a talent for dissent.  \u2022 John James Osborne, born 12 December 1929; died 24 December 1994", "sentences": ["The Hotel in Amsterdam \u2013 written in 1968 and scarcely revived since \u2013 was an elegant tone-poem about a group of six friends, all fleeing from the influence of a tyrannical film producer."], "title": "John Osborne: a natural dissenter who changed the face of British theatre", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/24/john-osborne-a-natural-dissenter-who-changed-the-face-of-british-theatre", "tags": ["John Osborne", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-26T19:36:17Z", "article": "There is no Christmas tree this year at the Gomes residence in Kuala Lumpur, no lights, and no big celebration over the holiday season; there\u2019s nothing to celebrate. Jacquita Gonzales\u2019 husband is still missing. \u201cUsually Patrick is on leave from 22 December up until new year, so he would be home for almost two weeks,\u201d she says of her childhood sweetheart, Patrick Gomes, the lead steward on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared on 8 March en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. \u201cI\u00a0keep thinking of the Christmas carol I\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas, and I just keep hoping he\u2019ll be home. But because he\u2019s not around, it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d The couple met when she was 12 and married when she was 22. She recently celebrated his 55th birthday without him. Life without Gomes over the past nine months has been an emotional rollercoaster, she says, beginning with the way she learned her husband\u2019s flight had simply vanished from radar screens: a friend watching CNN phoned her with the news the next morning. Since then there\u2019s been little more than speculation, conspiracy theories and titbits of tangible information about what really happened that fateful spring morning, when MH370 disappeared with all 239 people on board. Analysis of satellite \u201cpings\u201d emitted by the plane saw investigators conclude that it probably crashed somewhere in the Indian Ocean, but search teams have yet to turn up any evidence. Australia\u2019s Transportation Safety Bureau has been leading a deep-sea search for the plane over a 55,000 sq km priority area, much of which is 6,000 metres below the sea\u2019s surface. Without any wreckage, evidence or viable cause for the crash, Gonzales and her four children \u2013 three daughters aged 29, 27 and 25, and a son, 15 \u2013 have been left bewildered and traumatised. They keep the house in order in hope of Gomes\u2019s return \u2013 a hope that still exists amidst the uncertainty and fear that surrounds his disappearance. His flight uniform is in a basket, waiting to be ironed, his shoes and slippers just outside the door. \u201cNothing has changed,\u201d says Gonzales. \u201cWhen we talk or grumble [with one another] we still say, \u2018Just wait til your father gets back, he\u2019s going to be so upset with you.\u2019\u201d She laughs quietly. \u201cWe try to keep things comfortable so that when he comes back he can relax.\u201d Gonzales says she reads everything about what may have happened to the plane: theories it was hijacked, or laden with lithium-ion batteries that exploded, or otherwise succumbed to foul play. But none of it provides any lasting peace, because none of the answers are final. \u201cSometimes the speculations [seem] so real that you go, \u2018OK, there\u2019s a chance everything\u2019s going to be OK.\u2019 And then something else comes along and you\u2019re just falling flat again,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just try to keep busy every day so you don\u2019t just think and think and think \u2026 [Then] you\u2019ll be driving in the car and suddenly your mind wanders and you just start crying.\u201d Gonzales rejected the airline\u2019s offer of therapy and initially sought consolation from other, equally bewildered, MH370 crew families, with whom she still shares stories and tears. Then, in July, after flight MH17 was believed to have been shot down in Ukraine en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Gonzales began offering her own counselling to the bereaved family members of those on board \u2013 an effort, she says, that could only be borne by those who knew exactly what they were going through. \u201cThey seem pretty OK,\u201d Gonzales says of the MH17 victims\u2019 relatives to whom she reached out. \u201cThey have had closure already and I think they are just moving on. Now it\u2019s about finding out who shot the plane down, as most of the [other] stuff has already been settled.\u201d She goes quiet, her sadness tinged perhaps with understandable envy for the answers she wishes she had. Like her, many other relatives of those on board MH370 are also waiting for their loved ones to come home. Most have refused the airline\u2019s initial compensation offer of $50,000 (\u00a332,100) provided to next of kin, according to Malaysia\u2019s transport minister. \u201cWe have extended the initial compensation of $50,000 to the family members but unfortunately many still do not want to receive it because they still consider their family members are still alive as we have yet to find any aircraft or bodies from the MH370 tragedy.\u201d It has been a bad year for Malaysia Airlines: first MH370, then MH17; massive job cuts; an insensitively titled ticket contest named \u201cMy Ultimate Bucket List\u201d; a steward charged with sexually assaulting a passenger; and ultimately its expected delisting and $2bn restructuring. But the worst for Gonzales \u2013 who was herself a flight attendant \u2013 was the chief executive\u2019s statement that MH370 would be officially declared \u201clost\u201d by the year end to expedite insurance claims for the\u00a0bereaved. \u201cHow can you [force] closure?\u201d she asks, incredulous. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that everything is just over \u2013 we are still around, we are still waiting. I don\u2019t think we will ever let them close [things] until we have an answer to where the plane is.\u201d Her daughters avoid the news. They are waiting for tangible answers before they make any conclusions about their father\u2019s fate. But Gonzales knows her son is suffering. His room is scattered with old photographs taken from family and wedding albums, though he keeps his anguish quiet. The most important thing, she says, is to keep the conversation going, whether it\u2019s at home or in the public eye \u2013 so that no one forgets that the mystery still hasn\u2019t been solved. \u201cThere are still 239 lives that are out there missing, we need people to keep asking questions and keeping it alive so that the [search team] who are helping with the search know that we are still waiting,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a waste of their time to be out there looking in the Indian Ocean, so far away from their own families. We really, really appreciate it.\u201d", "sentences": ["Then, in July, after flight MH17 was believed to have been shot down in Ukraine en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Gonzales began offering her own counselling to the bereaved family members of those on board \u2013 an effort, she says, that could only be borne by those who knew exactly what they were going through."], "title": "Flight MH370: \u2018I just keep hoping he\u2019ll come home\u2019", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/26/mh370-still-missing-chief-steward-patrick-gomez-jacquitta-gonzales", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Malaysia", "China", "Australia news", "Airline industry", "Air transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-28T00:37:00Z", "article": "The mid-morning rain is making Dublin soft and grey once more, and on the big southern approach road into the city an annual benediction is taking place on this feast of Stephen. Dozens of cars are parked head to foot outside the city\u2019s Glasnevin cemetery as Dublin\u2019s living, laden with flowers and memories, bring tributes to their one and a half million dead. Though barely 24 hours have elapsed since the dawn of Christmas day, this will be the only public display of piety we will witness for a while in a city that was once a theme park of religious devotion. \u201cIreland no longer puts its trust in the Catholic church,\u201d I am told later that day. Nowhere is this black epiphany more apparent than in Dublin, where the betrayal and denial of the clergy over child sexual abuse was most keenly felt and most probably will never be forgiven. But what do you do with all that spiritual energy, that desire to be transported beyond earthly concerns? Holy Ireland, and especially Dubliners, it seems, are channelling it all into festivals. There is now barely a day in the calendar when Ireland isn\u2019t observing and commemorating its non-religious culture line by line, stanza by stanza, step by step; in music, verse and play. In the 21st century there is one commodity that Ireland possesses more than churches and that is workshops. On Tuesday another festival gets under way in Ireland\u2019s capital, encompassing all the shouts and cadences of the modern big festival experience \u2013 only bigger, and with memes and tropes all over the place. Jump into Ireland for a three-day gluttony of traditional and popular culture that the city\u2019s sanhedrin is hoping will thrust it into the A-list of festival destinations at new year. Some of the world\u2019s most dramatic and iconic cities now compete with each other to determine which is best to see in the new year. Millions of tourist dollars are at stake, as well as the prize of being included in the morning news montages all around the globe showing the best of the night\u2019s fireworks displays. Dublin and places such as Amsterdam and Madrid occupy a rung below London, New York and Edinburgh, but it is in that elite company that Dublin seeks to belong. Last week, Ireland\u2019s minister for tourism, Paschal Donohoe, said the festival \u201cbrings with it the opportunity to ring out the old and ring in the new to a greater extent than ever before. It also presents a valuable opportunity to put Ireland centre stage and promote the brilliant things we have to see and do here in Ireland.\u201d Indeed if you don\u2019t emerge improved from this cultural whole body massage, then it means you\u2019re probably already dead. There\u2019s something called a food village (will it have a Hansel and Gretel cottage?); three-dimensional light projections all over the city; and a spoken-word festival. There\u2019s a procession of light and, on the last day, family and fitness-themed fun-run workshops. The headline act is Kodaline, the anthemic Irish rock band who sound a bit like Coldplay, only awake. There does seem to be a problem, though one which I\u2019m sure can be overcome: nobody I speak to knows anything about Dublin\u2019s big New Year\u2019s Festival, known as NYF Dublin. In the city\u2019s fabled Temple Bar district, once a bohemian enclave of artists and poets and now Europe\u2019s go-to hen and stag destination, I am slurping Guinness (you can never sip it) in a tavern of many lounges. It\u2019s not yet noon and I\u2019ve counted more than 100 people listening to an ancient and very good folk duo singing about rural injustices and flaxen-haired wantons. I am joined by Anthony O\u2019Flaherty, a young Dublin artist who makes ceramics and prints and, you would have thought, possesses all the target social and cultural indicators for the new year\u2019s festival. \u201cI\u2019d never heard of it until you mentioned it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis city is mobbed in the summer, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to travel here in the winter.\u201d At Christmas time there is a mass exodus of Dublin residents back to the countryside whence many of them came. \u201cHome to our mammies,\u201d said Anthony. My taxi driver, Robbie Humphrey, has lived in Dublin for every one of his 36 years. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard of this festival either. And if an experienced Dublin taxi driver hasn\u2019t heard of it, that\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d he said. The young German couple in the smoking area of my new favourite pub are being importuned by a man with the sort of hat and ambience that suggest he\u2019s heading for the St Stephen\u2019s day races at Leopardstown. None of them knows about the NYF either. \u201cWe just wanted to be in Ireland for Christmas,\u201d said the couple, \u201cand not in Germany.\u201d Nor is the barman in Fitzsimmons across the street aware of it. \u201cI\u2019d certainly have heard of it by now,\u201d he said dismissively. If you were being cynical, you\u2019d dismiss the concept as an exercise in trying to hitch Dublin\u2019s coat-tails to Edinburgh\u2019s Hogmanay, which, it is reasonable to conclude, has provided the gold standard for the global new year celebration oeuvre. But you\u2019d be wrong. The aftershocks of the global recession still rumble here, though there is a greater mood of optimism than when last I visited. It\u2019s too early yet to glimpse the crest of any waves, but the New Year\u2019s Festival represents, perhaps, a city feeling better about itself and daring once more to order champagne cocktails. Besides, Edinburgh\u2019s Hogmanay is a one-night only, adult extravaganza built around alcohol, hugely expensive music acts and the musk of sexual adventure. It has become a pagan festival for committed hedonists with a bit of money in their pockets. What Dublin is attempting is something a little less edgy and a little more wholesome, a festival in which entire families may participate. Edinburgh is a boutique city where a bus tour of its main attractions will take up less than a lunch-time. Dublin is a proper metropolis that demands to be studied instead of merely flattered. Paul Heffernan, of Dublin city council, is delighted with what Dublin\u2019s festival has achieved in the four years since its inception. He makes no apologies for there being many different cultural festivals. \u201cWe want our festival to be family-friendly and there is a good reason for that. When they are done right they have the potential to engage people in Ireland\u2019s rich cultural tapestry, people who might not normally attend the theatre or poetry readings or literary festivals. And while there may be some people who haven\u2019t heard of Dublin\u2019s New Year\u2019s Festival, they soon will. Already the concert by Kodaline is completely sold out.\u201d In February there will be a huge Chinese festival, followed by the Battle of Clontarf festival commemorating one of Europe\u2019s most significant Viking engagements 1,000 years ago. And then, rather gloriously, One City, One Book, in which Dublin celebrates its peerless literary firmament by choosing one book and then, literally, teaching its residents how to appreciate it. In 2015 it\u2019s Roddy Doyle\u2019s The Barrytown Trilogy; in previous years it\u2019s been Dracula, Strumpet City and Flann O\u2019Brien\u2019s At Swim-Two-Birds. It\u2019s a far more authentic literary event than those where scores of avaricious authors and agents descend like locusts, devouring all restraint, judgment and alfalfa crepes. Even glimpsed through folds of rain, Dublin still beguiles and you wonder why it feels it needs to sell itself, this city of Joyce, Yeats and O\u2019Casey; of Easter 1916, Phoenix Park and Guinness; of the Abbey theatre and now Google.

The plane lost contact when it was believed to be over the Java Sea between Kalimantan and Java islands, Mustofa said. He said the weather in the area was cloudy.

It was a devastating scene: there were adults and children who had symptoms being brought in by ambulance and put in an empty classroom for processing, with just a couple of mattresses in the corner of the room. The sick and the healthy were all in the same space, which I found really disheartening. I was in my PPE [personal protective equipment] suit and could only work in it for short bursts of time \u2013 your goggles get fogged up and the heat is unbearable. The next morning I went back to take another look, and when I arrived I discovered that some people had died overnight. There were sick people and corpses in the same room. I walked into another classroom and found this health worker spraying down a victim with a chlorine/bleach spray to decontaminate him to some extent so that the body could be taken out for cremation. The bodies of Ebola victims are almost like \u201cvirus bombs\u201d \u2013 highly infectious and highly contagious, so health workers are doing extremely heroic work. I was scared. And I was very conscious of everything I touched. But the hardest part was seeing all the sick children come in. Being a father myself, it\u2019s very distressing to see. I watched a family of six siblings walk in ill \u2013 and only three walk out. My time in Liberia was very humbling. We have no idea what these people are going through and are far too busy getting hysterical about a few victims of Ebola in the western world. The people working in healthcare in Liberia and Sierra Leone are heroes. The response of the international community has been bolstered, but we could be doing much more. I still believe that. One of Britain\u2019s best-known entertainers goes on trial 9 May: Rolf Harris arrives at Southwark crown court with his wife and daughter at the start of his trail for indecent assault.     Rolf Harris arrives at court with his wife Alwen and daughter Bindi. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images    Liz Dux, co-lead lawyer representing Jimmy Savile victims: At the time Rolf Harris went on trial there were questions being raised about Operation Yewtree and the cogency of the evidence after the acquittals of Dave Lee Travis, William Roache and Michael Le Vell. I was getting comments from people saying I\u2019d ruined their childhood. They were incredulous that Harris could be implicated and were beginning to feel it was a celebrity witch hunt. The women who gave evidence found it unbelievably stressful. They didn\u2019t know each other beforehand; they\u2019d not been allowed to talk to each other or know what other evidence existed. The trial was incredibly bruising. They were all infuriated by the way Harris behaved at court, disgusted by his arrogant behaviour, singing in court and making didgeridoo sounds. The charade of arriving with his wife really annoyed me. Everyone knew they\u2019d come in different cars and just walked in together. A lot of people who weren\u2019t knowledgeable about the case were sure he\u2019d escape justice. Media reports didn\u2019t emphasise the consistency in the testimony. The victims found the media intrusion very difficult. One came home to find reporters outside her house. She hadn\u2019t told her daughter about the abuse at that point, and was then forced to \u2013 which is terrible. None of them has regrets, though. All of them know that society is a better place now that Harris has been brought to justice. A lot of Savile victims blame themselves for not coming forward earlier: they feel a huge sense of guilt that he went on to assault others. It\u2019s comforting for the Harris victims that they\u2019ve done the right thing. All of them felt that the sentence was too light. This was a motivating factor in bringing civil claims. None of them contemplated civil action before the trial, but some of them have suffered significant harm. I think Harris represented a sea change in the way we as a society view these cases. With Savile, he\u2019s seen as a monster. People felt Clifford was Machiavellian. But Harris was well liked and well known. For the trial to have shown that this was a facade, that he was an arrogant man who felt he was too famous to be held accountable, was extremely important. The Philae probe lands on a comet after a 10-year journey 13 November: Matt Taylor relives the day that their small lander made contact with Comet 67P and began to send messages home.     Mission control: a combination photo of different images taken with Philae\u2019s CIVA camera system. It shows Rosetta\u2019s lander Philae on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Photograph: AP    Matt Taylor, Rosetta project scientist: I started the day at 3.30am. I\u2019d gone to bed at midnight after talking about whether it might not happen. Then a little ping on my phone told me that everything was looking fine, so I came straight in. Then you are waiting. Waiting for each of the mission\u2019s milestones to pass \u2013 the first big one was where the lander had been released. I was actually in a press interview on Nasa TV via Skype next to the main auditorium room and I could see through the window when they put up the first images. It was a day of relief and stress and a real rollercoaster of emotions. It still has not really sunk in. I was just very relieved when the lander was released from the orbiter in the first place \u2013 and when it actually got to the comet. The highlight of that week for me was when I was sitting at home on the Saturday morning seeing some of the first data that had come down from Philae and the first processed Osiris images from Rosetta showing the lander trajectory above the comet. I got my wife and two kids to come and look at the data. That\u2019s where the excitement really peaks, when you suddenly realise that you are part of something quite big and quite important. I think the media attention in the Rosetta mission is justified because it is big and crazy that we did this. It\u2019s got excitement, it\u2019s got this adventure, it\u2019s got exploration, it\u2019s got technological challenges and it\u2019s got science \u2013 that\u2019s the whole reason we\u2019re there in the first place. But there is this human aspect, this historical connection with comets that goes through eons \u2013 if you look, the Bayeux tapestry has got Halley\u2019s comet on it. This mission is going to tell us how a comet works, why they are there, how they are there and then you can link that up with other theories of solar system evolution to get an idea of how the planets are where they are now, how the sun became and ultimately why we are here. Rosetta is a massively complex mission. And I can now say we did it. Church of England rules in favour of female bishops 14 July: Clergy celebrate the historic vote.     New era: members of the clergy take a selfie as they celebrate victory. Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP/Getty Images    Right Rev David Walker, bishop of Manchester: The vote on women bishops at General Synod was one of the most emotional days I can recall, not least because it had taken us so long and it was such a troubled journey to get there. And yet we didn\u2019t scrape over the line begrudgingly in a bad-tempered debate, we got there after some passionate and stirring speeches and with overwhelming majorities. After some quite difficult debates in previous years we had a final debate that had a much more settled feel. There was a very telling speech from John Spence, a man with incredible experience in the commercial sector who has been blind for many years. He spoke with real understanding about what it means to have trust when you can\u2019t see. The lead came significantly from Justin Welby in his first month as Archbishop of Canterbury. We had tried for several years to legislate for every possible circumstance. Instead, he got us to think of how we would build trust across the deeply held differences of opinion. We\u2019ve learned from time talking to each other so we could go forward with much simpler legislation and with a commitment to be sensitive to one another. And that\u2019s a better basis for a Christian organisation. We had to get a two thirds majority and every house voted over three quarters in favour. So that moment of the selfie \u2013 Rev Sharon Jones on the left, Rev Andy Salmon on the right \u2013 was this huge sense of relief not only that we had got there but that we had held together. Ceramic poppies surround the Tower of London 11 November: 888,246 poppies commemorate first world war dead.     \u2018Each night we had a roll of honour and would read out 180 names of those who lost their lives\u2019.  Photograph: Nick Harvey/Rex Features    Tom Piper, designer: We began work on the poppies in 2013. Paul Cummins, the ceramic artist who made them, was inspired by the poem The Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, written by an anonymous soldier. So it was his idea to have one poppy represent one soldier; the Tower of London suggested working with a theatre designer. My job was to create \u201cmoments\u201d, such as the weeping window and the wave. The amount of time it took to produce the poppies meant we did the project in phases, delivering 70,000 to the Tower each week from the workshop in the Midlands. At first we had 12 volunteers; by the end we had three shifts a day and more than 21,000 volunteers. There was a great sense of teamwork, and we quickly became the most Instagrammed thing in the world. Companies donated free scaffolding and even paint. We worried about frost, so we wrapped the metal prongs of the poppies in insulating tape. Each night we\u2019d have a roll of honour: someone would read out 180 names of those who lost their lives. That was solemn. It touched me that the poppies stimulated people to research their own relatives, and families of current servicemen were hugely invested in the six charities we were raising money for. People were thinking about the present and the cost of all wars. Eventually weeds were growing through the poppies, spiders living in them. Taking them all down at the end was a bit like disrupting an ecosystem. Some wanted the installation to go on, but we had been funded by the public buying the poppies. To date, we\u2019ve made more than \u00a31m for each of the six charities, and in 2018 some of the poppies will go to the Imperial War Museum. The poppies have brought me and Paul great reward, and pain \u2013 Paul lost a finger in the process! But I don\u2019t think we would hesitate to do it all again.

Photograph: @Emily Thornberry/Twitter    Ben Thornberry, Emily\u2019s brother: It was my 50th birthday and I was in France with other members of the family when we heard that Emily had resigned. I couldn\u2019t believe it. When I first saw the picture, I thought it was the council house we had grown up in as children. I don\u2019t understand how people could look at that picture and get the idea of Emily looking down her nose at people. Her Islington constituency has a reputation for being full of uppity champagne socialists, but it has the second-highest level of child poverty in the country and the highest rate of male suicide. Emily won her majority, turning a marginal into a safe seat, because she is committed to the working class. We always knew this was going to be a dirty election campaign. The right-wing media has been out to get Emily for a long time, because she is a strong woman who is a lawyer, and they behaved abominably. Reporters even camped outside my house and wrote a lot of crap about me, asking how I could be a builder and a photographer at the same time. I\u2019m gay and I think there was a lot of thinly disguised homophobia. In the end I tipped a bucket of water over a Daily Mail reporter\u2019s head. This was never about Emily\u2019s perception of the picture, just the media\u2019s, and it said more about their prejudices than hers. I think when people step back and look at the whole incident, they will think: \u201cWhat happened in that 24 hours? What rabbit hole did we fall down?\u201d It was a weird episode. Bearded lady Conchita Wurst wins Eurovision 10 May: Austrian drag artist takes the world by storm.     \u2018There is no denying it: Conchita is stunning\u2019.  Photograph: Scanpix Denmark/Reuters    Molly Smitten-Downes, UK contestant: I first learned about Conchita at the BBC building, when I had just agreed to be the UK entry for Eurovision. I had, of course, huge reservations about entering a competition not exactly renowned in the UK for its credibility even before I\u2019d heard about the bearded lady. Bearded lady? Of course there\u2019d be a bearded lady \u2013 this is Eurovision! My preconception of what she would look like couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. Pre-performance, in a changing room in Amsterdam, I admired, from behind, the form of this beautiful, tall lady in a floor-length backless dress. She had an intricate tattoo on her back, and I thought: \u201cWow! She looks great!\u201d Then she turned around. I was taken aback, as were the male members of my band, who had obviously also been admiring her. There is no denying it: Conchita is stunning. Not only that, but also elegant and warm-hearted, with a wonderful presence. To me and many others, it seems, she is beautiful inside and out. On the night, although we were disappointed with the results of our efforts, I was thrilled for Conchita\u2019s triumph. Unarmed Ukrainian servicemen confront Russian troops in Crimea 4 March: Colonel Yuli Mamchor led his soldiers through the Russian troops to regain control over the captured airbase in Belbek, Crimea.     Show of strength: as tensions increase between Ukraine and Russia, Colonel Yuli Mamchor, commander of the military garrison at the Belbek airbase, leads his unarmed troops back into the airfield. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images    Yuli Mamchor, Ukrainian army colonel: At the first stage of our war against Russia, it was the volunteer battalions who stood to defend our motherland. The Ministry of Defence had been slow. It took a long time for them to start mobilisation as we didn\u2019t have normal army recruitment structure. So the volunteer battalions had to take the first blow. When the Russians captured Belbek, I spent three and a half days in custody. On the first day I had a meeting with six masked FSB [Federal Security Service] people. Their only aim was to make me defect to the Russian side. They knew my biography very well, they knew that I\u2019d graduated from the Soviet military school and given an oath to the Soviet Union. They pressed me on this and spoke about the greatness of Russian aviation. But as a military pilot, I know the truth. So they failed. After that I was taken to solitary confinement where they psychologically pressurised me, not allowing me to sleep. Then, on 26 March I asked to go for a short walk. When I was walking an officer of Black Sea Fleet showed up and told me that he\u2019d had an order to move me out of Crimea. Five hours later I was in Chongar [a strategic gateway between Crimea and the mainland]. About 80% of my unit were native Crimeans, so most of them stayed in Crimea. There were also some people who believed the talk about the \u201cgreat Russian army\u201d and promises of high salaries. I didn\u2019t expect this from them. I consider them traitors. We had a very difficult July-September with many soldiers killed and many vehicles destroyed. The ceasefire allowed us to build muscle. Our plants are working at three shifts, constructing tanks, airplanes, armoured vehicles and cannons. Many say we should advance but we need to be realistic. In 23 years of independence, the financing of the army was very poor and we can\u2019t reach full operational capacity just in six months. This ceasefire has allowed us to dig in and to construct fortifications. When we get enough vehicles we will be ready to return to the Donbas [Donetsk basin]. I\u2019m a supporter of diplomatic solutions, because otherwise there will be new losses. But if Russia starts attacking, our military forces will be ready to resist it. President Poroshenko personally proposed me to become a candidate in parliament, but I still feel rather a military man than a lawmaker. I want to work for changes in our army, to convert it into a professional model. I think the world has realised Putin is leading them a pretty dance. Our diplomacy together with a rejuvenated army would allow us to fully liberate Donbas and, later, Crimea. But we need to work together with Europe and the US. \u2022 Read more eyewitness accounts of 2014 ", "sentences": ["Pre-performance, in a changing room in Amsterdam, I admired, from behind, the form of this beautiful, tall lady in a floor-length backless dress."], "title": "2014: Eyewitness accounts of the year's defining events", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/28/-sp-2014-eyewitness-accounts-of-the-years-defining-events", "tags": ["World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-29T06:00:08Z", "article": "NORTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPE Fluxus Ministerija, Lithuania We once played a show in Lithuania in a space called called Fluxus Ministerija. It was an old shoe factory and felt like a squat party, but with about 10,000 people, loads of weird art installations and AV projections. You would walk through one entire section of the building, about the size of Fabric in London, then arrive in a massive hall with totally different music and people. It went on until about 5pm the following day. There were loads of crazy installations and sculptures, and a massive staircase that led to a tower, where some kind of poetry seance was going on. It didn\u2019t have the sinister feeling you sometimes get at squat parties in the UK.        Photograph: https://www.facebook.com/Fluxusministerija/photos_stream    The idea was to create a space or event that celebrated the Fluxus art movement: founding artist Jurgis Ma\u010di\u016bnas was Lithuanian. After our soundcheck we met one of the stage crew, who told us that Lithuania was full of these sort of spaces, but that hardly any of them are used. I would love to go there again. \u2022 fluxusministerija.lt Chosen by Breton Berghain Panorama Bar, Berlin It\u2019s a super obvious one but I\u2019d have to say Panorama in Berlin. For me it\u2019s still one of the best clubs in the world for DJs. They don\u2019t allow phones into the club \u2013 which makes the experience all the more special \u2013 and the club has a great door policy. The sound is amazing in there and there\u2019s always a very patient mixed crowd who go all night. I love it specifically because it\u2019s treated with such reverence by all \u2013 you can\u2019t play the bullshit there. When I play there I commit so far in advance to preparation in order to deliver something special. If every club in the world was like Panorama, it would be beautiful and simple. Berlin has changed over the past few years but it still retains that brilliant vibe that very few others have managed to replicate. \u2022 berghain.de Chosen by Tiga OHM, Berlin In the battery room of a derelict power plant, OHM (previously known as Shift) has broken free from the wing of its older brother Tresor (next door) and is fast becoming one of Berlin\u2019s most worthy off-grid spaces.

Inside, you\u2019ll get cheers and the mood will lighten, but everyone will still be dancing. The windows won\u2019t be steamed up, because they\u2019ll be open \u2013 you can make as much noise as you want when you\u2019re dancing in a boat moored on the Sava river. In summer, the party is upstairs and outside on the deck. 20/44 are Belgrade\u2019s coordinates, but when you look up during the night at the magically lit up Branko\u2019s bridge, you can\u2019t forget where you are.\u2022 facebook.com/pages/Klub-2044 Chosen by Jane Fitz, who runs London party organiser Night Moves and is a resident at Meadows In The Mountains Auslage, Vienna     Photograph: Claudio Farkasch    Auslage keeps things simple: cheap door price, decent drinks, a meaty system, room for 300 people and consistent quality lineups. And like all the best clubs, it\u2019s dark, loud and built for dancing. It has just opened a second floor so now there is one room for house and another for techno. Although the club books serious underground artists from around Europe, the night to keep coming back for is Window Shopping, a monthly party run by Funkroom, a local Viennese collective of DJs and producers who know what they\u2019re doing. \u2022 club-auslage.atChosen by Jane Fitz  Air, Amsterdam          Amsterdam is great for pretty much everything and even better that it\u2019s easy to get to from London. I have been a Defected Records resident at Air for two years. We have hosted some special parties but the ones that stand out are during Amsterdam Dance Event. Thousands of people flock to the city for this every year and Air sells out every night while it\u2019s on. It has a perfect location just off Rembrandt Square and boasts a Void sound system that hits you nicely from all corners of the dancefloor. Each of its three room feels like you are walking into a different club. \u2022 air.nl Chosen by Sam Divine  The Villa, Oslo This is the main place to go in Oslo if you\u2019re into underground tech house and techno, and the club has a really knowledgeable, smart crowd. Nils Noa does the programming and gets in some great DJs, but he\u2019s open to bringing in new acts too. The place is quite \u201csecret\u201d from the outside: you go in through a side door. But above the club is a coffee shop that stays open in the evening so you can pop in for a coffee on your way in. The club is down in the basement and stretches beneath a couple of buildings: it holds about 600 people. It\u2019s one of the more full-on clubs in the city. I love clubs with low ceilings: it really helps to create an intense atmosphere. It\u2019s difficult to move when it gets busy. There\u2019s nowhere to hide or escape the music. Everyone\u2019s really close and so it makes it just about the music. The sweat drips off the ceilings, so don\u2019t get as dressed up here as you would for other places in Oslo. They\u2019re big on knitwear, but not when they\u2019re inside this club! \u2022 thevilla.no Chosen by Jon Rundell Kaffibarinn, Reykjavik       Photograph: Alamy    Kaffibarinn is like our second home. It has everything you need: warm and cosy during the week then weird and crazy on the weekends, where everyone crams into the tiny space to dance the night away and invariably spill drinks over everyone. Our favourite night is Wednesdays, when it has cheap wine and free delicious cheese. As a band, we cannot eat enough cheese, so it\u2019s a win-win situation. We even have a (now not-so) secret whine &amp; wine club where we meet every Wednesday, when we\u2019re not on tour. \u2022 kaffibarinn.is Chosen by Samaris Badaboum, Paris We like this club more than others for several reasons: it used to be a concert hall called La Sc\u00e8ne Bastille and now it\u2019s a mix between concerts and DJ sets, but always tasteful music, nothing mainstream. The place is really cool because it has different rooms with their own ambiences: you begin next to the entrance with a room with tables and sofas where you can have very good cocktails chilling with your friends. This is not common in Paris, it means you can have a break without loud music and have a real conversation. Then you have a dancefloor that\u2019s not too big but enough to dance without feeling like sardines, and good music. When it\u2019s the DJs playing, you can listen to the finest techno and underground electronic music from all around the world, with international guests and small local DJs. It\u2019s the same thing when bands are playing: the lineups are interesting, and the sound system works perfectly without smashing your ears. The last room, upstairs on the first floor, looks like a living room of a small house, with wood everywhere, and old arcade video games. \u2022 badaboum-paris.com Chosen by Montmartre Yoyo, Paris          This place has the same concept as Le Badaboum, so you have both concerts and DJ sets, but a bit more electro. It\u2019s under the Palais de Tokyo, one of the largest sites of European contemporary art. When you are inside, you have a kind of large balcony over your head reminding you the old function of the place - a French cin\u00e9math\u00e8que. With urban decoration and graffs on the walls, you really find the underground feeling in this place. When it\u2019s DJ time, you can have the best of techno/deep house, nu-disco, electro and indie dance music. Sometimes there are special events based on art, with visual concepts behind the performers \u2013 so you\u2019re clubbing but it\u2019s art! We have good memories there because the energy is really great: people are open to new things and happy to be here. People are cool, the drinks are a bit expensive, but we recommend this club for all art lovers.\u2022 yoyo-paris.comChosen by Montmartre Concrete, Paris          From the outside, Concrete is a frighteningly huge boat in the 12th arrondissement with a top terrace where people chill out, have drinks and smoke cigarettes. But once you walk into the boat, you step into a techno-rave den. It started off as an after-hours party running from Sunday to Monday, but became so popular that it has taken over entire weekends. The DJ booth is most impressive in Paris, it\u2019s a square and has the crowd raving all around the DJ. You have to fight your way through the tons of sweaty dancers if you want to catch a glimpse of who\u2019s playing. House rules include, no pictures, no selfies, no filming, only good vibes. Every weekend, techno lovers, music geeks, young ravers and groups of curious middle-aged people cross paths on the boat\u2019s dancefloor. Sunday mornings see a scattered crowd of zombies coming to the end of their rave-marathon, but by 6pm new blood fills up the boat again and a new party begins. There\u2019s nothing scene-y about this place: the focus is on the music, and it\u2019s just all about dancing as much as you can. \u2022 concreteparis.fr Chosen by Girls Girls Girls  Cross Club, Prague      Cross Club is amazing, unique and rather strange. It\u2019s near the centre of Prague and you would hardly believe such a place existed. Created by Franti\u0161ek Chmel\u00edk and his friends, the design and decoration has a clear steampunk influence; with an incredible layout of waste metal, wood and even ceramic, recycled for the occasion. The main room and the beautiful wall light behind the DJ booth make the club even more fantastic. The sound is great, the audience actually know how to dance and the events are all quality.\u2022 crossclub.cz Chosen by Bambounou Salon des amateurs, Dusseldorf This is a modern art museum cafe by day, and one of the most forward-thinking clubs by night. I\u2019ve seen people dance to the most weirdo experimental music here, and the scene around it is a very special one. A lot of kids who grew up in this place listening to the most underground stuff have since started their own amazing projects and bands, which is what a club should be all about. It should inspire. \u2022 salondesamateurs.de Chosen by Young Marco Kaiku, Helsinki If I designed a club it would look like this one. A big wooden box, a great sound system, a Rotary mixer in the booth and working turntables (which is not a given these days, unfortunately). Combine that with a very open-minded crowd and great programming and you have Kaiku. The people behind this place are in it for all the right reasons and pure love of music \u2013 and you will notice it when you\u2019re there. \u2022 clubkaiku.fiChosen by Young Marco Propaganda, Moscow          The booker at Propaganda in Moscow owned one of the first record stores in the city, and has been on the scene for over 20 years. He\u2019s a true music lover and puts a lot of care into the bookings and club; the last time I played he met me in St Petersburg with his wife to come to my show, and we all took the train back to Moscow together. The clubbers arrive early and they come for the music. There is a proper stage for live sets, the sound is good, and I always have a great time. \u2022 propagandamoscow.com Chosen by Kate Simko SOUTHERN EUROPE DC10, Ibiza  DC10 is the stuff of legend \u2013 an Ibiza saga that\u2019s still going strong after heavy pressure from the Guardia Civil to close its doors.

There\u2019s an amazing dark room as you walk in which I love to play, but head out to the legendary terrace for the real freaks. It\u2019s a club where anything goes: skint 18-year-olds dance alongside A-list celebs, without a VIP table in sight.

It\u2019s revered and is one of those real after-hours style clubs \u2013 seriously going all day and night. It does a night out in Ibiza but the Barcelona club, just outside the city close to the airport, has been created by one family (all the generations are involved to a certain extent), which gives the club a great community vibe. The crowd at Elrow are serious freaks: they party in style. Think Cirque du Soleil, drag queens, confetti \u2026 I hate that kind of showbiz style night but they do it so well and with so much detail that it feels incredibly decadent. The sun is beating down, it\u2019s the middle of the day and everybody is going crazy. It\u2019s simply exciting (and I don\u2019t use that word very often!).

It\u2019s on the main promenade, and by day you can sip cocktails on the terrace with beautiful views of the Mediterranean. After sunset you can enjoy amazing sushi, steak and seafood. The service, staff, quality of food and ambience are on point. At 11pm the tables are cleared away and the dining area is transformed into a dance floor. It\u2019s one of the only places where I can still play Soulful House and dig deep for forgotten classics. From diners to clubbers the transition is smooth. I always feel like I could play another five hours after the lights come up.\u2022 cdlcbarcelona.comChosen by Sam Divine Nitsa Club, Barcelona          Nitsa has been my second home for the past five years. I spent most Fridays and Saturdays here before starting to play regularly in clubs, listening to the best artists of the moment and learning how to construct a DJ set by focusing on my favourite artists. The most special moment of a night here was always the closing sets, played amazingly by the resident DJs, especially DJ Fra (aka Ferenc) and DJ De Mierda (aka Marc Pi\u00f1ol). The best music I\u2019ve heard in a club has been in those sets, always after 6am. I remember many nights, but perhaps my two favourite ones were Jacques Lu Cont and Erol Alkan in 2004, when the crowd invaded the DJ booth and security were not able to contain all the people; and Michael Mayer and Reinhard Voigt in 2005, where Mayer signed some vinyl for me and Voigt gifted me his T-shirt during his live show! What makes Nitsa special is its eclecticism. During the same month you could hear artists from IDM to techno, from house to electro, from indie pop to drum\u2019n\u2019bass. \u2022 nitsa.com Chosen by Coyu Big Bang, Rome This venue is in a large converted house on a street that looks like a Tarantino vision of Babylon. There are late-night bars and clubs in converted buildings and medieval- looking warehouses everywhere. You get the sense that all the sins of the city have been brushed away from the tourists to this place, and this is where the real Rome underground lives. On Friday nights Big Bang becomes the Big Bang Reggae Yard and Trojan Sound play a night there called BaBaBoom Time, the best reggae party in Italy. The crowd know and feel their music and reggae speaks to them in a deep, almost spiritual way. The club has a vibe a bit like a house party, with one main room for the music and various other rooms downstairs and upstairs for people to hang out in. The club\u2019s also a big favourite of Trojan Sound System friend Coleen \u201cCosmo\u201d Murphy who also loves playing host at the venue\u2019s loft-style parties, which she tells us happen without the hype that plagues most club nights and DJs today. \u2022 bigbangroma.org Chosen by Trojan Sound System Goa, Rome          What I love about this club is the effort it regularly puts into creating a special decor. It feels like a cross between a dark cabaret and a David Lynch film, with tons of oddly framed paintings all over the walls and strange objects hanging around. The sound is tight and the booth is surrounded by people. It\u2019s a cosy personal affair and I always really enjoy playing there. \u2022 goaclub.comChosen by Magda  Casablanca Soul, Santorini, Greece In the centre of this small volcanic island, Casablanca Soul has been pioneering underground music since the early 1980s. Now it\u2019s a musical landmark and one of the biggest bookers of international DJs in the Greek islands. Santorini isn\u2019t as well-known for dance music as islands such as Mykonos, but this bar has the spirit of the music. Unlike most club and bars in Greece, this one is about the music, people and vibe. With a capacity of about 120, it\u2019s tight, to say the least, but the energy is always full-on and the luxury of having no curfew means you can play until the sun comes up. I\u2019ve moved to this island partly because of the love I have for this bar. Bliss! \u2022 casablancasoul.comChosen by osunlade Lux, Lisbon       Photograph: Alamy    Lux is widely regarded as Lisbon\u2019s top club, and with good reason. It has an amazing sound system (what bass-head doesn\u2019t have a love for Funktion Ones?), wooden dancefloors, a big terrace, and varied lineups with lots of different club nights \u2013 including our own, the bimonthly Hard Ass Sessions. The design inside is always pretty crazy. I think it regularly commissions visual artists to design pieces for the club or just have a say in the decorations and it also has these video and light installations that keep changing. It recently added some stuffed polar bears, which actually freaked me out the first time I saw them. It has also been a traditionally gay-friendly environment. It\u2019s a fun and weird place. Slightly posh but still pretty open to anyone, slightly artsy and brainy but you can still hear anything from zouk bass to heavy techno, and when you leave the club in the morning you can enjoy a drunken view of the river, which is nice. Oh, and it basically gave life to an area of Lisbon, opening the club, restaurants, a record shop and art gallery where previously there was nothing. . \u2022 luxfragil.comChosen by Jo\u00e3o Pedro Silva, Enchufada Records iBoat, Bordeaux I\u2019ve only played at iBoat once so far, but it was an instant favourite. The club is in the basement of a docked boat, with a great restaurant upstairs. The time I played there with Prosumer, and we had a nice relaxed dinner and wine, we were shocked to see the mayhem downstairs by the time we finished. People were already hanging from the rafters and it was packed. I played a live audio-visual set there and loved the fact that it had a nice LED board. It\u2019s a proper all-round club, and the booking curation is impressive.\u2022 iboat.euChosen by Kate Simko Barbarellas Discoteque, Tisno, Croatia     Photograph: Khris Cowely/Facebook    Barbarellas is run by the guys behind The Garden Festival (which hosts its final edition in summer 2015) in Tisno \u2013 also home to a Soundwave, Electric Elephant and Stop Making Sense. At the old Garden site in Petr\u010dane, Barbarellas was an indoor club with retro-1970s decor, but now it has moved it\u2019s an outdoor club that runs until 6am. The Barbarellas after-parties are legendary: DJing to a great crowd under the stars and watching the sun rise over the stunning Dalmatian coast. It\u2019s definitely one of my favourite clubs in the world, with a unique atmosphere, and I can\u2019t wait to be back there this summer.\u2022 watchthegardengrow.euChosen by DJ Gilla, First Word Records ", "sentences": ["\u2022 club-auslage.atChosen by Jane Fitz  Air, Amsterdam          Amsterdam is great for pretty much everything and even better that it\u2019s easy to get to from London.", "We have hosted some special parties but the ones that stand out are during Amsterdam Dance Event."], "title": "25 of the best clubs in Europe \u2013 chosen by the experts", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/dec/29/best-clubs-europe-club-nights-picked-by-djs", "tags": ["Bars and clubs", "Europe holidays", "Travel", "Clubbing", "Music"]}, {"publicationDate": "2014-12-29T10:00:02Z", "article": "The pioneers of the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda arrived in Arusha, Tanzania in 1996. They were destined to spend the following 18 years prosecuting those accused of responsibility in the Rwandan genocide. The lepers on the potholed avenue leading to the courthouse, who used to reach out in the hope of a gift from the rich muzungu (whites in Swahili), have vanished. And the last judges and prosecutors of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda were to have left by the end of 2014. \u201cFor the tribunal\u2019s very first hearing they had to place buckets in the courtroom to catch the leaks during the rainy season,\u201d a lawyer recalls. The steady drip set the cadence for proceedings as Georges Rutaganda, former leader of the Interahamwe militia, who brutally slaughtered the Tutsi with machetes, pleaded not guilty before Judge Laity Kama, of Senegal. This was the fourth international criminal tribunal in history, after the Nuremberg trial of Nazi war crimes, its counterpart in Tokyo, then more recently the Hague tribunal for crimes committed in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. For many years, Arusha was just a base camp for safaris into the surrounding savannah. Its new role came by default: all other potential hosts declined the offer, so Tanzania was left to accommodate the tribunal. In the course of its stay, the court tried 71 suspects: army officers, ministers, politicians, militia, priests and purveyors of propaganda. All in all it performed its duties well, though there are some grounds for the accusation that it dispensed \u201cvictor\u2019s justice\u201d. It did not bring to trial any of the former Rwandan rebels, who resorted to terror tactics, too, in their drive to end the genocide. Close to the Maasai homeland, Arusha has long attracted flocks of tourists. Some tour operators even gave them the opportunity to view the big game in the dock at the international tribunal between two safari outings. En route for Kilimanjaro, they would traipse through the public gallery in their T-shirts and sandals before transferring to the aerodrome across the road from the prison. But some 3,000 witnesses from Rwanda came here, too.

Photograph: Christophe Calais/Corbis    Originally people in Arusha only spoke Swahili. Water was in short supply and an out-of-date copy of Le Monde, gleaned by street sellers from the daily flight from Amsterdam, would cost you $5. On return flights, the cargo was generally a consignment of roses. But the aircraft did not only carry flowers. Jean Kambanda, who led the government formed a few hours after President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana\u2019s plane was shot down in 1994 (the occasion for the start of the killing in Rwanda), was flown back to The Hague and imprisoned alongside alleged Yugoslav war criminals, after pleading guilty in 1998. There this austere former banker was taught to play poker by Mladen Naletili\u0107, a militia leader from Mostar, Bosnia. Today Arusha has daily flights and 4G connections. In less than 20 years the city has been transformed. In the bar of the New Safari Hotel, Akayesu, as he is known, orders a Kilimanjaro, the local beer. The estate agent owes his nickname to Jean-Paul Akayesu, the first person ever to be convicted on charges of genocide. When the violence first started in Rwanda, in 1994, this local council leader tried to stop the slaughter, but finally gave in and joined the killers. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. What is currently troubling the estate agent is the likely drop in house prices when the court finally closes. In contrast Modest Akida, a local barrister, is delighted. \u201cWe went to the same shops, rented the same houses and all the prices soared. So it\u2019s really very good news that they\u2019re leaving at last,\u201d he says. According to a 2004 survey, ICTR staff injected more than $2.5m a month into the local economy. The court employed some 200 Tanzanian nationals. According to Kosic, a UN guard who came here from former Yugoslavia, the town is \u201ca black hole, halfway between Cape Town and Cairo\u201d. He thinks Arusha owes its prosperity to the court, \u201cbut now it has grown up and can stand on its own two feet\u201d. The ICTR attracted investors and the East African Community established its headquarters in a brand-new building next door to the court. Now the African Court on Human and People\u2019s Rights has moved in and peace talks have been held here. Arusha is beginning to see itself as Africa\u2019s Geneva. In Kijenge neighbourhood, Alfred Lotuno, an elderly Maasai, voices his concerns. \u201cTanzania has acted like a saint in Africa. We have tried to help Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan, Darfur and Somalia,\u201d he says. \u201cTanzania has become the policeman of Africa and everyone says: \u2018Tanzania, Tanzania!\u2019 But now we have al-Shabaab in Arusha and bombs are going off. So I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d In recent months the town has suffered several attacks allegedly perpetrated by the Somali Islamists, though some say it has more to do with local politics.

The quagga in the Grant Museum, part of University College London, is one of only seven remaining quagga skeletons anywhere, a cousin of the zebra which became extinct in 1883. The museum itself is a rare survivor, the last of what were once many university zoology museums in the capital. Quaggas looked like zebras which had forgotten to put on their pyjama trousers, half stripey, half plain brown. Once plentiful on the South African plains, quaggas were hunted both for their unusual skins and by stock keepers to reduce competition for food. London Zoo once had one, but it was only realised that the animal was extinct when the quagga in Amsterdam died on 12 August 1883. The zoo sent out hunters to bring back a new one and found there were none. The bones came into the Grant collection in the late 19th century, and the skeleton was mounted \u2013 the only mounted specimen in the UK \u2013 by museum technicians in 1911, but not very well. The bones were bolted onto a hand-forged iron frame, in some places by driving screws straight through fragile bones. Something unpleasantly treacle-like has oozed out around the breast bones. Even the most eagle-eyed visitors rarely spot that all the bones of the neck were actually mounted upside down, but many do notice that she only has three legs: the museum in the Rockefeller Building in University Street is still a teaching collection, and at some point the missing leg was loaned and never returned.

Credit: Print Collector/Getty Images/Hulton Archive Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images/Hulton Archive    \u201cThe files are full of copies of letters from my predecessors saying: \u2018Have you by any chance got our quagga leg and if so can we have it back?\u2019\u201d museum manager Jack Ashby said. It took a very long time for the museum to realise what a treasure it had; there are many oddities in a collection which only three years ago discovered it had half a dodo in a drawer, filed as a crocodile. In 1911 the quagga was a cheap and quick job: she was mounted with five other large skeletons for a total cost of \u00a314. \u201cTo be fair to them, they had no idea they were dealing with such a rarity,\u201d Ashby said. \u201cShe came into the collection as a zebra. It\u2019s one of the Grant\u2019s more embarrassing stories, actually. We used to have two zebras, now we have none.\u201d It was only in 1972 that experts took a really close look at the zebras. One turned out to be a donkey, now leaning rather forlornly against the balcony railings and in need of restoration work himself, and the other was revealed as the quagga. The museum\u2019s scientists take a dim view of a controversial selective breeding project in South Africa to recreate an animal which looks like a quagga, but have launched the Bone Idol fundraising appeal to restore their own specimen, along with 38 other historic skeletons in the collection, including the spectacular skull and antlers of another extinct animal, the giant Irish deer, which a group of academics bought straight off a pub wall in Ireland. The largest skeleton in the museum, a (hornless) greater Indian one-horned rhino that was part of the 1911 batch, has already been removed from display for conservation work and the quagga is next on the list. Her bones will be carefully dismantled, cleaned \u2013 the old technique of rotting off the meat by steeping skeletons in a giant tank in the university attics is no longer favoured, much to the relief of staff \u2013 and remounted on an anatomically correct support that should preserve her forever. Meanwhile, the search for her fourth leg goes on. \u2022 The Grant Museum of Zoology, UCL, London, is open free to the public, Monday-Saturday 1-5pm", "sentences": ["London Zoo once had one, but it was only realised that the animal was extinct when the quagga in Amsterdam died on 12 August 1883."], "title": "The quagga now standing on three legs is next in line for Bone Idol restoration", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/dec/30/quagga-skeleton-restoration-bone-idol-grant-museum-london", "tags": ["Zoology", "Biology", "Science", "UCL (University College London)", "Higher education", "Museums", "Education", "Museums", "Culture", "UK news", "London"]}]}
